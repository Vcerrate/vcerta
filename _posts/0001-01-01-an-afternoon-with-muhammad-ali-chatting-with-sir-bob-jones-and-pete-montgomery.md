{% raw %}Muhammad Ali visited New Zealand in February 1979 with a group of young boxers he was mentoring. He visited the local television studios for a brief promotional visit and ended staying for over 2 hours, watching clips of his fights and chatting with local boxing aficionado  Sir Bob Jones and commentating legend Pete Montgomery.....a wonderful unscripted look at a true legend......talking all things from boxing to religion with some poetry thrown in for good measure!{% endraw %}
