{% raw %}Moxie Marlinspike, OG cypherpunk and privacy legend, just announce his resignation as CEO of Signal. This was an abrupt announcement that caught much of the privacy space off-guard. <br /><br />Moxie earned the trust of the community by consistently delivering high standards that protected the privacy rights of users. Can the app still be trusted to maintain those high standards now that Moxie is no longer at the helm?  <br /><br />In this video weâ€™ll dive into the history of Signal, and reveal the surprising background of one of the team members who will be carrying the torch forward. <br /><br />Brought to you by NBTV members: Lee Rennie, Will Sandoval, and Naomi Brockwell<br /><br />To make a tax-deductible (in the US) donation to NBTV, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nbtv.media/support">https://www.nbtv.media/support</a><br /><br />Sign up for the free CryptoBeat newsletter here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cryptobeat.substack.com/">https://cryptobeat.substack.com/</a><br /><br />Beware of scammers, I will never give you a phone number or reach out to you with investment advice.
