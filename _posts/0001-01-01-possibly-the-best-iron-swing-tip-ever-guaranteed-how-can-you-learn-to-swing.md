{% raw %}How can you learn to swing a golf club without having to think about too many things?<br /><br />I woke up to this in my inbox:<br /><br />&quot;That was the most amazing golf lesson - exactly what I needed. You mention all the time that we should keep the golf swing simple but I never really believed it fully...you have no idea the impact this golf lesson has had on my game. I'm so grateful for you and your time!!&quot;<br /><br />Whoa! how nice is that...<br /><br />I absolutely love helping golfers find their golf swings. Getting feedback that they are finding the game so much easier and having much more fun on the golf course is why I do what I do. You see over the years the golf swing has been chopped up and dissected into so many pieces it can sometime feel like it will take forever to learn.<br /><br />But don't believe that. This is the old school way.<br /><br />The new school way is to learn your swing. We are all built differently, different shapes and sizes, different levels of strength and flexibility. Should we all swing it the same way?<br /><br />Take a look at the the hottest golfers in the world right now. Dustin Johnson, Mathew Wolff, Victor Hofland. They have chosen to adopt the new school way. They have chosen to find a golf swing that works for them rather than fit into a model that someone has designed.<br /><br />In this weeks golf lesson I give you an amazing golf drill that will truly help you strike the golf ball so much better, hit driver straight...but more importantly it won't require you to remember a check list of to do's before every shot. If you have questions like How do I hit a golf ball with an Iron? How can I learn to strike my irons pure every time? How do I stop hitting the ground behind the golf ball? How to hit driver straight?<br /><br />PRACTICE PLAN<br />I you like the golf lesson with my compliments you can download the PDF lesson summary and step by step practice plan.

I created this website as a resource just for you to support you on your golfing journey as I know how tricky learning this game can be‚Ä¶to say the least!<br /><br />I personally found learning the game too long and difficult in the early days. I read all the books, watched all the videos but my game was not improving. Then after studying various forms of neuro science, motor learning, psychology and personal development in less than two years I went from struggling golfer to the final stage of the Open Championship.<br /><br />On YouTube and my personal website (www.dannymaude.com) I will bring you the most up to date training, training that is getting tangible results for my clients right now.  I don‚Äôt know where you are in your golfing journey, you could be just starting out or maybe your body isn‚Äôt as flexible as it once was or you‚Äôve got ambitions to slash your handicap.  Wherever you are I‚Äôve created a place here you can learn, share your ideas, ask questions and get all the support you need to enjoy this great game.<br /><br />Be prepared though. If its a quick fix you are after Im not your man. Here I will give you step-by-step advice that you can take straight to the practice ground and apply to the course but it will require you to get stuck in, screw up‚Ä¶a lot, practice some more and then watch those scores tumbleI‚Äôve had the pleasure of coaching thousands of students all around the world and if you are up for the challenge and are ready to get in the game‚Ä¶LETS GO TO WORK!<br /><br />-----------------------<br />SUBSCRIBE!!<br />-----------------------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSwdmDQhAi_-ICkAvNBLEBw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSwdmDQhAi_-ICkAvNBLEBw?sub_confirmation=1</a>{% endraw %}
