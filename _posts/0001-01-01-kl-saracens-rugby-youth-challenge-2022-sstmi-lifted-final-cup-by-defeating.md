One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand.<br /><br />Rugby is a 15-a-side team sport. The object of the game is to ground the ball behind the opponent's try line, into what is called the in-goal area. Rugby is played both with the ball in hand and by kicking the ball. However, when the ball is being carried in hand it can only be thrown or handed off backwards.{% endraw %}
