{% raw %}We like to test all of the products we sell to ensure we're only recommending paints we would use ourselves so here is a quick Kitchen cupboard transformation tutorial using two of their gorgeous colours from their 110 colour range! <br /><br />This paint is suitable for use on melamine and wooden kitchen units without a primer and has excellent 14m2 per litre coverage so we really wanted to put it to the test. Let me know what you think and if you have any other projects you would like us to tackle!<br /><br /><br />Find the Kitchen Cupboard Paint here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.decoratingcentreonline.co.uk/paint/chalky-finish/kitchen-cupboard.html">https://www.decoratingcentreonline.co.uk/paint/chalky-finish/kitchen-cupboard.html</a>{% endraw %}
