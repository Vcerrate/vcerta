{% raw %}COME SEE ME ON TOUR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.doctormikelive.com">http://www.doctormikelive.com</a><br /><br />These SNL medical sketches killed me. Today we talk about giving birth with Amy Schumer, John Green's The Fault In Our Stars and Ebola Virus with Sarah Silverman, testicular injuries, sneezing with Kristin Wiig and Will Ferrell, dayquil, nyquil, advil, benadryl, STD's and STI's with Pete Davidson, IBS or irritable bowel syndrome,  Gen Z hospital with Elon Musk, Are there any other Saturday Night Live medical sketches I should check out?<br /><br />I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously. If there’s a subject you want me to discuss or something you’d like for me to react to, leave a comment down below. Many of my videos have been born out of suggestions directly from you, so don’t hold back!<br />-Doctor Mike Varshavski<br /><br />Help us continue the fight against medical misinformation and change the world through charity by becoming a Doctor Mike Resident on Patreon where every month I donate 100% of the proceeds to the charity, organization, or cause of your choice!
