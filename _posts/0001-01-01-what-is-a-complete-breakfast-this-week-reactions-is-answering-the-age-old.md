{% raw %}This week Reactions is answering the age old question of what makes a complete breakfast. Wake up today to a big bowl of science and chemistry. <br /><br />Itâ€™s the most important meal of the day. Or is it? Breakfast has been the topic of much debate. For years, we were told to eat a complete breakfast. But what does that even mean? Should a complete breakfast include eggs, or should you avoid them altogether? Does any of this apply to brunch?<br /><br />SOURCES:<br />Carbohydrates - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://learn.fi.edu/learn/brain/carbs.html">http://learn.fi.edu/learn/brain/carbs.html</a><br />Brain and Glucose - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22436/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22436/</a><br />Thinking Hard Uses More Glucose - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/thinking-hard-calories/">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/thinking-hard-calories/</a><br />Proteins and Appetite - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/82/1/41.full">http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/82/1/41.full</a><br />Proteins Release Dopamine - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2014/1015-eating-breakfast-increases-brain-chemical-involved-in-regulating-food-intake-and-cravings-mu-researchers-find/">http://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2014/1015-eating-breakfast-increases-brain-chemical-involved-in-regulating-food-intake-and-cravings-mu-researchers-find/</a><br />Fats - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyEating/Fats-and-Oils_UCM_304495_Article.jsp">http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyEating/Fats-and-Oils_UCM_304495_Article.jsp</a><br />Milk: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g6015?etoc=">http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g6015?etoc=</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/upshot/got-milk-might-not-be-doing-you-much-good.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/upshot/got-milk-might-not-be-doing-you-much-good.html</a><br />What Makes a Complete Breakfast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/food-and-nutrition/art-20048294?pg=1">http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/food-and-nutrition/art-20048294?pg=1</a><br /><br />Find us on all these places:<br />Subscribe! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/ACSReactions">http://bit.ly/ACSReactions</a><br />Facebook! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/ACSReactions">http://facebook.com/ACSReactions</a><br />Twitter! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/ACSReactions">http://twitter.com/ACSReactions</a><br />Tumblr! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tumblr.com/ACSReactions">http://tumblr.com/ACSReactions</a><br /><br />Smooth Talker - Dougie Wood<br /><br />Producer:<br />Elaine Seward<br /><br />Writer:<br />Elaine Seward<br /><br />Executive Producer:<br />Adam Dylewski<br /><br />Scientific consultants:<br />Matt Hartings, Ph.D.<br />Darcy Gentleman, Ph.D.<br />Sophia Cai{% endraw %}
