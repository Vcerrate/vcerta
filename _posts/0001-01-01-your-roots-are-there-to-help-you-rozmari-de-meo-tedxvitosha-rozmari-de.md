{% raw %}Rozmari De Meo is the bestselling author of Bulgaria's most successful book in recent years and is also holding seminars around the country about some of folklore's forgotten tales and traditions. Globalization is good but if we forget where we've come from, then this global exchange is no good: take care of your roots and they will take care of you, Rozmari says.  Bestselling author of the most successful book, with over 50 000 copies sold in under a year – “God’s mastress”, she self-published, thus proving that a good book does not need a large name behind it and the only important element for its success are the readers. For years Rozmari has been teaching traditional folklore practices and holding seminars on them. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
