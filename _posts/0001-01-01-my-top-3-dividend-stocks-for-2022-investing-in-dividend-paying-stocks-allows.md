{% raw %}Investing in dividend-paying stocks, allows you to share in the profits of some of the world’s most successful companies. You can reinvest these dividends to buy more shares, which creates a powerful compounding effect, or you could take them as pure cash. In this video, I’m going to highlight 3 dividend stocks that I think are a good value going into 2022. Of the three, one will have a high yield with low growth, one will have an average yield and growth, and one will have a low yield with very high growth. If you stick around to the end I have a bonus stock that I think is poised to do well in 2022 and beyond. <br /><br />Check out my website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dividenddata.com">https://www.dividenddata.com</a><br /><br />Support on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/DividendData">https://www.patreon.com/DividendData</a><br /><br />Stock Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVONgfS6daZLinCeB2peeCmdLXTh7Skmv">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVONgfS6daZLinCeB2peeCmdLXTh7Skmv</a><br />Investing Theory: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVONgfS6daZLCUyl5S7p_-4kiVYRR5YMB">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVONgfS6daZLCUyl5S7p_-4kiVYRR5YMB</a><br />Monthly Updates: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVONgfS6daZI-j-EhQcw_o6plfRHxXgkZ">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVONgfS6daZI-j-EhQcw_o6plfRHxXgkZ</a><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ5V5HyAvkFrjsWkANqXscQ?sub_confirmation=1r">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ5V5HyAvkFrjsWkANqXscQ?sub_confirmation=1r</a><br />Follow on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/dividend_data">https://twitter.com/dividend_data</a><br />Follow on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dividenddata/">https://www.instagram.com/dividenddata/</a><br />Support on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/DividendData">https://www.patreon.com/DividendData</a><br /><br />******<br />Dividend Growth Investing provides the ability to create cash flow, without selling your position in a stock.
