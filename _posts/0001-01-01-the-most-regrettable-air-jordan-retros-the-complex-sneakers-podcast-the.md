{% raw %}The Complex Sneakers Podcast is co-hosted by Joe La Puma, Brendan Dunne, and Matt Welty. This week, they talk about the ups and downs of Air Jordan retros over the past three decades, from good pairs like the “Grape” Air Jordan 5s to forgettable pairs like the “Crimson” Air Jordan 3s. Also, Wetly relives some sneaker backdoor sagas from his Foot Locker days, Joe breaks down the SWAT tactic, and the group celebrates over a platter of glizzies.<br /><br />Looking for the Complex Sneakers Podcast Dad Hats?
