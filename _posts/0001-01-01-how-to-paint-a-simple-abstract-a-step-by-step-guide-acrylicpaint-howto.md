{% raw %}#acrylicpaint #howto #painting<br />Let me show you a really simple technique for creating a beautiful piece of abstract art. I'm using lots of bright colours - anyone can have a go and have fun!<br /><br />In the first half of the video I take you through some basic preparation - what tools you will need and especially using things you may already have in the house - like sponges, cardboard and paint brushes. You can skip to around the 9:00 mark if you just want to see how the painting is created.<br /><br />I also talk about canvas, painting the background and how to finish off the edges.<br /><br />Look out for the second video here (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/oshR0xZb3Hs)">https://youtu.be/oshR0xZb3Hs)</a> where we will get straight into creating using another simple and amazing technique to make a beautiful, colourful painting - completely different to this one!<br /><br />ARE YOU NEW TO THE CHANNEL?
