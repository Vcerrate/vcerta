Click the following link and my team and I will help you choose your ideal car at a fair price - from Mat Watson! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Wow-Me-carwow">https://bit.ly/Wow-Me-carwow</a><br />.............................................................<br /><br />Check out the Bailey Discovery D4-2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Bailey-Discovery-D4-2">https://bit.ly/Bailey-Discovery-D4-2</a><br /><br />Have you ever wondered how different add-ons and accessories could reduce the range of your electric car? Well, we have, so weâ€™ve pulled together this video! Weâ€™ve got our hands on the Skoda Enyaq, and weâ€™re putting it through a series of tests to see how its claimed range holds up in different driving scenarios.<br /><br />Weâ€™ll start off fairly lightly, with Mat just driving the car as anyone normally would. Heâ€™ll then up the stakes, though, driving with everything turned up to the max, including heaters, wipers and full beams! <br /><br />But thatâ€™s not all. Once heâ€™s undertaken that test, weâ€™ll add some other equipment to the car, including a ski rack and a roof box, all the way through to towing a caravan! Oh, and donâ€™t worry, this is carwow after all, so you know weâ€™ll be launching it ðŸ˜‰ <br /><br />So what do you think, will the Enyaq's range hold up? You'll have to keep watching to find out!<br /><br />For further insights into towing with an EV, check out our dedicated page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Towing-With-EVs">https://bit.ly/Towing-With-EVs</a><br /><br />And if youâ€™d like more expert advice on caravans and towing in general, head over to the Caravan and Motorhome Clubâ€™s website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Caravan-and-Motorhome-Club-1002">https://bit.ly/Caravan-and-Motorhome-Club-1002</a><br /><br />.............................................................<br />Instagram â€“Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/carwow">http://www.instagram.com/carwow</a><br /><br />Tiktok -Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow">https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow</a><br /><br />Facebook â€“Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk">http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Twitter â€“Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk">http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Sign Up to our Newsletter â€“Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter">http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter</a><br /><br />Awkward haggling is a thing of the past with carwow.
