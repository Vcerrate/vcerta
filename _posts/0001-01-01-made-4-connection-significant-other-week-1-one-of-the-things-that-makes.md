{% raw %}One of the things that makes life so rich and rewarding is relationships. And one of the things that makes life so painful and complicated is relationships. God designed us on purpose. He made human beings in His image. What we believe about that will impact how we relate to others and inform how we behave. God is relational and designed us for connection. When we see ourselves as image bearers of a good God, we’ll see others as His image bearers and treat them accordingly. No matter the relationship, our love will be built on friendship.<br /><br />Aaron Brockett • Significant Other • Genesis 1-2<br /><br />CONNECT WITH US!<br />Engage with this message: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tpcc.org/messages">https://tpcc.org/messages</a><br />Visit our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tpcc.org">https://tpcc.org</a><br />We believe in the power of prayer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tpcc.org/prayer">https://tpcc.org/prayer</a><br /> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/traderspointcc/">https://instagram.com/traderspointcc/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TradersPointCC">https://twitter.com/TradersPointCC</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/TradersPointCC/">https://facebook.com/TradersPointCC/</a>{% endraw %}
