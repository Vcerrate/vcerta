Tom Davies, I set out alongside two other missioners on an ambitious 43-mile challenge in April 2022 to walk across the entire country of Scotland as the crow flies, from coast to coast.<br /><br />With the help of a GPS-system, we would have to keep as closely as possible to a completely straight-line route, taking me from the west coast near Ardmair to the east coast near Embo in five days. Would we become the first team to complete the mission unaided and beat GeoWizard to it? <br /><br />Ever wondered what would happen if you tried to walk in a completely straight line across an entire country? This is effectively an amateur guide that features plenty of mistakes, unintentional comedy, fear of heights and much more. It was an absurd, stressful, exhausting and downright painful adventure!{% endraw %}
