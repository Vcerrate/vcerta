{% raw %}If you haven’t watched James Cameron’s oft-lampooned 2009 box office goliath Avatar in a while – and let’s be honest, most people haven’t seen it since like… 2009 – you may have forgotten quite a few of the little details throughout. Or maybe you missed these Easter eggs and filmmaking deets from the get-go! Here’s a list with a few, including something special just to the theatrical cut, the opening shot. In this moment our protagonist, Jake Sully, is doused in blue light in his cryo tube on the way to Pandora. This is a pretty direct reference to where he’ll end up in the film: in a new, blue body. There’s quite a few allusions to his final state as a full-on Na’vi – for example he has the line “one life ends, another begins”, while watching his brother being cremated. Not only does this allude to his mind being permanently placed in his Avatar, but it sorta alludes to the destruction of the Hometree – both Jake’s brother and the Hometree are burned, and both these actions are steps toward our characters moving forward with a new life. That’s probably me thinking too much about it. OH ALSO Jake is the first warrior to have an Avatar, and so his mind is considered more empty than the scientists, more easily molded by the Na’vi, hence his being chosen to learn their ways by Neytiri’s mother Mo’at.<br /><br />Also Jake’s hair grows out naturally throughout the film, showing us the audience time passing by within the story. Jake first arrives on Pandora on May 19th, and he goes full blue on August 24th. Anyway, watch the video for the full list. Not sure why you’re still reading this. <br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant</a><br /><br />Chapters:<br />0:00 - Intro <br />0:13 - Blue Face<br />1:40 - Unobtanium isn’t QUITE as dumb as you thought!<br />2:59 - The Avatars Have Eyebrows<br />3:26 - Six Limbs<br />4:05 - Banshees<br />4:21 - Jake’s Early Run-in With Toruk<br />4:56 - US Imperialism<br />6:05 - The Lorax<br />6:15 - Terminator Salvation <br />7:11 - “Don’t play with that you’ll go blind.”<br />7:21 - Jake’s Hair<br />8:02 - Stanford<br />8:37 - Sigourney’s Cigarette<br />9:35 - Real Legs, Kinda<br />10:03 - Alien Connection<br /><br />Check out Screen Rant’s official TikTok! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@screenrant">https://www.tiktok.com/@screenrant</a> <br /><br />Our Social Media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/screenrant">https://twitter.com/screenrant</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant">https://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant</a>  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/screen-rant/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/screen-rant/</a> <br /><br />Our Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://screenrant.com/">http://screenrant.com/</a><br /><br />Written by: Michael Keene<br />Narrated by: Michael Keene<br />Edited by: Michael Keene<br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com{% endraw %}
