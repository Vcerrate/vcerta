{% raw %}Prince Harry attended the Super Bowl with his cousin Princess Eugenie. It made for a surprise pairing as many wonder why on earth Meghan would miss out on such an opportunity. Some have said that due to her political ambitions she didn't want to be seen with Eugenie due to the messy legal issues Prince Andrew was in. <br /><br />Andrew has now dropped his intentions for a huge jury Court Case and has agreed a settlement of up to Â£12 million if you believe the reports. The figures have changed somewhat as had who is paying. It is hard to know what to believe, but one things is clear, the UK public need to have clarity that not a single penny comes from taxpayers money, which includes any of the Duchy purses!<br /><br />Prince William has done a wonderful gesture and used his connection to make a little boys dream come true. These are the stories we need to see more of rather than two Dukes who need exiling and titles stripping. Harry and Andrew must be cut off entirely to stop the rot that is eating away at the Royal Family. <br /><br />Taz xx{% endraw %}
