{% raw %}Breaking world records on the LifeSteal SMP: a Minecraft Server where you can steal other players' hearts... Over the past few days, I've done all sorts of crazy things like Killing my Friends to Break a Minecraft Record.<br /><br />Like ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. <br /><br />LifeSteal Members in this video:@ClownPierce @Vort3xDragon @Leowook @rekrap2 @TheTerrain @ashswag @MrCube6 @McClutch @Spoke @Mapicc @PrinceZam <br /><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/6dug29UrRH">https://discord.gg/6dug29UrRH</a><br />LifeSteal Discord: discord.gg/lifesteal<br /><br />A Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms! Enjoy! This was made on LifeSteal SMP Season 3.{% endraw %}
