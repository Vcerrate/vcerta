{% raw %}Welcome to Earth Relaxation !<br />Bali is a province of Indonesia and the westernmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. East of Java and west of Lombok, the province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan. The provincial capital, Denpasar, is the most populous city in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the second-largest, after Makassar, in Eastern Indonesia. Bali is one of the most famous island in the Indonesian archipelago. The island‚Äôs home to an ancient culture that's known for its warm hospitality. Something unique can be found about climate in Bali. Even when it rains most times in the most parts of Bali you can often enjoy sunny days on the ‚ÄúBukit‚Äù, the hill south of Jimbaran.
