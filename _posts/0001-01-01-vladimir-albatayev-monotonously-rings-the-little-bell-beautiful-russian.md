{% raw %}&quot;Siberia, year 1852. Dead frozen body of a coachman was found and in his bag a notebook full of handwritten poems. Name of poet was Ivan Makarov, completely unknown at that time. One year later these poems were published and music composer Alexander Gurilev wrote music on the poem he liked most : The Lonely coach bell, nowadays erroneously named “ The monotous bell” “Little bell” or “ Monotonously rings a bell”.<br /><br />Maybe it is  'Monotonously Rings the Little Bell.' I think in Russian it is 'Adnazvutshno Gremit Kalakoltshik.' Singer is Vladimir Albatayev, born in the Republic of Buryatia, in Siberia. Russian speakers please correct me if I am wrong ?{% endraw %}
