{% raw %}This is easily one of the best release this year and probably one of the best debut this year... In my opinion. This was near perfection. I think one of the reason why I love this so much is because of how simple it was: straightforward, no brainer, clean, catchy. No brutal genre change and no melody that I would have to learn to enjoy. This was a bowl of fresh air in this 4th gen not gonna lie. This has a very editorial, model esque edge to it which makes me want to run down a runway and feel myself. This is like a subtle confidence and  I love it so so so much! <br />The girls looks so good and I am glad that I manage to notice all the members, even though some definitely grabbed my attention more. <br />Basically this was near perfection... if only there wasn't that dance part where they're on the floor. FFS there are minors in this group isn't there? They could have easily avoided this dance move but they didn't ? I don't get it. <br />Other than that, this is GREAT! <br /><br />→ Watch the MV here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vbDFu0PUew">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vbDFu0PUew</a><br /><br />_____________________<br />🔅Find me on Patreon here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/gzbkarma">https://patreon.com/gzbkarma</a><br />🔅Find my merch here : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gzbkarma.creator-spring.com/">https://gzbkarma.creator-spring.com/</a><br />🔅Follow me on TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gzbkarma76?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@gzbkarma76?lang=en</a><br />🔅Follow me on Instagram : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gzbkarma/">https://www.instagram.com/gzbkarma/</a><br />🔅Follow me on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gzbkarma">https://twitter.com/gzbkarma</a><br />🔅For any business inquiry: eurasienne76@gmail.com<br /><br />You can shop on those websites and use my code/link to save up some money.
