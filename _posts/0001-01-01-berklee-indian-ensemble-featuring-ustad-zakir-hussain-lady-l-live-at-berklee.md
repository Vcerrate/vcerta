{% raw %}The Berklee Indian Ensemble is proud to present “Lady L” featuring Grammy-winning Indian tabla master, Zakir Hussain. Composed by L. Shankar and featuring John McLaughlin, &quot;Lady L” was  originally performed by 'Shakti', the 1970s indo-jazz fusion group and appeared on the group's second studio album titled &quot;A Handful of Beauty&quot;. The group featured John McLaughlin (guitar), Zakir Hussain (tabla), L Shankar (Violin) and Vikku Vinayakram (Percussion). <br /><br />One of our listeners inspired us to go further than the Shakti album credits for the origins of this composition. It is possible that L. Shankar was inspired by Bharathiyar’s “Vellai Thamarai” - They use the same raga, and the title, “Lady L” and lyrics offer a clue.<br /><br />Vellai Thamarai is a song for Goddess Saraswathi. While the lyrics never mention her by name, they allude to her innate talent, skill, and attributes. Perhaps Lady L stands for Lady Lotus, as Goddess Saraswathi sits on a lotus flower. We’re curious to learn more, so feel free to add comments and enlighten us!<br /><br />In 2019, Berklee College of Music presented Ustad Zakir Hussain with an Honorary Doctorate. It was the perfect opportunity for our Berklee Indian Ensemble musicians to reinterpret such an iconic composition and collaborate on this live performance with Ustad Zakir Hussain as part of our week long celebration of the maestro’s life and musical accomplishments leading up to his Honorary Doctorate ceremony. <br /><br />“Lady L&quot; composed by L.
