We thoroughly enjoyed our season of motorized RVing and appreciate that we were able to share our experience in Class As, Bs, and Cs with the KYD Community. But based on the way we travel‚Äînot to mention how fast we travel‚Äîthe F250 and Airstream is the best match for us. It's good to be back. But not without a de-winterizing snafu! In this episode, Marc picks up the Airstream from Woodlands in Grand Rapids and drives 1,239 miles, stopping for just one overnight near Atlanta. We tried and failed to park the Airstream at the new KYD Bungalow, so we set up at an RV park instead to get the rig prepped for our upcoming trip.<br />De-winterizing should be a simple task‚Äîbut this time, we ran into a couple of issues that set us back a day or two.<br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è KYD Insiders <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/KeepYourDaydream">https://www.patreon.com/KeepYourDaydream</a> <br />Join the most supportive and genuine RV community ever.
