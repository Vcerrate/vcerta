They need to be loose. This is the best golf drill I've found that is sure to loosen you up.  Yes, it's weird and different at first but if you keep doing it you'll finally get that effortless swing that'll hit the ball long and straight.  <br /><br />There are many reasons why people try to hit hard with their arms.  They want to hit the ball hard, they're trying to keep the lead arm straight etc.  Although an effortless golf swing doesn't feel powerful in your arms it'll hit the ball just as far, if not farther, than your hard, fast golf swing. <br /><br />So if you are someone who's arms are all tight and locked up, this really is the best golf drill you can be doing to finally let go and stop trying to kill it.  Give this drill about 10 mins to get used to this new looser feeling.  Once you do, you will finally get this effortless feeling and you'll be playing pain free golf as well.<br /><br />Free samples from my Body Swing book and video series here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bodyswing.com/freesamples/">https://bodyswing.com/freesamples/</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------<br />My Websites<br />-------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ignitiongolf.com">https://ignitiongolf.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paulwilsongolf.com">https://paulwilsongolf.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bodyswing.com">https://bodyswing.com</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://swingmachinegolf.com">https://swingmachinegolf.com</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://howtohitdriver.com">http://howtohitdriver.com</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------<br />My App<br />-------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Work with me live from anywhere in the world through my new app called COACHLINK.<br />Available for both Apple and Android devices.
