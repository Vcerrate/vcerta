Meanwhile, the Dark Apostles are invading Harth from another dimension through a space-time rift, their objectives still unknown.<br />Massive Realm Wars<br />Along each faction's territorial borders lie fortresses packed with manamechs, artillery, and soldiers. Both factions are called to hold their ground in massive Realm vs Realm wars!<br /><br />Extensive Skill Customization<br />A plethora of skill addons, runestones, and &quot;Mana Awakening&quot; are at your disposal. Combine them and create your own combat style, from bursty glass-cannons to tanky front-liners.<br />Dimensional Portals<br />Cross these purple-shaded portals to reach planes filled with rich resources that will help you get stronger, but be prepared - both factions have unrestricted access to them.<br />Dungeons<br />Gather your friends to tackle fearsome bosses with complex mechanics and multiple phases. Feel like challenging yourself? Enter the solo floor-based dungeons and test your limits!<br /><br />Choose Your Path<br />Whether you are a solitary traveller, looking for a party, or fighting with a Clan, a vast open world awaits, filled with all kinds of challenges and secrets - on the ground, and in the air. Field bosses, treasure hunts, riddle quests, instanced &amp; open world housing, lifeskills, and so much more await!<br /><br />---Tags---<br />Elyon, Ascent Infinite Realm, A:IR, TERA, Black Desert Online, BDO, Bluehole, Steam, Free To Play, High Fantasy, Steam Punk, Open World, Action Combat Gameplay, First Impressions, 2022, MMORPG, MMO, PVP, PVE, World Bosses, Grinding, Korean, F2P, P2W, Kakao Games, TheLazyPeon, Player Housing, Builds, Warrior, Crafting, Gathering, End Game, Realm Vs Realm, Arena, RVR, 1v1, 3v3, 1vX, Update, Expansion, Pets, Mounts, elyon 2022<br />__________________________<br />Elyon 2022 First Impressions &quot;Is It Worth Playing?&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/cjLi2arQtIk">https://youtu.be/cjLi2arQtIk</a>{% endraw %}
