{% raw %}Hotel Review: Premier Inn London King's Cross, London, England - July 2021: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DKoMwfNOTnc">https://youtu.be/DKoMwfNOTnc</a> . <br /> <br />The Premier Inn London King's Cross is excellently located for both King's Cross and St. Pancras International Railway Stations. The hotel, which is on York Way is adjacent to King's Cross station, literally a 1 minute walk from the station exit. <br /> <br />The hotel seems to be quite a new building and is built around a large and bright central atrium / hallway. It has three lifts / elevators, although only two were in use during our stay. <br /><br />Two of us stayed at this hotel for 8 nights in a Premier Plus room on a room only basis, which cost £561.50. This is a bargain price for central London, which is usually incredibly expensive. We stayed during the ending of Covid-19 restrictions in England, in July 2021. <br /> <br />Our room (326) was very comfortable, with a large king-sized bed, air-conditioning, wardrobe, desk, stool, vanity area, comfy chair, foot-stool, luggage bench and a fridge. <br /><br />The bathroom was quite compact, disappointingly so and had a shower over a bath-tub. I wasn't happy about this as my expectation had been for a shower cubicle and a separate bath. I do not like having to climb over the bath-tub to take a shower. <br /> <br />Other than this, the room and bathroom were good and served their functions well. <br /><br />The hotel was quite stylish, it had an attractive atrium area where the lobby / reception are located, as well as a restaurant and a Costa Coffee. <br /> <br />Overall I was very pleased with this hotel and will definitely consider staying here again in future. <br /> <br />Would you like £15 off of your next hotel booking with Booking.com? if so please click on this link to make your booking: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.booking.com/s/9bbbc531">https://www.booking.com/s/9bbbc531</a><br /><br />This film is a Moss Travel Media production – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.mosstravel.tv">http://www.mosstravel.tv</a> <br /><br />If you liked this film, please subscribe to my YouTube channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/stuartmoss">https://www.youtube.com/user/stuartmoss</a> in order to receive updates of my future film uploads. <br /><br />If you like my travel films, you may also like my Moss Home and Garden channel, which is themed around cooking and gardening, you can find that here: www.mosshomeandgarden.co.uk <br /><br />You can also find my travel films and photography updates on the following social media: <br /><br />Blogger: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://mosstraveltv.blogspot.co.uk">http://mosstraveltv.blogspot.co.uk</a>  <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/mosstravel">https://www.facebook.com/mosstravel</a> **please like my Facebook page**<br /><br />Google+ just add +stuartmoss <br /><br />Instagram: stumoss - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/stumoss/">https://instagram.com/stumoss/</a> <br /><br />LiveJournal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://stuartmoss.livejournal.com/">http://stuartmoss.livejournal.com/</a> <br /><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://uk.pinterest.com/mosstraveltv/">https://uk.pinterest.com/mosstraveltv/</a> <br /><br />WordPress: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://mosstraveltv.wordpress.com">http://mosstraveltv.wordpress.com</a>   <br /><br />StumbleUpon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/stumbler/stumoss">http://www.stumbleupon.com/stumbler/stumoss</a> <br /><br />Tumblr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://stuartmoss.tumblr.com">http://stuartmoss.tumblr.com</a> <br /><br />Twitter @mosstraveltv or <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mosstraveltv">https://twitter.com/mosstraveltv</a> <br /><br />VKontakte: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vk.com/mosstravelmedia">https://vk.com/mosstravelmedia</a> <br /><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/stuartmoss">https://www.youtube.com/user/stuartmoss</a> <br /><br />I hope that you enjoyed this film and will return again in future, your support is really appreciated, by subscribing above you will be kept informed of my travel updates and new films uploaded. <br /><br />Thank you and bon voyage!{% endraw %}
