{% raw %}This film contrasts some recently built trains which serve London and the South East that have a rather bland colour palette and a train which serves Paris and the Isle de France region which has brightly coloured seating, starlight effect ceiling lights and ceiling panels which change colour depending on whether the train is accelerating, braking, coasting, or calling at a station.<br /><br />Also briefly explored is the topic of uncomfortable seats.{% endraw %}
