{% raw %}We challenged chefs of three different skill levels - amateur Emily, home cook Daniel, and professional chef Yuji Haraguchi of Okonomi and Yuji Ramen - to make us a batch of their go-to buffalo wings. Once each level of chef had served up and sampled their creations, we asked expert food scientist Rose to explain the choices each wingmeister made along the way - both good and bad. Which are you reaching for first, a drum or a flat?<br /><br /><br /><br />Find Chef Yuji and his restaurants on Instagram at @haraguchiyuji, @okonomibk and @yujiramen_bk<br /><br />Find Daniel at @iamdanielvictor<br /><br />Keep up with Emily on her YouTube channel at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/emilyduncan">http://youtube.com/emilyduncan</a> and on Instagram at @emilyslamduncan<br /><br />Looking for Rose?
