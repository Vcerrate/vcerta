{% raw %}Struggling to get booked for comedy gigs? Don't know what you are doing wrong? Do you even know where to look for gigs? Then this video is for you. Matt Hoss is the promoter and comedy booker for Funny Rabbit comedy at the Gulbenkian Theatre as well as many other nights for the last 7 years. In this video he will explain dutifully the do's and dont's of what you should when you are applying for gigs. This video is to help open-mic comedians secure some gigs and it's to help professional comedians make the essential bookings for their business. These are my opinions, but they're honest tips that you won't hear elsewhere. Some are more basic than others, but I really wish I had known all of these things when I first started out. <br /><br />Matt Hoss has been a stand-up comedian for over 10 years, has written over five stand-up comedy hours, written comedy for BBC, and has a Masters Degree in Stand-up Comedy. <br /><br />What tips did I miss out?
