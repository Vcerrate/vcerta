{% raw %}üìπ  In This Video:<br /><br />I reveal what the future of colleges and higher education will likely look like in the next decade to come. This goes into the fact that most colleges as we know it have a high chance of going bankrupt.<br /><br />This concept has been laid out by a Harvard Professor (Clayton Christensen) who says Half of All Colleges Won't Exist in 10 Years (and Why a New Model Might Provide a Better Path to Career Success):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/a-harvard-professor-says-half-of-all-colleges-wont-exist-in-10-years-and-why-a-new-model-might-provide-a-better-path-to-career-success.html">https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/a-harvard-professor-says-half-of-all-colleges-wont-exist-in-10-years-and-why-a-new-model-might-provide-a-better-path-to-career-success.html</a><br /><br />Watch the full video to discover what the future of education holds and how technology is allowing online education to thrive. The past year and a half has only progressed this transition at an even faster pace.<br /><br />If you are looking for a credible online learning platform to learn all things coding, digital marketing, freelancing, and more, I highly suggest the ZTM Academy which I mentioned in the video. Check out all the courses they offer here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/?affcode=441520_7y_caadc">https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/?affcode=441520_7y_caadc</a><br /><br />Please leave a comment, hit the thumbs up button, and be sure to subscribe if you like this video.
