{% raw %}Prince Andrew has suggested that the photo of him with his arm around 17-year-old sex slave Virginia Roberts was faked and has commissioned investigators to examine it.<br /><br />Andrew says his clothes in the picture, supposedly taken at Ghislaine Maxwell’s Belgravia house in March 2001, were “travelling clothes” and not what he would wear on London nights out.<br /><br />But The Sun on Sunday found pictures of him in near-identical attire on a 2001 night out in the capital.<br /><br />Here, we look at the Duke of York's main arguments following his bombshell TV interview on BBC Newsnight with Emily Maitlis.<br /><br />THE Prince claimed he had never been upstairs in Maxwell’s townhouse.<br /><br />He said: “The photograph is taken upstairs and I don’t think I ever went upstairs in Ghislaine’s house.”<br /><br />Asked if he was sure, he said: “Yeah, because the dining room and everything was on the ground floor.”<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10362585/prince-andrew-many-denials-about-infamous-sex-slave-photo-after-car-crash-tv-interview/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10362585/prince-andrew-many-denials-about-infamous-sex-slave-photo-after-car-crash-tv-interview/</a><br /><br />From Brexit breaking news to HD movie trailers, The Sun newspaper brings you the latest news videos and explainers from the UK and around the world.<br /><br />Become a Sun Subscriber and hit the bell to be the first to know<br /><br />Read The Sun: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk">http://www.thesun.co.uk</a><br />Like The Sun on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thesun/">https://www.facebook.com/thesun/</a><br />Follow The Sun on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheSun">https://twitter.com/TheSun</a><br />Subscribe to The Sun on Snapchat: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.snapchat.com/discover/The_Sun/1633225139">https://www.snapchat.com/discover/The_Sun/1633225139</a>{% endraw %}
