{% raw %}I'm not a strat guy at heart, but no collection/tool box is complete without one so I decided to pony up and buy a Fender Custom Shop and see for myself how it compares to my Suhr Classic Pro I've owned for a few years now. My new guitar is a 2020 Fender Custom Shop 65 Journeyman Stratocaster in one of my favorite color combo's ever, Charcoal Frost Metallic with a tort pickguard. The pickups were swapped to Seymour Duncan Antiquity II Surfers by the original owner, which from what I could find online most people deemed an &quot;upgrade&quot;. I thought comparing it to just my Suhr would be a bit odd, mainly due to the humbucker vs single coil bridge so I asked my buddy Sean if he'd be interested in partaking in a bigger comparison of our four S-style guitars. Thankfully he agreed and we were able to shoot this video!<br /><br />Do him a solid for making this video possible and follow him on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/seanhanlonguitar/">https://www.instagram.com/seanhanlonguitar/</a><br /><br />So what'd you think? Comment below your favorites  and why! <br /><br />Stay tuned, we're going to swap the pickguards on the Xotic and Fender and install the same set of strings to see how much of a difference the pickups really make.
