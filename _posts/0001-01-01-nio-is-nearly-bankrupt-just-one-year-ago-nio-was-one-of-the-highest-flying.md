{% raw %}Just one year ago, NIO was one of the highest-flying EV startups on the stock market as it rode the hype that accompanied Tesla’s exponential ascent. But, ever since then, NIO hasn’t been fairing too well; in fact, they’re nearly bankrupt. At the end of Q3 2021, NIO only had about $500 million in the bank which sounds good until you take into account that they’re currently burning about $400 million per quarter. To avoid bankruptcy, NIO raised $2 billion in November which bought them a few more quarters but with NIO stock being down 80% from their all-time highs, it’s going to be even harder to raise money right now. To make things worse, given the NIO is just now starting to ramp up production into the hundreds of thousands, it’s going to be extremely difficult to become profitable within the next few quarters. This video explains the various factors that are weighing down NIO and if NIO can survive the sticky situation that they’re currently in. <br /><br />Discord Community: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/SJUNWNt">https://discord.gg/SJUNWNt</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />0:00 - NIO’s Fragile Position<br />1:24 - William Li<br />3:29 - BitAuto<br />5:39 - NIO<br />8:30 - NIO’s Three Strikes<br />11:01 - NIO’s Savior<br /><br />Resources: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/Yi9s1uy1">https://pastebin.com/Yi9s1uy1</a>{% endraw %}
