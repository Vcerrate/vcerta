This rifle was widely associated to US special operation forces and US Army Rangers from the 2008-2010 era being fielded in very limited numbers. <br /><br />It was the rifle that could have become the future of the U.S. military by way of SOCOM, but at the end, it was rejected due to fragility and reliability issues... but FN has spend the time since then working out a lot of the product issues and offering it to the civilian market amongst other foreign governments (like the Belgian military and special operations forces). <br /><br />So how does the product improved model do on our range? We find out! <br /><br /><br />FYI, Swiss TAZ90 camo was purchased from Mike's Militaria @Mike B , no idea how he got a hold of them, but it certainly satisfies the camo nerd in us! <br /><br />Consider supporting us via Patreon ðŸ‘‰  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/9HoleReviews">http://www.patreon.com/9HoleReviews</a> (you an also access the Practical Accuracy Scoreboard here)<br /><br />Observer setup seen here powered by: <br />- Vortex Optics Razor HD Spotting Scope 27-60x85 Angled<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2M3zTGP">https://amzn.to/2M3zTGP</a><br />- Vortex Optics Pro GT Tripod<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2X7j6sL">https://amzn.to/2X7j6sL</a><br />- Phone Skope Lollipop Universal Digiscoping kit<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZK50zk">https://amzn.to/2ZK50zk</a><br /><br />We have a discount for Slate Black Industries MLOK accessories! <br />ðŸ‘‰ www (dot) slateblackindustries (dot) com <br />Discount code: 9HOLE<br /><br />Shopping with this link costs you nothing, but provides us with equipment: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/?tag=sbi09-20">https://www.amazon.com/?tag=sbi09-20</a><br /><br />This video's editing by Agency Communications LLC<br />Music by Tyops (THANKS!!!)<br /><br />__________________________________________________________________<br />We love mail:<br />9 Hole Reviews<br />21175 Tomball Pkwy.
