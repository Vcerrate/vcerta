Fuelled by lifelong rejection, maternal abandonment, and abuse to empower self-love within each other, Orren and Robert are here to shake up your expectations of long-term love and tell you that the time to start being yourself is NOW! 🙌🏼<br /><br />Unapologetically attached at the hip - yet fiercely individual - these lovebirds will teach you to:<br /><br />🌟 Not let other people’s judgments and projections stop you from showing up authentically<br />🌟 Allow love into your life through vulnerability by letting go of your need to protect your heart <br />🌟 Recognize that boundaries are the most loving thing you can do for yourself and the ones you love (is there anything harder but more true?!) <br />🌟 Appreciate the little things in life that you may take for granted, like the unparalleled intimacy of holding someone’s hand<br /><br />About StyleLikeU <br />If you agree that facades separate us and being radically honest brings us together, please take a moment to subscribe to our channel and share this video with any friends or family who could benefit from feeling less alone in their journeys with mental health.
