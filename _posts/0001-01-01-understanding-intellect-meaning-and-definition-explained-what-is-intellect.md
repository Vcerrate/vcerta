{% raw %}What is the INTELLECT and what does it mean? Understanding the Intellect (meaning and definition) is of great benefit to all Spiritual Wisdom Seekers of Higher Truth. The Intellect is different than intelligence, intuition and wisdom. It is the mind's faculty of reasoning and objective understanding and is differentiated from will, emotion, instinct and personality. It is the mind's capacity to learn and acquire knowledge, especially of a high, superior, or complex order. It is useful and practical for learning and comprehending Philosophy, Science, Religion and Spiritual teachings, increasing and improving intellectual capacities, but in the end it is quite limited, as it is still a quality and aspect of the lower ego thinking mind. Leaders and teachers such as Sadhguru, Mooji, Eckhart Tolle, Dr. David R Hawkins, and all Indian Gurus and spiritual masters explain, define and describe the limitations of the human intellect and the thinking mind. (Spiritual imposters do as well.) Using one's free will to advance, grow, and develop on the path through the acquisition of Higher Spiritual information may lead to intellectual spirituality and the inflation of the ego personality, elevating pride, arrogance, and emotional feelings of superiority. Using the memory of the mind to store and recall spiritual lessons solely for intellectual reasons, is a downfall. The Universal lessons learned by the intellectual mind need to be assimilated, integrated and practiced to develop into spiritual intelligence. It is the meaning and the essence of the teachings that are important. Yoga means to unite with God, Self and the Holy, Absolute Truth of your Being, the Nondual Absolute Truth of Reality. This is beyond the ordinary thinking mind, and is in the Realm of Spirit, Consciousness and Awareness. Letting go of negative emotion and escapist behaviors will lead one up. Spiritual focus, dedication, and motivation will improve and increase one's frequency, vibration, and level of consciousness. Virtuous practices such as meditation, mantra recitation, prayer, mindfulness, unconditional love, forgiveness, honesty, humility and surrender at great depths will assist in transforming the spiritual intellectual information into experience, increasing wellness and vitality. Spiritual genius is within us all. Raw Mystic philosophy teaches that Intuition, instinct, will, and wisdom are not of the mind, they are of the Soul, Spirit, Consciousness, and Awareness. The logic, reason, intelligence and knowledge of the intellect will get one only so far. Guard your body, speech, and mind. Purify your negative karma, Salvation, Enlightenment, and Higher Spirituality await you on your life journey.  <br /><br />📺 𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐧𝐞𝐱𝐭<br />The 10 Spiritual Laws of the Universe<br />►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SrSGCsWC2XE">https://youtu.be/SrSGCsWC2XE</a><br />Understanding NON DUALITY<br />►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mXZye2j5oX8">https://youtu.be/mXZye2j5oX8</a><br />Who Is God<br />►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ZdlJs7AEc5o">https://youtu.be/ZdlJs7AEc5o</a><br />Awareness, Spirituality and HIGHER SELF<br />►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/HlAyLZlUf7k">https://youtu.be/HlAyLZlUf7k</a><br /><br />𝐖𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐞𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬?
