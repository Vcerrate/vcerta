{% raw %}I received some terrifying news, most people have no idea how bad its going to get. <br /><br />The Ukraine is the breadbasket of Europe, Russia is the energy supply. Without these two things the price of food and fuel skyrockets. Countries around the world are stockpiling grain. Record drought looms overhead putting more pressure on farmers. The supply chain is in shambles and the push for conflict is unrelenting. The next wave is also not too far off, and authoritarianism will rear its ugly head to quell the socioeconomic unrest. You need to get what you can while the getting is good. <br /><br />CANADIAN PREPPERS STORE / Premium Survival/ Emergency Equipment<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://canadianpreparedness.com/">https://canadianpreparedness.com/</a><br /><br />Gasmasks and Protective Equipment<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/first-aid">https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/first-aid</a><br /><br />Emergency Food Supplies <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/food">https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/food</a><br /><br />Survival Tools<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/all-tools">https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/all-tools</a><br /><br />Shelter and Sleep Systems<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.canadianpreparedness.com/product-categories/shelter/">https://www.canadianpreparedness.com/product-categories/shelter/</a><br /><br />Water Filtration<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/water-filtration">https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/water-filtration</a><br /><br />Cooking Systems<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/cookware">https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/cookware</a><br /><br />Silky Saws<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/silky-saws-canadian-prepper">https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/silky-saws-canadian-prepper</a><br /><br />Flashlights &amp; Navigation<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/electronics">https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/electronics</a><br /><br />Survival Gear/ Misc<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/protection-hunting">https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/protection-hunting</a><br /><br />Fire Starting<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/fatrope-firestarter-canadian-prepper">https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/fatrope-firestarter-canadian-prepper</a><br /><br />Hygiene<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/towels">https://canadianpreparedness.com/collections/towels</a>{% endraw %}
