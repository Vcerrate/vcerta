{% raw %}This week, Cal is at Doug Duren’s farm outside of Cazenovia, Wisconsin hunting deer and talking Chronic Wasting Disease. Home to our good friend, Cazenovia is also ground zero for CWD, a 100% fatal and highly transmissible prion based disease. Join Cal as he hunts with Doug to see first hand how CWD is changing Wisconsin whitetail deer hunting traditions.<br />#meateater #fueledbynature <br /><br />Want to spend more time with Cal? Tune in every Sunday for Cal’s Week in Review, a podcast delivering a unique spin on outdoor news designed for folks that need to know what’s going on, and those who want to pretend they do.
