{% raw %}Amazon Labor Union leader Chris Smalls defended workers Thursday after a passionate defense of corporations by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., during a hearing on labor laws.<br /><br />Graham defended corporations who had faced recent unionization efforts and attacked laws that would prevent them from swaying a union election.<br /><br />“I think it is patently illegal. This is a heavy handed approach,&quot; Graham said in his opening remarks before the Senate Budget Committee, adding that  it was part of &quot;the most radical agenda&quot; he had seen in his lifetime.<br /><br />Graham said if Republicans won enough seats to take control of the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections, attacks on corporations would stop.<br /><br />“If we take this body back, this demonization of individual companies that are subject to the law will cease,” Graham said.<br /><br />Speaking immediately after Graham, Smalls said it sounded like the senator was focused on companies and businesses, &quot;but you forgot that the people are the ones who make these companies operate.&quot;<br /><br />“If we’re not protected, and the process for when we hold these companies accountable is not working for us, then that's the reason why we’re here today,&quot; he added.<br /><br />Smalls said it would be in Graham’s “best interest” to listen.<br /><br />“It's not a left or right thing, it’s not a Democrat or Republican thing. It’s a worker’s thing. It’s a worker’s issue and we’re the ones that are suffering in the corporations that you're talking about, in the businesses that you're talking about, in the warehouses that you're talking about,&quot; Smalls said.<br />“That's the reason why I think I was invited today to speak on that behalf and you should listen because we do represent your constituents as well,&quot; he added.<br /><br />Stream your PBS favorites with the PBS app: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://to.pbs.org/2Jb8twG">https://to.pbs.org/2Jb8twG</a><br />Find more from PBS NewsHour at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour">https://www.pbs.org/newshour</a><br />Subscribe to our YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2HfsCD6">https://bit.ly/2HfsCD6</a><br /><br />Follow us:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour">http://www.pbs.org/newshour</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/newshour">http://www.twitter.com/newshour</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/newshour">http://www.instagram.com/newshour</a><br /><br />Subscribe:<br />PBS NewsHour podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts</a><br />Newsletters: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/subscribe">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/subscribe</a>{% endraw %}
