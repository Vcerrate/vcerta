{% raw %}Bruce Stringfellow gives a detailed Walkaround tour of his HIND MI-24 Soviet Helicopter. This is the most detailed video of the Hind that I can find, I hope you enjoy it!!<br /><br />And for everyone worried about Bruce stepping on the cowlings labeled Do Not Stand, well it means donâ€™t stand on that specific part and these cowlings are designed to be stood on as a kind of work stand as you can see from where his feet are, the cowlings are flat and reinforced. <br /><br />Sponsors:<br />Flying Eyes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://flyingeyesoptics.com/eyewear?ref=ZpQC4rT3M0z7V">https://flyingeyesoptics.com/eyewear?ref=ZpQC4rT3M0z7V</a><br /><br />Air Models: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://airmodels.net/?aff=57">https://airmodels.net/?aff=57</a><br /><br />John's 360 Coatings: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://johns360coatings.com">https://johns360coatings.com</a>{% endraw %}
