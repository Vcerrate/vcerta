In the late 1940s, one company posed that question. Lustron was a prefabricated home that was supposed to be the future of housing. So why did it fail?<br /><br />For just a few years â€” 1947 to 1950 â€” the Columbus, Ohio-based Lustron represented the future of housing. Using a steel frame and porcelain enamel-covered steel panels, Lustron made homes in a factory and shipped them around the country.<br /><br />Voxâ€™s Phil Edwards visited a Lustron home just outside Dayton, Ohio, to experience the unusual features, like magnetic walls, for himself. This homeâ€™s quirks werenâ€™t relegated to the materials. Through a combination of government funding sources, an attempt to reinvent the production cycle for home, and a unique distribution plan, the Lustron home helps explain how housing does â€” and doesnâ€™t â€” work in America.<br /><br />Further reading:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Lustron-Home-History-Prefabricated-Experiment/dp/0786426551">https://www.amazon.com/Lustron-Home-History-Prefabricated-Experiment/dp/0786426551</a><br />Tom Fettersâ€™s book, The Lustron Home, is packed full of charts, graphs, original letters, and a clear and concise history of the companyâ€™s successes and failures.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/SUBURBAN-STEEL-MAGNIFICENT-FAILURE-LANDSCAPE/dp/0814252737">https://www.amazon.com/SUBURBAN-STEEL-MAGNIFICENT-FAILURE-LANDSCAPE/dp/0814252737</a><br />Suburban Steel, Douglas Knerrâ€™s look at Lustron, covers similar ground, but with more of an eye toward government drama and the complexities of public funding for a private business.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/exhibits/ohio-history-center-exhibits/1950s-building-the-american-dream/lustron-about/lustron-library/erection-manual">https://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/exhibits/ohio-history-center-exhibits/1950s-building-the-american-dream/lustron-about/lustron-library/erection-manual</a><br />Located in Columbus, the Ohio History Connection has a reconstructed Lustron as an exhibit.
