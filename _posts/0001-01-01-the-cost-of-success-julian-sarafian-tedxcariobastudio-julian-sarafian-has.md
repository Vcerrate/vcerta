{% raw %}Julian Sarafian has it all from the outsider's perspective: the grades, the pedigree, the dream job. But behind the relentless hustling of a high achiever lays a darker path - one of mental health mismanagement, thoughts of self-harm, and the costs behind such great heights. In his Talk, Sarafian discusses the costs of success, and what everyone in the world should think deeper about when it comes to the world of mental health. Julian is a graduate of Berkeley and Harvard Law School who recently left corporate law to advocate for mental health and pursue content creation and entrepreneurship. As someone diagnosed with severe anxiety and mild depression, mental health is an issue close to Julian’s heart – one that he is committed to fighting for in his advocacy work on social media, writing, and upcoming book. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
