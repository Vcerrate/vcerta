{% raw %}MANY AREAS AROUND THE PROVINCES OF DAVAO HAVE FLOODED.<br /><br />It has been non stop raining here at our beach land in Cateel, Davao Oriental.  The past 24 hours, the rain just won't stop, and continued to get heavier!  We kept receiving &quot;orange rainfall warnings&quot;.  This started out as a regular day running errands and working at our beach land... and turned into a very sad day full of  flooding.  Many people around Cateel were evacuated on this day.  <br /><br />I managed to get a quick shot of Kumander Daot's fishpond... it literally looked like it was part of the river.  <br /><br />Rain and floods everywhere in Davao on this day. <br /><br />Let us all hope the rain stops!<br /><br />Power On.<br /><br />*** FOR HAMMOCKS AND SHIRTS JUST MESSAGE VIAJERO OUTDOOR CENTER ON FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://web.facebook.com/viajerocdo/">https://web.facebook.com/viajerocdo/</a><br /><br />*** FOR MORE STORIES AND ADVENTURES CHECK OUT MY FACEBOOK PAGE: #BecomingFilipino{% endraw %}
