Pussy Cat Pussy Cat Nursery Rhyme Lyrics:<br /><br />Pussy cat, pussy cat<br />Where have you been?<br />I've been to London to Visit the Queen.<br /><br />Pussy cat, pussy cat,<br />What did you do there?<br />I frightened a little mouse under her chair.<br /><br />Pussy cat, pussy cat<br />Where did you stay?<br />I stayed in a hotel at Oxford street.<br /><br />Pussy cat, pussy cat<br />What did you eat?<br />I ate scrambled eggs with some cheese.<br /><br />Pussy cat, pussy cat<br />Where did you go?<br />I went to the museum at Marylebone Road.<br /><br />Pussy cat, pussy cat<br />What happened there?<br />Shocked to see the mouse give me a stare.<br /><br />Pussy cat, pussy cat<br />What is your plan?<br />To live in Mayfair with a house and lawn<br /><br />Pussy cat, pussy cat<br />How will you do that?<br />I am gonna marry the queen of cats.<br /><br />============================================<br />Music and Lyrics: Copyright 2016 ChuChu TV™ Studios<br />Video: Copyright 2016 ChuChu TV™ Studios<br />============================================{% endraw %}
