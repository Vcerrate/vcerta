{% raw %}Clean water is a vital resource that we often take for granted, but can’t live without. From basic needs like hydration, cooking, irrigation, and hygiene, to outdoor recreational activities like boating, fishing, and swimming, we rely on clean water to live, work, and play. Many of Pennsylvania’s job-creating industries depend on clean water to make products used here and around the world.  DEP’s Bureau of Clean Water plays a big role in protecting and preserving Pennsylvania’s streams, rivers, and lakes so that all Pennsylvanians can reap the benefits of clean local waters.{% endraw %}
