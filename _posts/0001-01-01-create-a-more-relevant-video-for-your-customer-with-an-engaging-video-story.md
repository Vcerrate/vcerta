She was thrust into the role of storyteller at a very young age when due to an unfortunate birth order mishap she found herself wedged between and academic sister and an adorable scamp of a brother. To stand out, she spent her childhood making up stories… about everything. After a meandering path of unsatisfying careers, Tracy found an outlet for her creative skills in video production. She has spent the past two decades behind the camera in various roles building a solid video background. She found her production happy place was taking scattered and stale ideas and turning them into engaging video scripts while putting her clients at ease on-camera. Two years ago, she left the glamorous world of corporate production to help entrepreneurs captivate and connect with their online audience using video starting Video Script Success. Her clients include Bestselling Authors, CEOs, Key Opinion Leaders, Medical Professionals, Holistic Practitioners and Visionaries. She believes video is not a one-size-fits-all marketing solution. She likes to help entrepreneurs find their video mojo in a fun and engaging way. Her approach to video is bite-sized, non-scary, non-threatening and non-techie.{% endraw %}
