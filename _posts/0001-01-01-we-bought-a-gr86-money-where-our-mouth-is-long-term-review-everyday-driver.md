{% raw %}We bought a 2022 Toyota GR86! After talking about the car since the press launch last year, we decided to buy one and live out our recommendation to buy new enthusiast cars so automakers make more! We ordered Neptune Blue, having never seen it, and arrived at the dealer to see the color for the first time. Join us as we meet the car, unwrap it, and assess it on our initial drive home as well as two weeks later.
