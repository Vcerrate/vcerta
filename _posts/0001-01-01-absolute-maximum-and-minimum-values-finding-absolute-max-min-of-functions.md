{% raw %}In this Calculus video I will show you how to find the absolute maximum and minimum values ( ABSOLUTE EXTREMA ) of a function on a closed interval. <br /><br />The first step is to find critical points. <br /><br />The second step is to evaluate the function at the critical points and at the end points.<br />Finally compare the values to find absolute MAXIMUM and MINIMUM.{% endraw %}
