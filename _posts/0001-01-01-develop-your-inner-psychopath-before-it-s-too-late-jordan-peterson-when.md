{% raw %}When looking at PTSD, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, we find out many things about humans. A huge reason why PTSD is so terrible and life altering is because people experience evil and malevolence. It's hard to wrap one's head around that a human can do terrible things to another human being.
