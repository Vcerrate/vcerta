I know there is so much, that I should try and say, but we lay in bed, and leave it unsaid.  I’m tired of working all night long, trying to fit this world into a song.  I am lazy, I only want to talk about you.  I spend all day with people who don’t think the way you do.  When I’m tired of unravelling all their endless kinds of truth; oh I only want to talk about you.  I am lazy, I only want to talk about love.  What good are words if not to try and and get across, this river that ascends me every time we touch, and to obliterate all this distance I get so tired of. I am tired, I only want to lie beside my lover tonight.  When there is too much midnight to ever express, to listen to his breath, and to lay again my head on his chest.  I am lazy, I only want to talk about love.  Sometimes it feels like the only thing anybody wants me to speak of.  Nobody wants to drag themselves through the endless ruins of all there is in this world that is not love -<br /><br />Follow The Weather Station:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/theweatherstation/">https://www.instagram.com/theweatherstation/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheWeatherStn/">https://www.facebook.com/TheWeatherStn/</a><br /><br />#TheWeatherStation #ToTalkAbout #HowIsItThatIShouldLookAtTheStars{% endraw %}
