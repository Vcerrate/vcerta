{% raw %}In our latest Elder Scrolls video we explore an interesting concept that could be implemented into elder scrolls 6, and if done right could greatly enhanced roleplaying, gameplay diversity and replayability. <br /><br />The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an open world action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series and was released worldwide on November 11, 2011. The game's main story revolves around the player character and their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The videogame is set two hundred years after the events of Oblivion, and takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. <br /><br />MERCH: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/fudgemuppet">https://teespring.com/stores/fudgemuppet</a><br /><br />PATREON: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/fudgemuppet">https://www.patreon.com/fudgemuppet</a><br /><br />SOCIAL MEDIA:<br />Scott: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/NewberryCrunch">https://twitter.com/NewberryCrunch</a><br />Michael: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/OldBerryChew">https://twitter.com/OldBerryChew</a><br />Drew: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DrewBerryMunch">https://twitter.com/DrewBerryMunch</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/fudgemuppets/">http://instagram.com/fudgemuppets/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FudgeMuppet">https://www.facebook.com/FudgeMuppet</a>{% endraw %}
