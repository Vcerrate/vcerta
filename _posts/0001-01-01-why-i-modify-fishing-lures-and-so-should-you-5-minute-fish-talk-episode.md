{% raw %}5 Minute Fish Talk Episode 51<br />Modifying fishing lures is a great way to experiment and find new fishing techniques. As you know, I love making my own fishing lures. With that, I obviously like tinkering with and modifying fishing lures as well. In this video, I talk about why modifying fishing lures could be a great way to grow as an angler, and potentially stumble upon a new technique. <br /><br />As you know, I have been modifying Ned Rigs a good amount over the past year. I would like to find new ways to fish this little bait.
