{% raw %}I wanted to create some long lasting films that aim to capture the magic &amp; soul from the places I visit.   A collection of simple climbing films where the place comes first, the climbing second.   Each film will have its own vibe and tone but hopefully if you've been to these places - they'll connect with you.<br /><br />Watch in 4K with the sound up for full appreciation!<br /><br />I also feel this is a good opportunity to pass on a positive message to others that we need to take care of these amazing places and preserve what we love about them.     <br /><br />With Fontainebleau part 2 on its way next month, I'm also sitting on a ton of footage from other areas too, North Wales &amp; The South West Coast to name a few so do check back for more soon.   <br /><br />Excited to see the next ones develop!   <br /><br />If you liked this film, let me know what you thought &amp; don't forget to like, comment, share &amp; subscribe and stay tuned for the next few ones!   <br /><br /><br />Featured Climbers:  <br /><br />Nic Dove @ndoves<br />Sim Warren @simwarren<br />John Guzek<br /><br />Climbs:<br /><br />01:45 - Katioushka | 7B+ | Bois Du Rocher<br />02:48 - Supplement d'Armes | 7B | Rocher Greau<br />03:56 - Baloo | 7B | Maunoury<br />04:39 - Reve De Pierre | 7A | Rocher Canon Ouest<br />05:54 - Concept | 7A | Apremont Ouest<br />06:25 - Chute De Pierre Assis | 7A+ | Rocher Canon Ouest<br />07:34 - La Mouche | 7B+ | Cuisiniere Crete Sud<br />08:36 - Esthetique | 7B+ | Rocher Cailleau (Not on Bleau info yet)<br /><br />MUSIC:  <br /><br />First track - by Ochre - Tugrul.
