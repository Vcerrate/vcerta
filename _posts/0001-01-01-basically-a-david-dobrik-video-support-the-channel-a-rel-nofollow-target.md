He was the golden child for so long and then was suddenly smothered in drama with Jeff Wittek, Trisha paytas and some really heavy accusations which made the public reaction very different. Phillip Defranco could mention him for 30 seconds in a video, but will gladly slap Dobrik's face on the thumbnail because he KNOWS that giggly little Vine star brings in the VIEWS BABY. We're not here for that though. Really it's just to make basically a David Dobrik video.<br /><br />Deep down though the purpose of the video is to make fun of his laugh. Oh my God that LAUGH. I think Goob did a great job of portraying David Dobrik and I'm sure this is what it's like being his friend. <br /><br />This is entirely satire with no basis in reality. Title was inspired by Matt Colbo's, Basically a Tom Scott video series, watch it here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-IEVMwBEfo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-IEVMwBEfo</a><br /><br />Follow us on socials: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/crackermilk">https://linktr.ee/crackermilk</a><br /><br />Support us on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/crackermilk">https://www.patreon.com/crackermilk</a><br /><br />Buy our MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://crackermilk.myteespring.co/">https://crackermilk.myteespring.co/</a><br /><br />DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discordapp.com/invite/KaN67uP...">https://discordapp.com/invite/KaN67uP...</a><br /><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Crackermilk">https://www.facebook.com/Crackermilk</a><br /><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CrackerMilk">https://twitter.com/CrackerMilk</a><br /><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/crackermilk">https://www.instagram.com/crackermilk</a><br /><br />For business enquiries: connor.crackermilk@gmail.com{% endraw %}
