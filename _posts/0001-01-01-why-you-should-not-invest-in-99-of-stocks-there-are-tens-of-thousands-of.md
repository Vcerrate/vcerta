{% raw %}There are tens of thousands of publicly listed companies in the world so how do you choose which ones you should bother investing in?<br /><br />It's impossible to critically assess every stock, so I have 10 rules I apply to cut out 99% of the companies from consideration before I even bother looking at them in detail.<br /><br />I will go through exactly how I do this with examples and insight - hopefully you find these useful and will be able to apply them to your own investing strategy.<br /><br />There are no hard and fast ways of guaranteeing robust and consistent investing returns, but if I can discard the vast majority of companies outright, I find it pretty helpful to focus my attention on the potential winners.<br /><br />‚òïÔ∏è JOIN MY PATREON - DISCORD, BONUS VIDEOS, TARGET PRICES, MODELS &amp; MORE<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sashayanshin">https://www.patreon.com/sashayanshin</a><br /><br />üíµ GREAT INVESTING APPS I USE<br /><br />SIGN UP FOR ETORO (Global)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://med.etoro.com/B15358_A95689_TClick_SSasha.aspx">https://med.etoro.com/B15358_A95689_TClick_SSasha.aspx</a><br /><br />INTERACTIVE BROKERS (Global)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/interactive-brokers-sasha-yanshin">https://bit.ly/interactive-brokers-sasha-yanshin</a><br /><br />GET $10 IF YOU SIGN UP WITH LIGHTYEAR (UK only)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lightyear.app.link/sasha-yanshin">https://lightyear.app.link/sasha-yanshin</a><br />You need to sign up and make a deposit to get the $10 bonus.<br /><br />GET A FREE SHARE WORTH UP TO $150 WITH STAKE (UK, Australia, NZ)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hellostake.pxf.io/qnA3xq">https://hellostake.pxf.io/qnA3xq</a><br />You will get a free share if you sign up using this link and deposit a minimum of ¬£50.<br /><br />üëç SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SashaYanshin?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/SashaYanshin?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS<br />Introduction - 00:00<br />1.
