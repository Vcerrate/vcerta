{% raw %}We visited The Big Cat Sanctuary in Kent, England to see what it takes to be a big cat keeper. The Big Cat Sanctuary is home to lions, snow leopards, jaguars, and cheetahs. From feeding time to play time, the keepers are kept busy by these beautiful and wild animals.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />#Lions #Cheetahs #INSIDER <br /><br />INSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.
