{% raw %}This week has had one unified theme from @everyone : The update (particularly the Galaxy Tree extension of research) is bad for the players, the game today, and for the long term viability of the game. Three content creators come together, myself, UltimatDJz, and Ripper (via his database) to explain why the math simply doesn't support these new researches and what DJ and I are choosing to do to personally combat it's current iteration. <br /><br />Topics covered:<br /><br />1. Rev &amp; DJz putting their foot down? Oh boy!<br />2. Examples of how the math just doesn't support this tree, at all<br />3. What content creators are personally doing to show their displeasure.<br />4. If you have any game mechanic questions, feel free to drop those questions in the comments!<br /><br />Join the Twitch Family!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/revdeuce">https://www.twitch.tv/revdeuce</a><br /><br />#StarTrekFleetCommand<br />#STFC<br />#getrektm8<br /><br />***********************************<br /><br />Sick merch is here!
