{% raw %}Jordan Peterson is talking about habits that will completely transform you. Watch the video to find out more. If you love these videos, then make sure to subscribe for more amazing content.<br /><br />There are four habits mentioned in the video by Jordan Peterson. These habits if applied can shift your entire life completely. One of my favorite habits is quitting getting drunk on alcohol. This is important because many people drown themselves in alcohol because they are trying to avoid responsibility at all costs. If one can stop drinking alcohol, then one can stop hiding from responsibility. Turn to the video for more!<br /><br />About Jordan Peterson:<br />Jordan Peterson is a renowned speaker, author, former clinical Psychologist, and Professor. He has written three books so far. The first one is The Architecture of Belief, in which Peterson describes a comprehensive theory about how people construct meaning, form beliefs, and make narratives. The book, which took Peterson 13 years to complete, draws concepts from various fields including mythology, religion, literature, philosophy, and psychology, in accordance with the modern scientific understanding of how the brain functions.

Our Goal is to produce compelling inspirational and educational videos that tackle major areas of life such as relationships, self-help and so much more.<br /><br />How we work:<br />This is a channel that is solely aimed at producing self-development videos with the goal of motivating, inspiring, and educating its viewers. The videos we produce have elements like visuals, audio, and background music Which are not owned by us. But thanks to the fair use policy we are able to use clips e.g. from interviews and Jordan Peterson's lectures and transform them by adding commentary in the form of animation and video footage. Here is how we work. Our editors brainstorm video ideas, then analyze hours of interviews and videos across youtube. After finding the clips, we then stitch them together, add music to provide an immersive experience and commentary in form of video footage and whiteboard animation. This commentary helps transform the video to be unique as well as gives the original clips a new perspective. We also add text animations to emphasize important messages in the video.<br /><br />Community:<br />Follow us on Social Media:<br />Discord:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/js7V6beX">https://discord.gg/js7V6beX</a><br />Instagram:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/wiseadvicemotivation.">https://www.instagram.com/wiseadvicemotivation.</a>{% endraw %}
