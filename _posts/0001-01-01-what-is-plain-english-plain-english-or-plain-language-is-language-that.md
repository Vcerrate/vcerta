{% raw %}Plain English or Plain Language is language that is intended to be clear and concise. It attempts to avoid complex vocabulary. It attempts to be free of clich√©s and needless technical jargon, and should be appropriate to the audience's developmental or educational level and their familiarity with the topic. The term is commonly used when discussing government or business communication.<br />Plain English is a way of presenting information that helps your audience understand it the first time they read it and it makes good business sense. Using plain language helps you to communicate well with your clients and customers and give them what they want: information that is accessible and easy to understand.<br />Due to the complexity of legal language, some people advocate that the use of plain English in legal documents should be mandated. At the very least, the legal profession should try its best to use plain language when conveying information in the courts, to the public and in legal documents. All writing, whether legal, medical or political, should easily be accessible by members of society. <br /><br />Follow us on Instagram for more information: @englishexpress_au :){% endraw %}
