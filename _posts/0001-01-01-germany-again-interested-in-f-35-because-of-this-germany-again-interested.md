{% raw %}Germany Again Interested In F 35 Because Of This...... The rejected stealth fighter #F35 as a possible option to replace the German Tornado may return to the race for the #GermanAirForce, BulgarianMilitary.com has learned, citing information from the German news agency DPA. The reason is 20 B-61 nuclear bombs, which were given by the United States to Germany under the NATO “Nuclear Sharing” program. @FORCE Technology{% endraw %}
