He works really closely with me (Cole) on the videos and he deserves a ton of credit! Follow his Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JariVFX">https://twitter.com/JariVFX</a><br /><br />My name is Cole and I run this channel solo! I started this channel alongside my bro, Josh but he has a fulltime job keeping him busy. Keeping the name RodeyBros despite the channel being run solely by me because I think it's a dope name lol I like to think all of you are apart of the bros anyways, so let's keep growin this thing.<br /> - Cole<br /><br />#FortniteSeason7 #RodeyBros{% endraw %}
