{% raw %}Have you ever been wondering: &quot;Which rod action do I need?&quot; Or, how to pick the right rod action? &quot;Do I need a fast or moderate fast spinning rod?&quot; The new Sustain models are Shimano's new, top-end versatile spinning rods with both fast and moderate fast action rods within the range. Bart Jan explains when and how to choose for a fast action rod, and when to choose a moderate fast action rod. Different Rod actions explained! <br /><br />The spinning rod models with extra-fast actions cast superbly and have sensitive tips combined with a powerful middle, making them perfect for both long range hardbaits for pike or Sea bass and also jigs and softbaits for zander and perch. The spinning rods within the SUSTAIN range with moderate-fast actions are more suited to crankbait fishing, are a little easier to cast when using smaller lures and benefit from a semi-parabolic playing action that will give you the confidence to pile on the pressure when required.There are also two very special Baitcasting options that are simply breathtaking.<br /><br />Sustain - any time, any place, anywhere.   <br /><br />Find out all details of the Sustain rods here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fish.shimano-eu.com/content/fish/eu/gb/en/homepage/News/Sustain-Spinning-Rod.html">https://fish.shimano-eu.com/content/fish/eu/gb/en/homepage/News/Sustain-Spinning-Rod.html</a><br /><br />Follow Shimano Europe on FACEBOOK:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ShimanoPredatorEU/">https://www.facebook.com/ShimanoPredatorEU/</a><br />Follow Shimano Europe on INSTAGRAM:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shimano_predator/">https://www.instagram.com/shimano_predator/</a><br />#Shimano #RodActions #SpinningRod{% endraw %}
