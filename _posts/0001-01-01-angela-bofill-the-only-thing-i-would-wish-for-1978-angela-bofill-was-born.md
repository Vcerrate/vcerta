{% raw %}Angela Bofill was born to a white Cuban father and a black Afro-Latino Puerto Rican mother.[1] She performed with Ricardo Marrero &amp; the Group and Dance Theater of Harlem chorus prior to being introduced to Dave Grusin and Larry Rosen (of the jazz label GRP Records) by her friend, the jazz flautist Dave Valentin.[2] Grusin and Rosen signed Bofill and produced her first album, Angie, in 1978. Angie was well received both critically and commercially and included the chart single &quot;This Time I'll Be Sweeter&quot; (co-written by Gwen Guthrie), as well as Bofill's sprawling jazz composition, &quot;Under the Moon and Over the Sky&quot;. Less than a year later, a second album, Angel of the Night was released and outperformed its predecessor. The album included the chart singles &quot;What I Wouldn't Do (For the Love of You)&quot; and the up tempo title track, as well as the self-written song &quot;I Try&quot; (covered by Will Downing in 1991). The reception of these albums positioned Bofill as one of the first Latina singers to find success in the R&amp;B and jazz markets<br /><br />&quot;Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
