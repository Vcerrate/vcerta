{% raw %}This is a video that I produced while working for the WIA Summer Youth program in 2014. <br />In this program, I was a part of the Digital Media Technology Stationary crew. We called ourselves Inside Out Media and were in charge of all the media coverage of the program including taking pictures, creating the yearbook, and creating other designs for the program.{% endraw %}
