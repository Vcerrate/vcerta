These aren't redesigning minecraft bosses or redesigning minecraft mobs like I usually do, because these minecraft mobs were never added to the game. FitMC did a really cool video that inspired me to make this one. These projects are a lot of fun so I hope you enjoyed!<br /><br />//about<br />My name's daniel and I design things. Usually I do 3d modeling in blender but I'm now a metal worker thanks to mr beast apparently??? Who knows what I'll design in the future. If you have any ideas please let me know{% endraw %}
