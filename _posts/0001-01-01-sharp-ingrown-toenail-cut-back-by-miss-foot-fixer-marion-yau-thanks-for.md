{% raw %}Thanks for watching the video and please show some support and subscribe to my channel.<br /><br />In this video Miss Foot Fixer Marion Yau will be cutting back a sharp piece of nail. I  make it look very easy because I can see. Sometimes the nail does not have to be very ingrown to hurt but sometimes it just a sharp <br />piece of nail that can cause some irritation. By cutting it back, it can relieve the pressure. Here I trim of the skin as that can add pressure to the toe. <br /><br />I hope everyone stay safe and let's stay in so that we can fight this virus and get back to work or myself treating some feet. <br /><br />Miss Foot Fixer AKA Marion Yau <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you for watching the video.<br />Please SUBSCRIBE to our channel for more videos and don't forget to write a comment and like this video. <br /><br /><br />For more content or an appointment please visit us at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.footcliniclondon.co.uk">https://www.footcliniclondon.co.uk</a> 020 3150 1655<br /><br />My clinic treats the following, corn, calluses, nail fungus, ingrown toenails, distorted nails, verruca, warts, nail laser treatment, wart laser treatment.<br /><br />To book an appointment please go to this link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=11187952/">https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=11187952/</a><br /><br />Please Like your Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/missfootfixer">https://www.facebook.com/missfootfixer</a><br />Follow us on Instagram for short videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/missfootfixer">https://www.instagram.com/missfootfixer</a><br />If you are bored and have nothing to do subscribe to my channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbNaXujN82HIuNxynYiCnvw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbNaXujN82HIuNxynYiCnvw</a><br />Miss Foot Fixer Marion Yau<br />Disclaimer:<br />This video may contain podiatric surgical and/or procedural content.
