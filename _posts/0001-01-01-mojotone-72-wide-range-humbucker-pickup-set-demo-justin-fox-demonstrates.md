{% raw %}Justin Fox demonstrates the tonality of Mojotone's '72 Wide Range Humbucker Pickup Set.  The demo features clean and driven tones for each of the pickup positions, as well as a heavy drive demonstration on the bridge pickup.<br /><br />Most are not aware of the differences between the original Wide Range humbucker from the 70's and the reissue version of today. The main difference is the magnet structure. The original Wide Range humbucker used actual threaded magnets straight through the bobbins whereas the reissue version uses threaded steel poles that are magnetized by a bar magnet across the bottom. The result of the reissue Wide Range is a much darker sounding humbucker with less chime, focus and clarity as compared to the original. <br /><br />The Mojotone '72 Wide Range clone humbucker completely captures that original sound with some overall improvements from the original design like a slightly underwound neck pickup for a more balanced neck to bridge pickup tone, and 4-conductor wiring for more tone options such as coil tapping and series/parallel wiring. Fully vacuum potted. Available in Chrome only with mounting hardware. 500k pots recommended. Does not fit standard humbucker routes because of the larger original size.<br /><br />Visit the link for more info: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mojotone.com/Mojotone-72-Clone-Wide-Range-Humbucker-Pickup">https://www.mojotone.com/Mojotone-72-Clone-Wide-Range-Humbucker-Pickup</a><br /><br />Timecodes: <br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:11 - Neck Pickup / Clean<br />00:51 - Neck Pickup / Drive<br />01:30 - Neck &amp; Bridge Pickup / Clean<br />01:56 - Neck &amp; Bridge Pickup / Drive<br />02:25 - Bridge Pickup / Clean<br />03:01 - Bridge Pickup / Drive<br />03:39 - Neck Pickup / Heavy Drive{% endraw %}
