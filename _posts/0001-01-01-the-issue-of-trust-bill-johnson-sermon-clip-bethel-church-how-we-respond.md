{% raw %}How we respond in difficult times reveals where our trust lies. In this sermon clip, Bill Johnson teaches on the importance of taking every thought captive, and how to take down negative strongholds in our hearts and minds. As we choose trust in God and let those strongholds be pulled down, we will experience new levels of authority in prayer and be people who can bring hope and freedom to others.<br /><br />This is an excerpt from Bill's message “Choose Your Stronghold”.
