{% raw %}I've spent a seriously sad amount of time looking at Aerial views of my country on google earth. Playing this map was about as obvious a thing to do as it gets. <br />Last week the world capitals definitely tested me, but ultimately there were enough geographical features and variety to discern the country. In the broadly unvarying landscape of Britain however, was there a chance I could be stumped?<br /><br />PLAY ALONG: Play your round, put your marker down, then switch tabs back to Youtube to watch my attempt and the result. This way you don't ruin the game or the video!<br /><br />Here's the link to the map.. *DISCLAIMER* In order to get this working, you need to download the script, and for the script to work you need to have downloaded tamper monkey or something similar. It's easy, and I'm sure the source is trustworthy, but download at your own risk..<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.geoguessr.com/challenge/ieZuvyDsSyAyQVYF">https://www.geoguessr.com/challenge/ieZuvyDsSyAyQVYF</a><br /><br />The instructions are in the map's description.{% endraw %}
