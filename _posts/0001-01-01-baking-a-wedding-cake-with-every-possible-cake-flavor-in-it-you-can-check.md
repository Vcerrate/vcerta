{% raw %}You can check out our Colourpop frankenlipsticks here! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://colourpop.com/collections/safiya-nygaard-makeup">https://colourpop.com/collections/safiya-nygaard-makeup</a><br /><br />And now I present to you, part 2 of our 4-part wedding series! We had to make a franken-wedding-something, so why not a cake? We decided to bake an 8-tier wedding cake where each layer is a different cake flavor, and then at the end taste them as tiers and all together. What do you guys think? Do you want a franken-cake at your wedding? Should we keep doing bad culinary science or retire our spatulas for good?<br /><br />Thank you so much to Rosanna Pansino for helping us bake our cake!
