{% raw %}Sofía Vergara somehow keeps getting caught by paparazzi while she’s eating, but the good news is that she has a special technique for eating and not messing up her makeup. The Emmy-nominated actress also chatted with Ellen about her dog Bubbles loving husband Joe Manganiello more than her, explained that she has no idea why she modelled on top of a big high heel when she was younger, and talked about the new season of “America’s Got Talent”.<br /><br />#SofiaVergara<br />#TheEllenShow<br />#Ellen{% endraw %}
