{% raw %}Germany intends to transfer 100 Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled howitzers to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.<br /><br />The German military-industrial company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann is going to put 1000 Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled artillery mounts into service with Ukraine. The latter are capable of delivering powerful strikes with 155-mm ammunition. at distances up to 56 kilometers, which is a rather impressive threat.<br /><br />“Ukraine needs long-range weapons to strike in various directions. The Bundeswehr will supply 100 self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine and replace them in its arsenal. Germany could pose a far greater threat than previously known. The military industry offers Kiev 100 self-propelled howitzers. This proposal from Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) was sent to the Federal Ministry of Economics on Saturday morning by Ukraine at the working level”, - reports the publication &quot;Die Welt&quot;.<br /><br />We are actually talking about the supply of offensive weapons, although before that Germany categorically denied its intentions to take such steps and provide Ukraine with any weapons other than defensive ones.<br /><br />According to preliminary estimates, we are talking about the sale of howitzers to Ukraine, at the same time. The amount of the contract can be estimated from 1,7 billion euros, in connection with which there are a number of questions whether Ukraine will be able to pay for the supply of such weapons.<br /><br />To date, Germany is armed with more than 120 Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled guns, which means that if the transfer of these weapons to Ukraine takes place, then Ukraine will become the largest owner of German artillery.{% endraw %}
