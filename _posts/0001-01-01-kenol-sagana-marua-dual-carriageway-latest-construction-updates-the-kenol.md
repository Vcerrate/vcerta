{% raw %}The Kenol - Kagana - Marua Highway improvement Project is part of the Kenyan section of Trans-Africa Highway, TAH4 (Cairo to Cape), through Nairobi on to Moyale. The project road also links the Capital City Nairobi to some of the major commercially and agriculturally rich Mt Kenya region as well as to Ethiopia through the Moyale border. Thus, it will contribute to enhancing movement of goods/ services (trade) and people between the counties in Central, Eastern Kenya and the capital city, Nairobi and also links with Ethiopia. The Project consists of the dualling of 84 km of the Kenol–Sagana–Marua road with grade separated junctions, road safety interventions and social complementary initiatives. The project also includes soft components such as training of unemployed youth, institutional capacity building, monitoring and evaluation, sensitization and awareness, tree planting, among others. The total cost of the project is EUR 257.68 million. The Project is co-financed by the Bank Group (69%), Africa Growing Together Fund (12%) and Government of Kenya (19%). The overall implementation period is 5 years (2020–2025).{% endraw %}
