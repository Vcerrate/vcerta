{% raw %}In this Skylapser video, we show you how to calculate the Field of View (FOV) for any camera, or any lens. For shooting panoramic or giga-pixel photos, it’s necessary to know both the horizontal and the vertical FOV for the particular lens that you are using. Most sites only show you the Diagonal FOV for a full frame 35mm camera. There are exceptions such as Max Lyon’s Photography Calculator page here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.tawbaware.com/maxlyons/calc.htm">http://www.tawbaware.com/maxlyons/calc.htm</a><br />But another way to calculate FOV is by using the following formula:<br />2x arctan(Sensor mm/2/(Lens mm))in deg<br />You can copy or type this formula into Google search and substitute the values for your camera’s sensor dimensions and your lens focal length and it will calculate your FOV value.<br />Be sure to check out <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://skylapser.com">http://skylapser.com</a> for more tips, techniques, and tutorials.{% endraw %}
