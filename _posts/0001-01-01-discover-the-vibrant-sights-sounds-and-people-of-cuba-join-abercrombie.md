{% raw %}Join Abercrombie &amp; Kent for an unforgettable journey to Cuba designed to reveal the spirit of this fascinating, culturally-rich island. Travel with a small group of no more than 24 guests from Havana to Cienfuegos, Caibarién and Santa Clara, with a visit to the eco-community of Las Terrazas. The 10-day journey will immerse you in Cuban culture, exploring its rich arts tradition, vibrant culture and delicious cuisine during educational exchanges with local residents.<br /><br />Uncover the Havana only long-time residents know by exploring the city on foot with a local architect. Dine at a paladar (family-run restaurant) where the owners share their passion for Cuban cuisine. Gain a deeper understanding of the island’s cultural traditions through its art, music and pastimes. Engage with local musicians during a private Buena Vista Social Club-style concert and cultural discussion. Partake in a private salsa lesson and listen to a cappella choral performance. Discover our shared passion for baseball at a game with Cuban players, and even play a few innings with them.<br /><br />For dates and prices for Cuba: People to People: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.abercrombiekent.com/travel/?tid=6763">http://www.abercrombiekent.com/travel/?tid=6763</a> <br /><br />Learn more about travel to Cuba with Abercrombie &amp; Kent: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.abercrombiekent.com/travel-destinations/cuba/">http://www.abercrombiekent.com/travel-destinations/cuba/</a><br /><br />www.abercrombiekent.com{% endraw %}
