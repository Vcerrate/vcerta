{% raw %}Hello, this is my third comparison.<br />A Comparison beyond our own universe! From the Observable Universe to the Box and Infinity, most of these are unofficial or don’t have any size. The zooming out is similar to Cary’s Scale Past the Universe, only difference is that there aren’t any circle things, since they would be too hard to make, and second there are more stuff. This also inspires lots of stuff from the Verse and Dimensions Wiki, like the Ultraverse, The Barrel (Which turned out horrible in the video), and much more. Some sizes are altered, like the Multiverse starting at 4 Septillion Light Years and every Archverse being 1000 times bigger than the last.<br /><br />The music in this video:<br />Let’s Go! - Lensko<br />Hellcat - Desmeon<br />At the Speed of Light - Dimrain47<br /><br />Enjoy!{% endraw %}
