Being curios I wanted to reach my thinking to know if is exactly what I am thinking, this man is very good and he is around 45 years. Seriously he never asked of what I am thinking but because of his communication to me I fell in love with him and when I ask for anything, he does not delay. But I later found that he is married yet this man has never asked me of what I am thinking. Now I am the one who want to see him again and again, one day I called him and he told me I should not call him again because his wife doesn’t like that.
