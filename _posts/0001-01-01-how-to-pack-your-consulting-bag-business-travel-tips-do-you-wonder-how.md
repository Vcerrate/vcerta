{% raw %}Do you wonder how to pack your consulting bag? In this video I share business travel tips, focusing on the cabin luggage that consultants will usually carry around for their weekly travel. In a regular work week, consultants travel to the client on Monday and come back home Thursday evening. This requires a well packed consulting bag. In this video, I share my tips from having worked as a consultant at different firms. I hold that these tips are valid for all MBB consulting firms such as McKinsey, BCG and Bain, but also other firms such as Big 4 consulting firms as well. Watch this video for crucial business travel tips and consulting travel tips. Traveling for work is a key part of consulting life, especially before the current health situation. I show you what is in my bag based on my old consulting routine. Packing your bag is a key part of every consulting day in the life!
