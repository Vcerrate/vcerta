{% raw %}Forensic entomologists study the insects found on a corpse to determine the time and cause of death, providing crucial evidence.<br /><br />Forensic scientists work with a variety of methods (i.e. computer technology, anthropology, entomology) to solve crimes which would otherwise remain unsolved, through finding seemingly obscure clues such as tire tracks, bullet fragments and hair samples and then putting the pieces together. Interviews with forensic pathologists, cold case detectives and victims families show the process entailed in each case. Three separate cases are spotlighted in each episode of this series.<br /><br />Content licensed from New Dominion Pictures to Little Dot Studios.<br /><br />Any queries, please contact us at: owned-enquiries@littledotstudios.com<br /><br />#TheNewDetectives #RealResponders{% endraw %}
