{% raw %}Edmund Kemper was born in Burbank, California in December of 1948. Nine years later, his parents divorced, and he moved with his two sisters and mother to my home state of Montana. However, his relationship with his spiraling alcoholic mother was what he attributed to being the source of many of his issues. He began to display troubling patterns early.<br /><br />He admitted to regularly fantasizing about killing his mother, however, disturbing behavior quickly intensified. He would act out brutal and fatal rites with his sisters’ dolls and had his sisters act out grim scenarios involving his own torture and death, but it wasn’t long until he escalated again. At the age of 10, he killed one of his family cats by burying it alive, and 3 years later he slaughtered the second with a knife. Shortly thereafter, he ran away from his mother to his father, but it wasn’t long before he was sent to his grandparents’ farm. The next three years of his life would be fueled by hatred for his time there.<br /><br />It would come to a head in August of 1964 when he shot and killed his grandmother in their kitchen after an argument. Later, when his grandfather arrived home from work, he killed him while by his car and hid the body. He then called his mother and she instructed him to tell the police. Later when speaking to law enforcement he said that he had killed his grandmother “to see what it felt like,” but had killed his grandfather so he wouldn’t have to face his grandfather’s response after finding out what had been done.<br /><br />He was handed over to the California Youth Authority and underwent a variety of tests. They determined that he was not only of above-average intelligence but that he also suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. He was eventually sent to a maximum-security facility for mentally ill convicts. There he would display exemplary behavior, which earned him various privileges in prison.<br /><br />When he was released in 1969, he rejoined his mother despite the prison doctor’s concerns regarding past abuse and various attributed psychological issues. Sure enough within the next three years, his behavior would take another horrific turn. He would begin picking up female hitchhikers and letting them go, while, unbeknownst to them, his car would be fully stocked with various objects he needed for murder. Then, in 1972 he would begin a brutal killing spree. From August of 1972 to April of 1973 he would kill 6 different women and would carry out various brutal, upsetting, and explicit acts with their remains.<br /><br />On the night of April 20th, 1973, Kemper would carry out the first of his final two murders. After his mother had come home from a party and fallen asleep, he went into her room, murdered her, and performed extremely troubling acts to her remains. He then stored the body, went to a bar for a quick drink, and returned home to invite his mother’s close friend over to watch a movie. Upon her arrival, he strangled her as well to create a cover story for his mother’s absence which involved the two friends going away on a vacation. He then cleaned up the scene, left a note for the police he was sure was going to be there soon, and fled over 1,000 miles to Pueblo, CO.<br /><br />However, upon not hearing any news of his crimes on the radio, he called in twice to law enforcement to confess. After being blown off with the first call, he then contacted an officer he knew and confessed to everything. When asked in a later interview as to why he chose to turn himself in, he responded,<br /><br />“The original purpose was gone…It wasn't serving any physical or real or emotional purpose. It was just a pure waste of time ... Emotionally, I couldn't handle it much longer. Toward the end there, I started feeling the folly of the whole damn thing, and at the point of near exhaustion, near collapse, I just said to hell with it and called it all off.&quot;<br /><br />Save Money on Your College Degree<br />Observe is partnered with the Emotional Intelligence Academy in the UK to offer discounts of 10%-50% on your education including a fully accredited Master's Degree!
