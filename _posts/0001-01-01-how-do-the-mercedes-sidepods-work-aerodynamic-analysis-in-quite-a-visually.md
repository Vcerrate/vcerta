{% raw %}In quite a visually apparent update to the car, Mercedes has brought quite a radical change in sidepod concept to the W13. They have essentially created a large downwashing wing with a shroud around the side impact structure, and then have inverted the sidepod inlet and put it towards the floor. This seems to be in an attempt to get more downwash and stronger vortices from the top of the sidepod, but the legalities are certainly interesting!<br /><br />00:00 Introduction<br />02:33 Mirror Legality<br />05:01 Sidepod Legality<br />09:33 Sidepod Aerodynamic Benefits<br />13:35 Sidepod Aerodynamic Drawbacks<br /><br />Aero courses: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://courses.jkfaero.com">https://courses.jkfaero.com</a><br />Race car consulting: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.jkfaero.com">http://www.jkfaero.com</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Kyleengineers">https://www.facebook.com/Kyleengineers</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/KYLEDRIVES">https://www.patreon.com/KYLEDRIVES</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kyleengineers/">https://www.instagram.com/kyleengineers/</a><br />Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Kyleengi...">https://www.youtube.com/user/Kyleengi...</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/KyleEngineers">https://twitter.com/KyleEngineers</a>{% endraw %}
