{% raw %}Fiber cement boards have become quite common in the construction industry. <br />Typical cement fibre board is made of cement, fillers / wood, cellulose and silica.<br />Now cement board houses and other kinds of FC board buildings are harder to identify because the fiber cement boards available in market now have highly advanced texture and colors that mimics wood, aluminum etc. <br />Natural wood has an elegant appeal, but it is more susceptible to damage from the elements, especially fire. Fiber cement/ hardie/ v board siding, on the other hand, is fire-resistant, durable, and affordable.<br />If you planned to use fibre cement board instead of brick work for your walls, then thats a good option.<br />Although the product has been around since the 1970s, modern manufacturing methods have increased the availability as well as the style choices available to homeowners. The product has seen massive appeal not only for the homeowners who get to look at it everyday, but also the builders and contractors who are sourcing materials, doing bidding, and actually installing the product.<br />Cement boards are used because when compared to gypsum boards, they stand strong in the presence of moisture and leaks. Cement boards have excellent moisture absorbing and drying properties making them resistant to weather change as well.<br /><br />To instantly view good quality videos related to sustainable living, nature, energy and climate change, subscribe to Eco snooki now.<br />Follow us on Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ecosnooki/">https://www.instagram.com/ecosnooki/</a><br />Follow us on Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ecosnooki/">https://www.facebook.com/ecosnooki/</a>{% endraw %}
