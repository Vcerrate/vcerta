Applying for job after job and not getting any interviews?   Perhaps you’ve gotten a few interviews but always seem to get passed over for the job?   Or maybe you’re not satisfied with your current career and want a change.  Well you’ve come to the right place.   <br /> <br />As a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience hiring thousands of employees at all levels into major corporations, I’m going to spill the beans on how to get noticed by recruiters, start getting more interviews, navigate through each step of the hiring process and ultimately land the dream job you deserve.   <br /> <br />But that’s not all - I firmly believe that in order to truly experience career success, you need to think bigger.   Multiple streams of income and budgeting are crucial to forming a layoff-free lifestyle and helping you achieve your goals.    <br /> <br />If these are things you’re struggling with, that’s what I specialize in.   I’ve got a website called A Life After Layoff.   It’s loaded with tips and tricks on how to get noticed, interviewed and hired by your dream company.
