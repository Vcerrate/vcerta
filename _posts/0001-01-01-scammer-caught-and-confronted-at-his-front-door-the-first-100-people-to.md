Not only are we going to confront him, but we’re gonna have $15,000 of cash hanging out of the package and are gonna see what he has to say for it. The cash is fake, but the scam is very real. <br /><br />How did we get here? It’s all thanks to our brother Jaani in India. He's gone undercover as a pretend Amazon refund scammer. You’re about to hear a phone call between him and a scammer boss in India, a boss that runs his own scam call centers, and has multiple money mules all over the United States accepting cash payments from victims. We have tons of videos on our channel explaining this scam in detail, but it involves a fake Amazon representative convincing a victim that their account has been over refunded, forcing them to send large amounts of money to rectify it. <br /><br />This money is sent to what’s called a money mule, whose job it is to collect this money, take a percentage, and launder the rest back to the boss overseas. The mule can be anybody. It can be your grandmother, who’s been manipulated into it thinking she’s doing the right thing, or it can be dangerous criminals who know exactly the kind of fraud they’re facilitating. <br /><br />Jaani is pretending to be a scam boss. He’s on the phone with this real scam boss named Ankit. Ankit has instructed Jaani to have his victim send money to a man named Thomy in Sacramento. Jaani sends the info to us, we send a real package, overnight, so there’s a valid tracking number to show, and then we show up with our decoy package and confront the recipient face to face. <br /><br />Ankit spends a great deal of time explaining to Jaani that he’s trustworthy and wants to do business long term. He has even gone as far as to send Jaani video recordings of previous packages being laundered. <br /><br />This happens every day, and it’s sickening. The man we’re about to confront, Thomy, is a mule that Amit claims has been working for him for almost a decade. So we’ve got some questions for Thomy, so we’re heading up there right now to get answers.<br /><br />Stream TRILOGY+ 7 Days for FREE!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://trilogyplus.com">https://trilogyplus.com</a><br /><br />SUPPORT JAANI DIRECTLY ON PAYPAL: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/JaaniMuxikk">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/JaaniMuxikk</a><br /><br />SUPPORT TRILOGY MEDIA DIRECTLY ON PAYPAL: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/trilogymediainc">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/trilogymediainc</a><br /><br />💚 Become a Member 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ooTPVZ">https://bit.ly/3ooTPVZ</a><br />💙 Become a Facebook Supporter 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2I6Yuw6">https://bit.ly/2I6Yuw6</a><br />💜 Support Us on Patreon 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/trilogymedia">https://www.patreon.com/trilogymedia</a><br /><br />🎥 Stream Trilogy+ 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.trilogyplus.com">https://www.trilogyplus.com</a><br />💻 Multi-Visions 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://multi-visions.com/">http://multi-visions.com/</a><br />👚 Get Some Merch  👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.trilogymedia.com">https://shop.trilogymedia.com</a><br />🌐 Visit Our Website 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.trilogymedia.com">https://www.trilogymedia.com</a><br />📅 Live Stream Calendar 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.trilogymedia.com/calendar">https://www.trilogymedia.com/calendar</a><br /><br />Instagram 👉  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trilogymediainc/">https://www.instagram.com/trilogymediainc/</a><br />Facebook  👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/trilogymediainc">https://www.facebook.com/trilogymediainc</a><br />Twitter 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/trilogymediainc">https://www.twitter.com/trilogymediainc</a><br />TikTok 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@trilogymediainc">https://www.tiktok.com/@trilogymediainc</a><br /><br />*Videos are for entertainment purposes only.
