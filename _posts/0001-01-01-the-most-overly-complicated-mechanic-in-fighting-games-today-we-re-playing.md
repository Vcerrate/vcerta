{% raw %}Today we're playing some more Persona 4 Arena: Ultimax! Today we're discussing Junpei, the character with THE MOST ridiculously complicated unique mechanic I've personally seen in a fighting game. His baseball gauge and it's associated Victory Cry mode are REALLY hard to understand, especially if you don't know the rules of baseball. We'll be discussing how Junpei works, some of his basic combos and supers, including how to get 10 runs in one combo! And then taking him online to see how we far with Shadow Junpei! Hope you enjoy the video! <br /><br />Twitch (I stream every weekday from 5-8 EST): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/jmcrofts">https://www.twitch.tv/jmcrofts</a><br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/jmcrofts">https://www.patreon.com/jmcrofts</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/crofts">https://twitter.com/crofts</a>{% endraw %}
