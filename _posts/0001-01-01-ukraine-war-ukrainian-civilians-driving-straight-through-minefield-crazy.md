{% raw %}Crazy video footage from Ukraine shows Ukrainian civilians driving straight through an anti-tank minefield in the middle of a road.<br /><br />Several cars carefully navigated through the mines one after another trying to evade the explosives.<br /><br />The mines appears to have been M-62M anti-tank blast mines armed with a 7.5 kg explosive charge and an operating pressure of 150+ kg.<br /><br />Luckily the mines were not magnetic.<br /><br />There are unconfirmed reports that the mines got placed by retreating Russian forces in the area of Kyiv but we can not say for sure.<br /><br />WarLeaks - Military Blog covers events, news, missions &amp; facts from the United States Armed Forces including the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy,  U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard and more!
