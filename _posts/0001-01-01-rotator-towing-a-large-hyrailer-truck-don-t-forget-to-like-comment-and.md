We have a lot of things coming up and moving forward that you won't want to miss!!!<br /><br />Hello Ladies &amp; Gentlemen and as always, thank you for watching.  Today,  I show using our Peterbilt 389X with a Miller Industries, Century 1150R, towing &amp; recovery unit #11, towing a large hyrail equipped truck to our shop from its breakdown location.   This is a typical job for me, but, I understand that a lot of people are curious about the hyrail systems.  The hyrails are the equipment on the vehicle that allow it to travel on the railroad tracks.   If not towed properly, the hyrails can be damaged and THAT can be expensive.  I hope you all enjoy this video!!!   Thanks for watching and God bless!!! <br /><br />My common analogy, &quot;there are many ways to reach 10&quot;.   I could have approached this (any)  job several different ways.  The approach method is important, but more important is achieving the desired result, safely.<br /><br /><br />Went back to my traditional intro for now.   The new Intro didn't go over very well.   I appreciate everyone's input.    Thanks again and God bless.<br /><br />Again, a very special thank you to all my viewers, family, and friends who having taken the time to show their support.  May God bless and protect you all!!!   <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/RotatorRon">https://www.paypal.me/RotatorRon</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.guardianangeldevices.com/m/towtruck-safety-light/?code=122">https://www.guardianangeldevices.com/m/towtruck-safety-light/?code=122</a> Follow the link for special pricing on the Guardian Angel Elite seen in this video.
