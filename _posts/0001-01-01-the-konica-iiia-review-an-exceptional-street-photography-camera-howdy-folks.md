{% raw %}Howdy folks! This week I talk about my photographic engagement with the wonderful Konica IIIA. It's an incredibly well thought through camera that is best at home in the streets and for casual documenting of your life. Speaking of documenting, the Konica IIIA is exceptionally well suited for documentation style shooting out in the field. Due to its frame lines which not only adjust parallax error but also for the image circle which slightly changes when the lens moves in and out, in order to focus, this wonderful 35mm camera is also well suited for portraits out in the streets.<br />Now, is this the ultimate camera for me? Out on the streets, yes. But as you guys know, I love SLRs and to me they still have a bit more value when it comes to purely being a tool for the photography I love shooting best, portraiture. The Konica IIIA is amazing, the results are stellar...but it is just one tool in my line-up of photography gear.{% endraw %}
