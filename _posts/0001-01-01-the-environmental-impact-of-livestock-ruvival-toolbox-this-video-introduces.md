The life cycle of livestock also requires large amounts of water and has a severe impact on the atmosphere of our planet. If not properly managed, livestock production could cripple the life supporting systems of our biosphere and all other living beings sharing our planet.<br /><br />RUVIVAL - Sustainable Rural Development and highly productive New Towns is concerned with restoring degraded areas and creating new not just inhabitable, but liveable spaces. It is an e-learning project of the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) in cooperation with the Hamburg Open Online University (HOOU).<br /><br />The Environmental Impact of Livestock by Alvaro Rigel Gallegos Rivero and Ruth Schaldach <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/VGJduwENNw4">https://youtu.be/VGJduwENNw4</a> is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0.">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0.</a>{% endraw %}
