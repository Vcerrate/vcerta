{% raw %}For a bit of post-festive fun, I am looking at the recently published Hagerty Bull Market List. Made with Carfection (thumbnail photo by the fabulous Dean Smith) this is a list of ten cars they feel are &quot;safe buys&quot; for 2022 - with the possibility you might even earn a few quid!<br /><br />However, I think they've made a few unusual calls- so here's my take on the list, and my own &quot;Hot tips of 2022&quot;*<br /><br />The original article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hagerty.co.uk/articles/market-analysis/2022-bull-market-list-10-of-britains-hottest-collectable-cars/">https://www.hagerty.co.uk/articles/market-analysis/2022-bull-market-list-10-of-britains-hottest-collectable-cars/</a><br /><br />*Hot tips are not sound financial advice<br /><br />Want to see your car on the channel?
