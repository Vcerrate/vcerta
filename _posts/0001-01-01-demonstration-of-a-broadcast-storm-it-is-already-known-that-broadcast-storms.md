{% raw %}It is already known that broadcast storms can bring down a network to its knee. One of the prevention mechanisms to avoid broadcast storms is STP (Spanning Tree Protocol). By default, most networking switches have STP enabled and configured. However, by disabling STP on 2 interconnected switches with redundant links, we can actually start a broadcast storm intentionally.{% endraw %}
