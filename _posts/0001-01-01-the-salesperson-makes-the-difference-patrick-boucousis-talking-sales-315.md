{% raw %}What really wins us the order? <br />What makes the difference between winning and losing?<br /><br />Is it brand, product or price?<br /><br />In fact Research has shown that, in complex business decision-making, what influenced B2B buyers most, was the sales experience, the interactions with the seller, i.e. the salesperson.<br /><br />This was more so than company, product, brand, price or quality. Of course, we need those to qualify to be considered. As Cian McLouglin says, you need these to get on the dance floor, but it's invariable not what wins. It's about providing the customer with a superior experience throughout their buying journey.<br /><br />In this short video discussion Patrick Boucousis tells me that a lot of us have lost sight of this. <br /><br />So if our competitive edge is our salesperson then what are we doing to help our salesperson  provide a better experience for the customer?<br /><br />Patrick makes some interesting observations and recommendations in this 6 minute discussion.<br /><br />What was the difference in the last sale you won?{% endraw %}
