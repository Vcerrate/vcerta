{% raw %}A video about two Israeli lads exploring Athens, Greece. We met an awesome Polish beggar, people tried to scam us with fake/overpriced perfume, saw some beautiful ruins and tried some delectable Greek cuisine. I decided to throw in a bit more humor than usual in this one because me and Shahar always like to joke around when we're together anyway, so please don't take it too seriously.<br />Support the channel on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thesalukie">https://www.patreon.com/thesalukie</a><br />Follow on IG live updates: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thesalukie/">https://www.instagram.com/thesalukie/</a>{% endraw %}
