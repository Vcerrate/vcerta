{% raw %}Check out Richard Permin's latest video: rooftop freestyle skiing in Avoriaz 1800, France.<br /><br />Certain days can be really original… They depend on where you live and what you do! Richard Permin’s everyday life for instance is definitely out of the ordinary.<br />In Good Morning, his latest video project, Richard endlessly repeats his morning routine. Right after getting out of bed, he clicks into his skis and rides down the snow-covered rooftops of Avoriaz. Richard is throwing one backflip after another at a vertiginous height before executing insane tricks on the wooden facades and in the streets of the French ski resort.<br /><br />This ambitious project was initiated three years ago, but in January 2016, Richard broke his two heels on a severe landing after jumping from one of the rooftops. <br />After hundreds of hours of physical therapy, he’s making a spectacular come back among the elite of freeski, to complete this unfinished chapter of his athlete life.<br /><br />Athlete: Richard Permin<br />Directed by: Maxime Moulin, Antoine Frioux &amp; Richard Permin<br />Edited by: Maxime Moulin &amp; Antoine Frioux<br />Pictures: Dom Daher<br />Art Direction: Niels Saint-Viteux<br />Sound Mix: Thomas Roche<br />Produced by PVS COMPANY &amp; RED BULL MEDIA HOUSE <br />_<br /><br />Experience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before.
