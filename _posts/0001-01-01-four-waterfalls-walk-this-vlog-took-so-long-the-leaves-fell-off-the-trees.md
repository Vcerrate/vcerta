{% raw %}The Four Waterfalls walk is a captivating woodland walk exploring the Waterfall Country in the Brecon Beacons.The Waterfall Country is an hour away from Cardiff and a top place to visit in South Wales. The Four Waterfalls walk takes you through peaceful forest, rendered even more so by the soft bubbling sound of the falls. The circular walk is challenging and includes muddy paths, steep descents to and strenuous ascents from the cascades. The waterfalls are best enjoyed in spring or autumn when the falls are roaring and spectacular.{% endraw %}
