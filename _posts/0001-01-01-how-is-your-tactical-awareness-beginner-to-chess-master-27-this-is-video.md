{% raw %}This is video #27 from the &quot;Beginner to Chess Master&quot; playlist. &quot;How do I know when there is a tactic?&quot;, or similar, is a line I have received in many messages. It's a good question, and one I attempt to help answer by sharing how my eyes see the board tactically. What conditions act for me as red flags for tactics? Do I think about the game in lines, colors, or possibly both? Are there specific squares that capture my attention? Maybe you can benefit some from listening to how I think about the featured simple tactics. Though the examples are primarily simple, you can be sure that even the most complex of chess tactics are often based on simple conditions. The term &quot;overloaded&quot; is defined in this video.<br /><br />Beginner to Chess Master Playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1Qh6W3v">http://bit.ly/1Qh6W3v</a><br /><br />★ LIVESTREAM <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitch.tv/ChessNetwork">http://twitch.tv/ChessNetwork</a> <br />★ TWITTER <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/ChessNetwork">http://twitter.com/ChessNetwork</a> <br />★ FACEBOOK <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/ChessNetwork">http://facebook.com/ChessNetwork</a> <br />★ PATREON <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/ChessNetwork">https://www.patreon.com/ChessNetwork</a> <br />★ DONATE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=QLV226E6FUUWG">https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=QLV226E6FUUWG</a>{% endraw %}
