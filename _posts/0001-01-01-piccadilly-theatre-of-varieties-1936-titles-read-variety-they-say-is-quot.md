{% raw %}Titles read: 'Variety they say is &quot;the Spice of life!&quot;  Today, we are taking you over to the PICCADILLY THEATRE OF VARIETIES, LONDON for a film-glance at famous Stage Artists at work. (taken during an actual performance)'.<br /><br /><br /><br />At the Piccadilly Theatre of Varieties we see several shots of eccentric dancer Hal Menken doing a little tap dance on some drums and up and down a short flight of steps.  The tunes are 'Yankee Doodle' and 'When You're Smiling'.<br /><br /><br /><br />Next act is Russell, Marconi and Vernon.  A man plays the accordion while another beside him plays the violin.  The violinist keeps knocking the accordionist in the chin as he plays.  Laughs from the audience.  Then Vernon appears - a girl in a short satin dress who performs several spins in time to the music.<br /><br /><br /><br />Then comedian Herschel Henlere keeps up a stream of gibberish chat as he takes off his gloves (and individual fingers!) then sits down at the piano.  He plays a chord then takes a hot water bottle out of his coat.  Another chord and he takes off his muffler (it looks like a creature as he bounces it off the stage).  More funny business, then he plays two chords and the orchestra play one back, knocking him off his stool.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Japanese juggler Gintaro balances 22 bricks one of top of the other with a glass of water on the top and moves about the stage as the audience applauds.  Gintaro lets go of the bottom bricks, catches the glass and pours the water into a jug held by an assistant (hooray!).<br /><br /><br /><br />American comedian George Beatty says he just had lunch - he thought it was a Gladstone bag smothered in onions.  He talks about a cafe in New York and tells some funny jokes about the waiter and the food.  Great delivery, and what a snappy dresser!<br /><br /><br /><br />According to paperwork, Tex McCleod originally appeared in this item - now missing.<br /> FILM ID:1654.29<br /><br />A VIDEO FROM BRITISH PATHÉ.
