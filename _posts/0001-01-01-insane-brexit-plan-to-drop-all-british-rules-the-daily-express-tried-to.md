{% raw %}The Daily Express tried to report on Jacob Rees-Mogg's trade border plans as dropping EU rules. In actual fact, it means following all EU rules on exports, over which we have no control, but not applying any of our own rules or standards to imports from the EU. The article is insane, the plan is insane, brexit is insane.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias">https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76">https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76</a><br />Article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1599741/brexit-news-britain-non-tariff-trade-barriers-iea-eu-jacob-rees-mogg">https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1599741/brexit-news-britain-non-tariff-trade-barriers-iea-eu-jacob-rees-mogg</a>{% endraw %}
