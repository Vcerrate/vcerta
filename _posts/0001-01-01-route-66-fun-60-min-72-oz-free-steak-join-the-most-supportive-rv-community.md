To our surprise, the 72-oz steak challenge at the Big Texan in Amarillo Texas ranked #1. Perhaps because the KYD community knew that the table would be set for laughter ... and it was!<br /><br />Knowing this challenge would happen, Marc &amp; Caleb did their homework and created a plan to dominate a combined 144 ounces. Months before the challenge, confidence was high. But the mood just days before arriving in Amarillo was another story!<br /><br />Eating 4.5 pounds of beef is not the only thing to do in Amarillo (thank goodness). We also visited the Jack Sisemore RV Museum. This is a stop that has been recommended for years, but traveling along RT66 was the perfect time to visit. The next time you're traveling through west Texas‚Äîwhich for RVers can be quite often‚Äîstop by to check it out. It's free and the collection is worth a look.<br /><br />Then we made our way to the halfway point of RT66 in Adrian, TX. It's a small town, but as Trish said, bringing your own fun is an essential ingredient when it comes to traveling the Mother Road (or anywhere, for that matter!).<br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è KYD Insiders <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/KeepYourDaydream">https://www.patreon.com/KeepYourDaydream</a> <br />Join the most supportive and genuine RV community ever.
