{% raw %}How to live in the present moment is the question and Sadhguru while answering this question he told   about his college time and said that he struck with small leaf and tree for very long time. He said as he don't know about any of things around, he used to just keep looking at them with amusement. Even now, we don't know about a single atom in its entirety and we need to have focus on things around.<br />Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev is someone who makes understanding of life and around it easy with his Simple yet very effective approach. He is straight to the point, bang on the issue in a no nonsense way and cleans up all the unnecessary confusions around many aspects of life. He answers questions which appear quite complicated and listen to the answers, you will know they are not actually complicated but with our thought process and limited ideas, we have complicated them.<br />He says we need to see things as they are but not with our predefined perceptions. Humans complicate their life and journey with limited ideas and egos that I am always correct and everyone has to listen to me. If we check our self, our own mind won’t listen to us and expecting someone else to follow our ideas is not practical. He says whatever the situations around you, if you keep your senses in your control and not effected by external influences, you are near to realization.  <br />Sadhguru is a spiritual guide to millions of people around the globe and his way of doing is not to understand spirituality theoretically but experience it with simple but wonderful yoga practices.
