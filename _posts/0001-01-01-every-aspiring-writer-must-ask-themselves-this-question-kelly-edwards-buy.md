Edwards’s career spans both television and film, having served as a key corporate diversity executive at Comcast/NBCUniversal and a creative executive for both film director Garry Marshall and producer Laura Ziskin. After moving to television, she spent six years as a senior executive at Fox, where she developed Living Single, Clueless, and The Wild Thornberrys. As SVP of Comedy Development at UPN, she developed Girlfriends, The Parkers, and Malcolm in the Middle. Edwards also produced the movie of the week A Christmas Detour for Hallmark, and the one-hour drama series Sex, Love, and Secrets. She holds a BA in Theater from Vassar and an MFA in Screenwriting from Emerson. Edwards has served on the Annenberg Inclusion Board, the UNCF Leadership Council, the ATAS Diversity committee, as a Trustee for NALIP, and is a 2019 Sundance Episodic Lab fellow.

This lens was a big investment for us and one we wish we could have made sooner.  Started using this lens at the end of 2013 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2tbtmOq">http://amzn.to/2tbtmOq</a><br /><br />AUDIO <br /><br />Rode VideoMic Pro  - The Rode mic helps us capture our backup audio.  It also helps us sync up our audio in post <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2t1n2hx">http://amzn.to/2t1n2hx</a><br /><br />Audio Recorder - If we had to do it all over again, this is probably the first item we would have bought - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2tbFlM9">http://amzn.to/2tbFlM9</a><br /><br />LIGHTS - Although we like to use as much natural light as we can, we often enhance the lighting with this small portable light.  We have two of them and they have saved us a number of times - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2u5UnHv">http://amzn.to/2u5UnHv</a><br /><br />COMPUTER - Our favorite computer, we each have one and have used various models since 2010 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2t1M67Z">http://amzn.to/2t1M67Z</a><br /><br />EDITING - We upgraded our editing suite this year and we’re glad we did!
