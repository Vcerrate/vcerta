{% raw %}On this week’s show, our panelists — Montreal Gazette columnist Stu Cowan, CBC Daybreak Montreal’s Jessica Rusnak and former Canadiens defenceman and NHL assistant coach Rick Green — along with host Julian McKenzie discuss the Canadiens’ past week, including the Habs debut of 20-year-old defenceman Justin Barron, the No. 25 overall draft pick in the 2020 NHL Draft, who was acquired as part of the trade that sent Artturi Lehkonen to the Colorado Avalanche.<br /><br />They also weigh in on these topics:<br /><br />The Canadiens showed no quit as they overcame a three-goal deficit with a flurry of late second-period goals to tie the game before falling to the the powerhouse Florida Panthers.<br />Looking at why the Canadiens continue to have success over the Maple Leafs and are 2-0 against Toronto since Martin St. Louis was hired as head coach.<br />How the Canadiens are developing character and a new culture under St. Louis and how long it might be before they’re a legitimate playoff team.<br /><br />Check us out:<br /><br />Facebook: www.facebook.com/hockeyinsideout<br />Twitter: www.twitter.com/habsio<br />Video Production by 5 Pound Media<br /><br />For all the latest on the Canadiens’ quest for their 25th Stanley Cup, sign up for our newsletter, HI/O: Montreal’s Road to the Cup, at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://montrealgazette.com/newsletters">https://montrealgazette.com/newsletters</a>{% endraw %}
