{% raw %}There’s a digital transformation taking place in our cars; are you ready?<br />I visited CES 2022 to look at what’s in store for the future of automobiles.<br />Sponsored By Qualcomm Technologies - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/automotive">https://www.qualcomm.com/products/automotive</a><br /><br />Cars are complicated. They’re a collaboration of nearly every form of engineering, and they’re ever-evolving. To get a feel for what the future of automotive entails, Qualcomm Technologies brought me to CES 2022, an innovation convention showcasing the latest technologies. This video will answer why cars have become increasingly complex, and also focus on three main aspects of future mobility: the digital chassis, autonomous driving, and vehicle connectivity. <br /><br />We’ll analyze the five levels of autonomous driving and discuss Qualcomm Technologies’ autonomous driving plans, including an experience with the Snapdragon Ride™ Platform on Las Vegas city streets. After wandering the halls of CES, it’s apparent that the future of cars is not a continuation of the mentality that they’re purely a tool for getting from A to B, but that they’re an extension of your daily living and working environment, connecting you to your devices, minimizing the burden of driving, providing entertainment, and creating a safer architecture for transportation.<br /><br />Don't forget to check out my other pages below! <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained">http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained">http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13">http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13</a> <br />EE Extra: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA</a><br /><br />Snapdragon Ride is a product of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries.{% endraw %}
