{% raw %}After having major surgery, most people would stay home and rest... but not Jason!  He is rehabing on a cruise ship!  He went to his doctor and physical therapist and they gave him the exercises that he could do on his own.  So we packed the pulley and squeeze ball and hit the ship!<br /><br />Jason worked on his rehab in our cabin, in the gym and even in the spa!  The thermal spa was actually great for relaxing the muscles.<br /><br />#CelebrityApex #CruiseRehab #CruiseRecovery<br /><br />Please SUBSCRIBE, Comment, Like, Share &amp; Follow!<br /><br />*Check out our travel &amp; camera gear on Amazon*<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/eecctravels">https://www.amazon.com/shop/eecctravels</a><br />This link has all of the camera gear we use to create our videos!!<br />Above is an affiliate link which means we receive a percentage of the revenue made from purchasing products via those links.<br /><br />*Support our channel*<br />Become part of our Travel Fam: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/eecctravels">https://www.patreon.com/eecctravels</a><br /><br />*Merch*<br />Get your EECC Travels merch here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/eecc-travels">https://teespring.com/stores/eecc-travels</a><br /><br />*Get our music*<br />Check out our music program Epidemic Sound for thousands of songs for your videos! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/rtknk6/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/rtknk6/</a><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EECCTravels">https://www.youtube.com/c/EECCTravels</a><br /><br />Also find  us at:<br />EECC Travels Website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eecctravels.com/">http://eecctravels.com/</a><br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/eecctravels/">https://www.instagram.com/eecctravels/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/eecctravels">https://twitter.com/eecctravels</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/EECC-Travels">https://www.facebook.com/EECC-Travels</a><br />Pinterest:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/eecctravels/">https://www.pinterest.com/eecctravels/</a><br />Email: alisa@eecctravels.com<br />Snail Mail: PO Box 12192, Alexandria, LA 71315{% endraw %}
