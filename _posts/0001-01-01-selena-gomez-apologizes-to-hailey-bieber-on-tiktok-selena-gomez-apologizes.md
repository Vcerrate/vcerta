{% raw %}Selena Gomez apologizes to Hailey Bieber following claims she mocked her on TikTok. After the ‘Only Murders in the Building’ star posted a skincare tutorial, many fans accused her of throwing shade at her ex, Justin Bieber’s, wife Hailey. There was no direct mention of Hailey in the video. The comments have since been disabled, but Selena allegedly left this message on the video: ‘Guys no idea what I did but I really am sorry. Zero bad intention. Deleting soon.’{% endraw %}
