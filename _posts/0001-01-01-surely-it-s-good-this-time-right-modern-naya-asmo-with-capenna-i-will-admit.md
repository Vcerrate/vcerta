{% raw %}I will admit I am very stubborn, and I just can't let this one go. Asmo is probably the card I have played with the most since the release of MH2 (even more than Rhinos) and for good reason. The card generates an absurd amount of value given you have the time to convert those extra resources into meaningful game actions. The one thing it was missing was a way to pressure, and that's exactly what we got in Streets of New Capenna - Rocco, Cabaretti Caterer is an excellent way to not only effectively give you more copies of Asmo when you need access to it, but it also provides a good bit of pressure with the ability to produce 6 power on turn 2 with a mana accelerant. I have high hopes for this one, let's see if it's ACTUALLY good this time or if I'm going to be disappointed yet again.<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />6:50 Round 1<br />26:01 Round 2<br />36:50 Round 3<br />56:20 Round 4<br />1:19:58 Round 5<br />1:43:37 Outro<br /><br />🖨️ Decklist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4793870#online">https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4793870#online</a><br />💻 Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/d00mwake">https://twitter.com/d00mwake</a><br />📺 Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/d00mwake">https://www.twitch.tv/d00mwake</a><br />📘 Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/jsAqzEU">https://discord.gg/jsAqzEU</a><br />📜 ManaTraders: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.manatraders.com​​​​">https://www.manatraders.com​​​​</a> (promo code d00mwake_ACW)<br />👕 Coalesce Apparel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.coalesceapparel.shop​​​​">https://www.coalesceapparel.shop​​​​</a> (promo code d00mwake){% endraw %}
