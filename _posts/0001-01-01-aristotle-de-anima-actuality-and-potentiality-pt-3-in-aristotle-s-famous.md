{% raw %}In Aristotle's famous work On the Soul (Latin: De Anima), he describes what the soul is, and its functions. In this video we look Aristotle's distinction between potency and act, or between a capability and its realization. On this view, the matter of a thing determines its possibilities and ways it could exist, and the form of a thing determines what is actual (and limits the possibilities). Basically, when you have a block, it can be used in any building whatsoever (it has a lot of potential), but when it becomes part of a city hall building it is actually a part of a city hall (its ability to be a firehouse or church building is restricted). This leads into better understanding what the soul's role in explaining what a substance is.{% endraw %}
