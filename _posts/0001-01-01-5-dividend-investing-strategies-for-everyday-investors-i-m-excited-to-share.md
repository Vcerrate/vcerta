{% raw %}I'm excited to share 5 dividend investing strategies for everyday investors that have personally worked with my investment portfolio. A throwback to my early dividend video days, this is the first video from my new backyard in Idaho!<br />#dividend #stock #investing <br /><br />Timestamps:<br />0:00 Introduction<br />1:37 STRATEGY 1: CORE DIVIDEND STOCKS WORK IN TIMES OF DOWNSIDE VOLATILITY<br />1:48 My top 2 favorite stocks of all time, Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) and PepsiCo (PEP), have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 during the last 6 months of volatility.<br />2:20 During a surging stock market, a lot of investors look down on dividend stock investing. (They forget about down markets.)<br />3:33 Key Point: Dividend stocks help investors stay committed to stock market investing! The key to investing is longevity.<br />4:27 STRATEGY 2: DEPLOY (OR SAVE) WINDFALLS IMMEDIATELY TO AVOID THE TEMPTATION OF SQUANDERING MONEY<br />4:56 A key point of my financial strategy is working at companies that offer equity to employees.<br />5:54 Make sure to check out my Patreon (see pinned comment)!<br />6:30 When I receive any kind of windfall, I try to deploy the money right away (or put it into a savings account). It needs to get out of my regular, day-to-day accounts (so I avoid the temptation to spend the money). Resist lifestyle inflation.<br />7:40 Earmark some of the windfall for taxes.<br />7:58 I'm building my Home Depot (HD) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) positions by about 28% each. These are some big stock trades for me.<br />8:48 STRATEGY 3: DIVIDENDS AND TAXES - IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT DIVIDENDS ARE TAXABLE (UNLESS THE INVESTOR FALLS BELOW CERTAIN THRESHOLDS)<br />10:13 Reminder: Reinvested dividends are still taxed!<br />10:33 I handle dividend taxes via extra withholdings from my paycheck.<br />11:00 HUGE: Some dividend investors will pay zero taxes (based on current tax code).<br />13:15 Tax strategy changes as oneâ€™s dividend snowball grows.<br />13:53 STRATEGY 4: A HUGE EMERGENCY FUND HELPS AVOID THE EMERGENCY OF HAVING TO SELL INCOME-PRODUCING DIVIDEND STOCKS<br />15:10 Emergency funds are even more important for dividend investors.<br />16:44 Politicians are going after investors. It's important to plan wisely.<br />17:12 I look at XYLD as an alternative to cash (intermediate-term savings).<br />18:09 STRATEGY 5: REMAIN INCREDIBLY FLEXIBLE AND HUMBLE WITH INVESTING (ESPECIALLY IN 2022)<br />19:14 I'm reconsidering accounts I had dismissed before!<br />20:56 Balance sheets and debt are very important to analyze in this rising interest rate environment.<br />21:40 DISCLOSURE AND DISCLAIMER<br /><br />DISCLOSURE: I am long The Home Depot (HD), Raytheon Technologies (RTX), and XYLD. I own these stocks in my personal stock portfolio.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: All information and data on my YouTube Channel, blog, email newsletters, white papers, Excel files, and other materials is solely for informational purposes.
