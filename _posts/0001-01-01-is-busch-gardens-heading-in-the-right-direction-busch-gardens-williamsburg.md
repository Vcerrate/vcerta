{% raw %}Busch Gardens Williamsburg is a park that just seems to do so much right, the park itself is  beautiful, the shows and food are great. And the rides at this park are top notch. If there's one word to describe this park it would be “progressing” each new addition changes the park in one way or another and within the past decade the park has solidified its spot as one of the best theme parks in the country. But Is this going to last? To put it in perspective the park looks very different than it did only a few years ago, this begs the question of Have the recent additions been good to the park? Or is this park shying away from the things that brought it so much character? In this video we're going to do a deep analysis of this park and answer the question of “Is Busch Gardens Williamsburg Heading in the right direction? And if not what can they do to get back on track.<br /><br /><br />Footage in this video were from the following media channels:<br />The Coaster Scoop<br />BGWfans<br />Busch Gardens Williamsburg<br />*All photos in this video were either &quot;free for reuse (acording to google), used with permission of the owner or from the direct party which they refer to.
