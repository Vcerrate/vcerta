{% raw %}In this English lesson I’ll show how Americans drop the T in many common words. It’s an important lesson on American English pronunciation—even native speakers are shocked by this! I’ll also work with you on how American English and British English differ substantially on this point. The lesson is full of examples of how to say these words like a native speaker. You will improve your English pronunciation and comprehension as you practice these words along with me. <br /><br />00:00 Introduction <br />01:25 Identify/Identification<br />02:11 Twenty<br />03:04 Wanted<br />03:40 Want Another <br />05:52 Kitchen counter <br />06:16 Count <br />06:30 Count on <br />06:36 Counted <br />06:50 Disappointed/Disappointing<br />08:49 Pointed/Pointing<br />09:13 Printer/Printing/Printed <br />09:41 Rented/Renting <br />09:52 &quot;Inter&quot; words <br />10:01 Accounting/Accounted <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/RE_sub,">http://bit.ly/RE_sub,</a> <br />Study with me in a FREE mini-course on accent reduction: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.RachelsEnglish.com/newsletter">http://www.RachelsEnglish.com/newsletter</a><br /><br />New to Rachel's English?
