{% raw %}All-Out war : Ukraine Azov battalion counterattack east of Kharkiv destroys 70 Russian forces. <br /><br />Just over a month after the first ballistic missiles slammed into Kyiv's international airport, the Russian campaign has been disrupted and derailed by stubborn Ukrainian resistance and in the last few days by agile Ukrainian counterattacks on several fronts.<br /><br />Russian forces retain considerable but not overwhelming numerical superiority. Their armored groups have struggled against Western-supplied anti-tank weapons and Turkish-made drones. Ukrainian air defenses have punched above their weight and are now being reinforced by thousands of the US-made Stinger missiles. Poor logistical support, questionable tactics and growing evidence of poor morale among Russian battalion tactical groups have allowed the Ukrainian military to hold off Russian advances in several regions and begin to take the fight to the enemy.<br /><br />Thanks For Watching.<br />The Thumbnail/Videos are for illustrasion purpose only.{% endraw %}
