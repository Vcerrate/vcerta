The clips and music I have used I do not own in most cases. My understanding is that it is in correlation to Fair Right Use, however, given that it is open to interpretation if any owners of the content clips would like me to remove the video I have no problem and will do as fast as possible. please Email - Navidbakhsayesh@gmail.com - if you have any concerns at.<br /><br />These videos are transformative in a positive sense, I take clips from various sources to help create an atmospheric feeling that will help people in different situations in their life. Be it overcoming hard challenges, giving them more fuel in various sporting scenes or act as hope for those who need to hear encouraging words. <br /><br />I also do not wish to use the heart of any piece of the work that would perhaps decrease the market value of the original content, if anything I hope to promote the content so that people can reach out and subsequently increase the market value. <br /><br />Lastly, these videos are to educate people in an entertaining fashion. Given these are very short videos the short parts I use within them act as a catalyst to further reading.{% endraw %}
