{% raw %}After almost running out of fuel, we show you the most unbelievable wild overnight parking location on the Scottish borders. <br />After waking up rather tired we jumped in the van and headed south, the plan was to arrive at the Scottish boarder however the park up was completely unsuitable due to the amount of flies. We turned back into Scotland and headed back along a road which led us to the most scenic overnight parking location, with panoramic views of England and Scotland. And, to finish it off we were treated with a spectacular surprise, a pink moon rising over the van. This is what VANLIFE is all about!<br /><br />On route we stop and Langholm for a play on the park and Ice cream and visit a monestry in search of some monks! <br /><br />Not the most exciting day but we want to show you everything, not just the glamour of van life. <br /><br />Live - Learn - Explore<br />Gary and Amika<br /><br />SUPPORT<br />If you want to buy Amika and ice cream and me a coffee, or to just help out, then please donate here:<br />Paypal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/TravelwithGaryAmika">https://paypal.me/TravelwithGaryAmika</a><br /><br />MY AMAZON STORE<br />To view my favourite items please visit my store.
