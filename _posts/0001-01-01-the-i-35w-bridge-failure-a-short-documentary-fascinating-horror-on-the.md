{% raw %}On the 1st of August, 2007, the I-35 West Mississippi River Bridge, one of the busiest bridges in Minneapolis, collapsed. The bridge had been in use for 40 years, and during this time regular inspections had frequently raised concerns about its structural integrity. The collapse would, however, eventually be traced to a design flaw that none of these inspections had ever noted, and which had been in place for decades before the failure of the bridge.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:43 - Background<br />02:59 - The I-35W Bridge Failure<br />07:07 - The Aftermath<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery.
