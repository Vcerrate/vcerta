This recording also contains subliminal messages. You will find the list of subliminal messages below.<br /><br />FAQ's<br /><br />Q. Are headphones required?<br /><br />A. Isochronic Tones and Subliminal Messages can be absorbed with or without headphones, so users can listen without headphones if they wish. However, headphones are recommended in order to benefit from the Binaural Beats.<br /><br />Q. Do I listen while sleeping or awake?<br /><br />A. You can listen to this recording whilst asleep or awake, both methods are equally as effective.<br /><br />Q. How do subliminal messages work?<br /><br />A. Compared to regular audio, the subliminal affirmation messages are recorded at many different frequencies and volumes, therefore you will be unable to hear the messages consciously. Because you are unable to hear the messages consciously, they bypass the part of your mind that analyses information, thus enabling the messages to go directly to your subconscious mind, allowing them to be absorbed as a factual new reality.<br /><br />Q. How long until I get results?<br /><br />A. It varies. Some people will only have to listen for a matter of minutes to notice an improvement, whereas others will need to listen for several hours over the course of a few days.<br /><br />Q. At what volume should I play the recording?<br /><br />A. At whatever volume you find most comfortable; but a low to medium volume would be optimal.<br /><br />Q. What should I do if I have more questions?<br /><br />A.
