{% raw %}Today's episode I'm joined by Parry Shen.  While you may know Parry best as “Brad” on General Hospital, he’s appeared in 350 film and television roles and his voiceover resume includes video games and audio books. Recently, he has co-created two graphic novels and produced the movie “Unidentified”, available on Amazon. <br /><br />When not acting, Parry strives to demystify the acting business and sharing his experiences as an Asian American in the media to college students across the country.<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mauricebenard/">https://www.instagram.com/mauricebenard/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mauricebenard">https://twitter.com/mauricebenard</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MauriceBenard/">https://www.facebook.com/MauriceBenard/</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mbstateofmind/">https://www.instagram.com/mbstateofmind/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mbstateofmind">https://twitter.com/mbstateofmind</a><br />Learn more about State Of Mind at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mbstateofmind.com.">https://www.mbstateofmind.com.</a><br /><br />If you'd like to learn more about my life, I've recently released &quot;Nothing General About It - How Love (and Lithium) Saved Me On and Off General Hospital&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062973371?tag=harpercollinsus-20">https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062973371?tag=harpercollinsus-20</a>{% endraw %}
