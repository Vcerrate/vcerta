{% raw %}This tutorial introduces energy in the context of electricity, and runs through a quick comparison of the energy consumption of a 1,200W toaster and a 6W LED lightbulb running for different amounts of time.<br /><br />This video is part of a full free course on electric circuits. The course covers DC circuits, circuit laws, current &amp; voltage sources, series &amp; parallel resistors, nodal analysis, mesh analysis, and AC circuits: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.engineer4free.com/circuits">https://www.engineer4free.com/circuits</a><br /><br />If you found this video helpful, please consider supporting my work on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/engineer4free">https://www.patreon.com/engineer4free</a><br /><br />Donâ€™t forget to subscribe on YouTube and join the Engineer4Free mail list:<br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=engineer4free">https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=engineer4free</a><br />Mail List: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.engineer4free.com/newsletter">http://www.engineer4free.com/newsletter</a><br /><br />Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/engineer4free">http://www.facebook.com/engineer4free</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/engineer4free/">https://www.instagram.com/engineer4free/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/engineer4free">http://www.twitter.com/engineer4free</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching, I hope it helps!{% endraw %}
