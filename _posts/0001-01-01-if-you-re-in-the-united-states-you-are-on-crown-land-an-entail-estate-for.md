{% raw %}SUPPORT THE DEJURE VISIBLE ENGLISH CHURCH DIVINE MISSION, <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cash.app/$Englishchurch">https://cash.app/$Englishchurch</a><br />The Third Temple English Church of England, a Royal Peculiar<br /><br />We are the long lost English heirs and Free People from The Empire of Great Britain who were disconnected from our families through Dissolution of the monasteries, British Slave Trade, and Birth Certificates from &quot;Corporations&quot; called &quot;States,City,Counties,etc&quot;.  The visible Free English Church whose rights and protections predate the Gregorian Mission of 596, principles are solidified through The English Magna Carta, and codified today in modern day Statutes. Only through The Third Temple English Church can you re-attach yourself as English heirs  to your ancestral blood-right pedigree which connects you to your lost nobility that goes back to Time Immemorial 1189.<br /><br />You are who your forebears were without doubt or contradiction.<br /><br />The Religion Act 1580 (23 Eliz.1 c. 1) was an Act of the Parliament of England during the English Reformation.[1]<br /><br />The Act made it high treason to persuade English subjects to withdraw their allegiance to the King/ Queen, or from the Church of England to Rome, or to promise obedience to a foreign authority. <br />If anyone have further questions and would like a One on One consultation, email The Third Temple English Church to set up a live zoom meeting with one of the Archbishops. We thank those who donate to us for our time.<br /><br />www.thirdtempleenglishchurch.com<br />Email:thirdtemplechurch@gmail.com{% endraw %}
