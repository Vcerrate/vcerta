{% raw %}Hahaha wow. Just wow. Trudeau spoke to Ottawa residents, pretending they're magically all against what's happening at the freedom convoy, and then tries to change the discussion to &quot;climate change&quot;. How can he be so off the mark? And talk about an obvious attempt to change the narrative into &quot;climate&quot; to support more big government control. Typical.<br /><br />#freedomconvoy2022 #climatechange{% endraw %}
