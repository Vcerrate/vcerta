But these same believers may find themselves unable to reconcile the Word with what they experience. They live in frustration or disillusionment, wondering why God’s promises don’t seem to be working for them. But God is no respecter of persons (Rom. 2:11). What He has done for one, He’s done for all.  <br /> <br />With Andrew Wommack’s You’ve Already Got It! teaching, you’ll learn how to go from frustration to fulfillment in your relationship with God and His promises. The truth is, you’re not waiting on God to bless you. He has already done it! <br /> <br />You’ve Already Got It! Package—$60 (a $90 value)  <br />• You’ve Already Got It!
