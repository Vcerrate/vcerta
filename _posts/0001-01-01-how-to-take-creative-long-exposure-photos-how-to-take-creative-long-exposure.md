{% raw %}How to take CREATIVE LONG EXPOSURE photos<br /><br />One of the things that makes long exposure photography so striking is how it has the power completely alter your viewer’s whole perception of a place. With a long exposure, you are dealing with an extended passage of time, compressed down into a single image. It’s a form of photography that is very far removed from making images of the world we experience in day-to-day life. You can use it to create images that play with our perception of reality. Images can be more surreal, more dream-like. <br /><br />Long exposure is also a great way to make your shot immediately say “This photograph is not a snapshot.” It gives your work a gravitas that commands attention. It can also bring out the best in you as a photographer, because it forces you to take your time and think about every detail of your shot. <br /><br />But there’s a lot more you can do with long exposure than you might think. It’s so much more than just light-trail night shots of cities and black and white ‘art’ images of the sea. There are many creative and interesting ways you as a photographer can utilise long exposure to make images that really capture people’s attention.<br /><br />♫ Main Video Essay Music Score by Jamie Windsor (me) ♫<br />♫ Split-screen tutorial section: 'The Setup' by Gerhard Feng (with additional tracks by me) ♫<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Links<br />💾💾💾💾💾💾<br />MY INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jamiewindsor/">https://www.instagram.com/jamiewindsor/</a><br />PATREON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/jamiewindsor">https://www.patreon.com/jamiewindsor</a><br /><br />Retro Video Assets Pack:<br />💾💾💾💾💾💾<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jamiewindsor.com/retroassets">https://jamiewindsor.com/retroassets</a> <br /><br />Lightroom Preset Packs:<br />💾💾💾💾💾💾<br />Full shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sellfy.com/jamiewindsor/">https://sellfy.com/jamiewindsor/</a><br />#1 My presets: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jamiewindsor.com/presets1">https://jamiewindsor.com/presets1</a><br />#2 Medium Format Film Stock: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jamiewindsor.com/presets2">https://jamiewindsor.com/presets2</a><br />#3 Kodak Film Stock: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jamiewindsor.com/presets3">https://jamiewindsor.com/presets3</a><br />#3.1 Kodachrome Film Stock: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jamiewindsor.com/presets3-1">https://jamiewindsor.com/presets3-1</a><br />#3.2 Kodak Portra Stock: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jamiewindsor.com/portra">https://jamiewindsor.com/portra</a><br />#4 Cinestill Film Stock: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jamiewindsor.com/presets4">https://jamiewindsor.com/presets4</a><br />#5 Fujifilm Stock: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jamiewindsor.com/presets5">https://jamiewindsor.com/presets5</a><br /><br />Preset bundle deal (20% off): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jamiewindsor.sellfy.store/p/lnus/">https://jamiewindsor.sellfy.store/p/lnus/</a><br /><br />—<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://jamiewindsor.com">http://jamiewindsor.com</a>{% endraw %}
