It took six years of planning, designing, and sourcing various elements that become a part of this house that is a blend of nostalgia, luxury, and grandeur.<br /><br />Traditional Indian elements come together with Spanish/ Mogul/ Moroccan motifs to create magic in a space that has no walls differentiating the inside from the outside. The architecture and interiors are tightly woven together to tell a story of patterns, colors, textures, and materials that are carefully curated within each room. <br /><br />While the architecture was designed by Dutta Kana n and Partners, FADD Studio transformed the spaces with their interior designing, along with 3Fold Studio's landscape design.  <br /><br />Photo Credits: Gokul Rao Kadam, Ashish Sahi<br /><br />#MyGreatFacade is a series presented by Fenesta Windows in association with #Buildofy<br /><br />#indianarchitecture #architecture #architecturaldesign #architecturevideo #residentialarchitecture #contemporaryhomes{% endraw %}
