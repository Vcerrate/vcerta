{% raw %}The #TeslaModel3 is the best-selling electric vehicle in the world. #Tesla sold nearly 500,000 in just the US market alone. The #Model3Performance was introduced to take on the best from BMW, Mercedes, and Audi. With nearly 500 HP, 315 miles of range, and 0-60 in 3.1 seconds, it still remains an enticing sport sedan that will smoke a lot of high-end sports cars off the line. Factor in the $60,000 starting price and its no surprise to find a ton of these on the roads. <br /><br />We're also on:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/redline_reviews">https://www.instagram.com/redline_reviews</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/liketheredline">https://www.facebook.com/liketheredline</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tweettheredline">https://twitter.com/tweettheredline</a>{% endraw %}
