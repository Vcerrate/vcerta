{% raw %}Breakthrough Discuss 2019 was held at UC Berkeley April 11-12, 2019. The theme, “Migration of Life in the Universe,” brought together an all-star group of astronomers, biologists, chemists and other experts to discuss whether and how primitive life can move between planets and stars, and if that is how life began on Earth. Co-hosted by the UC Berkeley Department of Astronomy, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and NASA Astrobiology Institute and NASA Ames Research Center, the conference’s three sessions were: Migration of Life in the Universe, chaired by Penelope Boston and Lindy Elkins-Tanton; Search for Extraterrestrial Genomes, chaired by Drew Endy and Gary Ruvkun; and Emigration of Earth Life, chaired by Kate Adamala and Sara Walker.
