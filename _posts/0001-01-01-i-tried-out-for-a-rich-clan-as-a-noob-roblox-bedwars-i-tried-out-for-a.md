The rich clan members had a few questions and missions for me, so I tried doing what they say but also trolling or surprising them. This is an admin commands trolling / funny moments video! This was made during the season 4 update!<br /><br />What is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It‚Äôs unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (‚ÄúRobux‚Äù). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.<br /><br />(Background Song Credit)<br />Music provided by Argofox:<br />Valesco - Cloud 9<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/nRa-eGzpT6o">https://youtu.be/nRa-eGzpT6o</a><br /><br />#Telanthric #Roblox #RobloxBedWars<br /><br />This video is: I Tried Out for a RICH Clan, as a NOOB (Roblox BedWars)<br />Thank you for watching!{% endraw %}
