{% raw %}~ Twelve years ago, almost to the day, on March 18th 2009, The Decemberists made the live debut of their rock opera “The Hazards of Love” at Stubbs in Austin, TX. NPR was there to film the proceedings. <br />Some of this footage can be found on NPR’s youtube channel and The Decemberists’ own channel. But, the complete concert with high quality soundboard audio cannot be found. At least not in the wilds of the internet. So, I took it upon myself to edit together all of the best footage I could find. Some video is taken from the Stubbs concert, one song I found from their ACL 2009 concert but mostly the footage is from the fans.<br /> I stripped away all of the audio and used the music you hear in the video from a record The Decemberists released this year (2021) of a concert they played at the Royal Oak Music Theatre in Royal Oak, Michigan in August of 2009. <br />I synced the audio to the footage to the best of my abilities. The finished “Stitched” concert came out surprisingly well. The band were in great form every night.<br />I hope you enjoy the “Stitched” version of The Hazards of Love Live.<br /><br /><br />I do not own any of the footage or music. <br /><br />~You can support The Decemberists by going to their website and enjoying their fantastic work.~<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.decemberists.com/">http://www.decemberists.com/</a><br /><br />Playlist of all of the footage used in this video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk2e17k2vY3Vt6l4AWg70PcTUxuQDdVH6">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk2e17k2vY3Vt6l4AWg70PcTUxuQDdVH6</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />0:00 Prelude<br />3:20 The Hazards of Love 1<br />7:32 Bower Scene<br />9:50 Won't Want for Love (Margaret in the Taiga)<br />13:55 ​The Hazards of Love 2 (Wager All)<br />18:19 The Queens Approach<br />18:44 Isn't It a Lovely Night<br />22:14 The Wanting Comes in Waves-Repaid<br />28:24 An Interlude<br />31:00 The Rake's Song<br />33:04 The Abduction of Margaret<br />35:13 The Queen's Rebuke-The Crossing<br />39:32 Annan Water<br />44:37 Margaret in Captivity<br />47:42 The Hazards of Love 3 (Revenge!)<br />50:00 The Wanting Comes in Waves (Reprise)<br />52:53 The Hazards of Love 4 (The Drowned)<br />58:53 Credits{% endraw %}
