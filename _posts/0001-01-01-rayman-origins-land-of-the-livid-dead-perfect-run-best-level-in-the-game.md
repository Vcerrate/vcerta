{% raw %}Best level in the game. Who knew that hitting old people would be so fun?<br /><br />It took me a lot of tries to get a perfect run. The end of the fire section was especially problematic.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed the crap out of this game. Looking forward to playing Legends.{% endraw %}
