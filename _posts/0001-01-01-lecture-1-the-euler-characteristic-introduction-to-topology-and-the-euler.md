{% raw %}Introduction to topology and the Euler characteristic.  The first in a series of preparatory lectures for the FREE online Fall 2013 course on topological data analysis offered through the University of Iowa Division of Continuing Education..  For more information see<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.math.uiowa.edu/~idarcy/AppliedTopology.html">http://www.math.uiowa.edu/~idarcy/AppliedTopology.html</a> <br /><br />Note:  The goal of this lecture is to introduce the viewer to topology.  Only a partial understanding is needed for the online course. This is an inter-disciplinary course.  Thus you only need to have sufficient understanding in order to communicate with others in this course and to follow/participate in the online lectures.  A partial understanding of this lecture will suffice.  <br /><br />Lecture 2 can be found at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/2HS9ypIe8es">http://youtu.be/2HS9ypIe8es</a><br /><br />The complete list of preparatory lectures plus additional links can be found at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://homepage.math.uiowa.edu/~idarcy/AT/prelectures.html">http://homepage.math.uiowa.edu/~idarcy/AT/prelectures.html</a><br /><br />Some clarifications:<br /><br />p. 3:  Example:  A blue triangles indicates that the triangle bounds a surface, and thus this example has exactly two faces.  The 3 edges bounding a white triangle do not bound a surface (so a white triangle does not correspond to a face).  Thus our complex has a &quot;hole&quot;.<br /><br />p. 28:  Graphs:  Identifying Trees<br />When I said that a graph does not contain triangles, I should have said surface or face.  As in the middle graph, three edges can form a triangle, but if the complex is a graph, than that triangle cannot bound a face.{% endraw %}
