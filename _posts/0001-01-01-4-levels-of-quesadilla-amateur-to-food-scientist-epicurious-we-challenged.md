{% raw %}We challenged chefs of three different skill levels - amateur John, home cook Alejandro, and executive chef Saul Montiel from Cantina Rooftop - to make us their best quesadilla recipe. Once each level of chef had presented their cheesy creation, we asked expert food scientist Rose to explain the choices each made along the way - both good and bad. Which quesadilla are you ripping and dipping first?<br /><br /><br /><br />Keep up with Chef Saul on Instagram at @chefsaulmontiel and @CantinaRooftop<br /><br />Alejandro is on Instagram at @mralexalba<br /><br />Follow John at @johndlopresto<br /><br />Rose is on Instagram at @rosemarytrout_foodscience<br /><br />Still haven’t subscribed to Epicurious on YouTube? ►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/epiyoutubesub">http://bit.ly/epiyoutubesub</a><br /><br /><br /><br />ABOUT EPICURIOUS<br /><br />Browse thousands of recipes and videos from Bon Appétit, Gourmet, and more.
