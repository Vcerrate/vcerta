One you can’t change, and one you CAN change.<br />Improve your facial appearance<br />If you are looking tired all the time with dark circles and bags, get quality slumber. Also go see a doctor. And last, grooming your eyebrows symmetrically and naturally. Alpha demonstrates.<br />Improve your complexion by removing blackheads, wash your face 2xs a day, and apply a morning moisturizer with an SPF 20+.<br />Understand and utilize facial hair to add balance and structure. Use an optimal grooming tool, which Alpha emphasizes that each of you should have a Brio Beardscape. It’s the best grooming tool on the market — check out the side-by-side unsponsored comparison Alpha published Brio VS NorelcoAnd now the Beardscape has an amazing little brother — same quality and battery-life but it’s smaller and more compact (perfect for traveling). Alpha just tosses it in his dopp kit, and he’s ready to go.  Use Alpha’s link for a great deal (which will sell out fast, as it always does): Brio Beardscape and Axis trimmers<br />Choose a better hairstyle that goes along with your face shape (circle, square, oval, diamond). Take a selfie as Alpha describes then draw shapes over your face. Your hairstyle should be all about contrast — for instance: round face? structured + rigid style. Along with your hairstyle, you need sideburns. Drop to mid-ear and angle slightly to follow the contour of your jaw.<br />Build more muscles to increase testosterone levels which makes your face more chiseled and defined as well as it reduces chin fat. Your cheekbones will also become more pronounced.<br />Drink more water to make your face look better. One gallon a day will make your complexion clearer and the puffiness decrease.{% endraw %}
