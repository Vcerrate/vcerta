{% raw %}it's just so satisfying to get to the stitching bit of any making isn't it! I love free machining SO much, it's so relaxing...even when it doesn't quite go the way it was meant to! I love how the fabrics change andshift as you stitch, and you just have to let go of controlling what the threads do to the surface...<br /><br />Hello lovely viewers!<br />THANK YOU so much for joining me here, for your comments, for subscribing, and for your support...I love being here with you!<br /><br />☆my ETSY shop - buy beautiful gifts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/EmmaWigginton">https://www.etsy.com/shop/EmmaWigginton</a><br /><br />☆my NEWSLETTER: sign up here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.emmawigginton.co.uk/newsletter.html">https://www.emmawigginton.co.uk/newsletter.html</a><br /><br />☆Social Media: FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/EmmaWiggintonStitchedTextileArt/">https://www.facebook.com/EmmaWiggintonStitchedTextileArt/</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/emmawiggintontextiles/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/emmawiggintontextiles/?hl=en</a><br />☆MUSIC:for a little fun: Ratatouille's Kitchen - Carmen María and Edu Espinal; thank you, it makes me smile and I hope it gets you dancing!{% endraw %}
