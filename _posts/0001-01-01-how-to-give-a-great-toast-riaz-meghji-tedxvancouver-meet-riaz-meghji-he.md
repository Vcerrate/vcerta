{% raw %}Meet Riaz Meghji – he’s worked as a Television Host and Producer in Canada for almost two decades. He’s been the Host of Breakfast Television Vancouver on CityTV for over ten years and before that, he hosted for brands such as MTV Canada, CTV News, Toronto International Film Festival and TEDxVancouver .  On the air or in his daily life, Riaz has learned that a candid conversation can have a profound effect—the inspiration behind his talks and his mantra (and new web series), “Every Conversation Counts.” He knows a lot about how to give a great toast when the occasion calls for it, so pay close attention and enjoy this insightful TED talk. As a co-host of Breakfast Television Vancouver, he’s been waking the city up with a smile for almost 10 years. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
