While it is informative to hear Novogratz speak about these topics, the main topic most people want to hear him discuss is what is the current state of the market and where is it going?  Novogratz‚Äôs forecast was somewhat mixed.  For the general investor, he believes things look bleak as the fed‚Äôs stimulus plan looks like it\'s coming to an end, which is going to tighten most markets and reduce spending.  On the other hand, Novogratz believes that there is some real promise with cryptocurrency, specifically Web3, and is focusing all his energy on growing in the crypto space beyond Bitcoin.<br /><br />#crypto #cryptocurrency #web3<br />‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨<br />THIS INTERVIEW WAS POSTED ON JANUARY 26, 2022<br />Listen to the full unedited interview here ‚¨á [Credits] üôè<br />Guy Adami interviews Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4ct1HhoRMA&amp;t=11s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4ct1HhoRMA&amp;t=11s</a><br />‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨<br />üéµBACKGROUND MUSIC licensed through AudioJungle &amp; Epidemic Sound <br /><br />üé•FOOTAGE licensed through VideoBlocks and Filmpac, except parts about the topic that have been used under fair use.<br />‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨<br />FAIR-USE COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER <br />Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
