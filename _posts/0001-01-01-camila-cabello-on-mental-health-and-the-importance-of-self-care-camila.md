{% raw %}Camila Cabello was honored today at Variety‘s Power of Women event, presented by Lifetime, for her work with the Movement Voter Fund to launch the Healing Justice Project.<br /><br />Alongside fellow honorees Drew Barrymore, Kim Cattrall, Queen Latifah and Amanda Seyfried, Cabello took to the stage to address mental health. “Through the Healing Justice Project, we empower organizers to focus on their own healing while also addressing the generational systemic violence and oppression that is felt by so many communities,” Cabello explained. “They’re constantly giving all of themselves but rarely have the support to fill their own cup. My mental health journey showed me that no matter who you are, no matter how much you love what you do, you can’t keep going if you don’t have the resources, time, space and tools to heal.”<br /><br />“I realized the importance of taking care of myself, but even more so, I realized that I need to help others do the same, to ensure that the grassroots organizers who carry our world on their shoulders and move us forward, have access to the resources that helped change everything for me.”{% endraw %}
