{% raw %}How can we transform higher education to improve the educational experience of students?<br /><br />On June 24th the Future Trends Forum will explore this question with Christina Katopodis, Executive Director at Transformative Learning in the Humanities at the City University of New York (CUNY), and Cathy N. Davidson, professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.  (Professor Davidson is no stranger to the Forum, having been a terrific guest in 2019.)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://christinakatopodis.com/">https://christinakatopodis.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cathydavidson.com/">https://www.cathydavidson.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/coHgQBCd4TY">https://youtu.be/coHgQBCd4TY</a><br />/////<br /><br />The Future Trends Forum is a weekly discussion event created and hosted by Bryan Alexander.
