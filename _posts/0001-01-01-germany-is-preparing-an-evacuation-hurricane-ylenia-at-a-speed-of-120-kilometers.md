{% raw %}The German weather service on Wednesday issued the second-highest severe weather warning for all of northern and eastern Germany as the country prepares for Storm Ylenia. Storm Ylenia is expected to bring hurricane force gusts with wind speeds up to 120 kilometers per hour in parts of Germany. &quot;This is a wind speed that we don't see in the lowlands that are so widespread every year,&quot; said meteorologist Adrian Leiser. Some federal states such as North Rhine-Westphalia and the Saarland have already announced school closures or allowing students to stay at home on Thursday, while Germany's state rail operator Deutsche Bahn has warned of disruptions to train services due to severe weather. The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency warned on Wednesday that there is a risk of storm surge along Germany's North Sea coast as the tide could be up to two meters above normal. Because gusts of wind can come on very suddenly, there is “a potential for damage that should not be underestimated,” Leiser said. Trees can be uprooted, roofs damaged and objects rotated. “Therefore, not only travel, but outdoors in general, should be avoided whenever possible.” Storm Ylenia will gradually weaken over Thursday, according to the German weather service. However, the next Zeynep hurricane, whose intensity could not yet be accurately predicted, was expected as early as Friday.<br />#ylenia #germany #storm #hurricane #sturm<br />Wahr,ylenia sturm,sturm,orkan ylenia,orkan,orkantief ylenia,orkantief,sturmtief ylenia,sturmtief,wetter,nrw,ylenia name,deutschland,sturm nrw,sturmwarnung,ylenia carrisi,ylenia lucaselli,zeynep,bild,orkan deutschland,sturm deutschland,orkan nrw,sturm morgen,unwetterwarnung,sturm aktuell,orkan hamburg,sturm sabine,wetter morgen,orkan berlin,sturmtief nrw,sturmtief niedersachsen,sturmtief aktuell,ylenja lucaselli,windstärke,extreme weather,weather{% endraw %}
