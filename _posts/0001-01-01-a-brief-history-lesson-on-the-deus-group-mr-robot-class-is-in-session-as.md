{% raw %}Class is in session as Price gives us a brief history lesson on the Deus Group. Pay attention, there's a test at the end.<br /><br />From Season 4 Episode 2 &quot;402 Payment Required&quot; Price returns Elliot to his hideout. He tells him about a group that funds the Dark Army known as Deus, which Zhang had built globally for decades. Price knows that former E-Corp employee Susan Jacobs had Dark Army ties before her disappearance and tells Elliot to get to the Deus group's money through her. Elliot gets a call from Darlene telling him their mother has died. They find that their mother owned a safety deposit box, but the bank disposed of it before her death. Darlene admits she is really grieving for Angela. After the funeral, Darlene confesses to Elliot that she killed Susan Jacobs and joins him against Whiterose. She thanks him for taking care of Vera, who has returned. Elliot argues with Mr. Robot, with both of them denying any knowledge of Vera's return. In his mind, Elliot's mother tells a younger version of himself to wait for 'the other one.' Meanwhile, Dominique lies to the FBI about what happened to Santiago, only for her interrogator to be killed in a faux suicide by Janice. Price tells Zhang that he is resigning from E-Corp and thus cutting ties with the Dark Army, which will force the Deus group to meet in person to choose his successor.<br /><br />hello, friend... welcome to the official MR.
