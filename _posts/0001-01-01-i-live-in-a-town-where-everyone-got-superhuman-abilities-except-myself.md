{% raw %}Let me explain, I live in a relatively small town at an undisclosed location. I'm not telling you where because for one, I don't want you getting anywhere near here. And second, you'll probably be killed before you even get here in the first place, arrested if you're lucky. Let me wind back a bit to the day where the &quot;Event&quot; occurred...<br /><br />🏆 Credits:<br />u/MWMN19 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/spacd1/i_live_in_a_town_where_everyone_got_superhuman/">https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/spacd1/i_live_in_a_town_where_everyone_got_superhuman/</a><br />Kian Concepcion<br />Nikita Konyakhin <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fiverr.com/nkmakesound">https://www.fiverr.com/nkmakesound</a><br />Sebastian Hue <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.deviantart.com/shue13/art/My-mind-has-no-fear-683742201">https://www.deviantart.com/shue13/art/My-mind-has-no-fear-683742201</a><br /><br />🙏Enjoying our work?
