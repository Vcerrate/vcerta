{% raw %}Lindsey Graham has been one of the few Republicans in the Senate willing to blindly say or do whatever Donald Trump wants him to. But now, after disagreeing with Trump about possible pardons for Capitol Rioters, Graham is being trashed by the former President. During an interview with Newsmax, Trump claimed that Lindsey Graham is now a &quot;RINO&quot;, meaning that he has little love left for the aging Senator. Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins explains why this is happening. <br /><br />Link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rawstory.com/donald-trump-2656529960/">https://www.rawstory.com/donald-trump-2656529960/</a><br /><br />Become a member today!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join</a><br /><br />Support us by becoming a monthly patron on Patreon, and help keep progressive media alive!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire">https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire</a><br /><br />Find our merchandise at Teespring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store">https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store</a><br /><br />Spread the word!

In fact, according to Donald Trump's latest rant, Lindsey Graham's not even a Republican anymore, just a Republican in name only, a RINO. That label that Donald Trump slaps on any Republican that goes against anything he says has now been slapped on Lindsey Graham by Trump himself in an interview with Newsmax. And what did Lindsey Graham do? Well, he had the audacity to say, I don't think giving pardons to the Capitol rioters is a good idea, as Trump suggested this past Saturday. So because again, one time Lindsey Graham says, eh, I'm not a hundred percent on that. Trump says, great. You're dead to me. And what's funny is that Trump isn't the first one to come out with these attacks on Lindsey Graham, Marjorie Taylor Greene actually did it like three days ago.<br /><br />So Marjorie Taylor Greene came out being the actual attack dog for Donald Trump, going after Lindsey Graham, saying that he doesn't know what he's doing. And so Trump comes out a couple days later and says, yeah, you know what, he's a RINO. Here's what Trump said on Newsmax. I would absolutely give them a pardon if things don't work out fairly. Some of these people are not guilty. Many of these people are not guilty. First of all, completely untrue. What they've done to these and in many cases, Patriots, they're soldiers, they're policemen. What they've done to them compared to what they've done to the other side, you know, you, you have to have equal justice and this isn't equal. So I would absolutely be prepared. And Lindsey Graham doesn't know what the hell he's talking about if he says that because you have to have equal justice. Lindsey's a nice guy, but he's a RINO.<br /><br />So the big question I have, of course this interview happened on Wednesday. The big question I have is what is Lindsey going, Graham gonna do to get back on Donald Trump's good side? Lindsey, you may have just lost your golfing buddy. You may have just lost your, your favorite guy to text message. You pretty much just lost your only remaining friend on this planet. So what does Lindsey do? Does he retract his earlier statement and start saying, oh, I could see pardons working out for some of these folks? Or does he have to double down and say, all right, fine. This is the great divorce. Donald and I are through. I'm gonna go latch myself onto somebody else that I think will carry me across the finish line, whatever finish line it may be, because that's what Graham has always done. I know I've talked about that before.<br /><br />But think about it. Lindsey Graham always hitches himself, latches himself onto somebody that he believe is going to basically take care of him. He's a very weak individual in that regard. He did it to George W. Bush. Then he did it to John McCain. Then he was doing it to Mitch McConnell. Then he was doing it Donald Trump. So what now? Trump's kicked you off, buddy. You're a RINO. You're not gonna shake that label. He slapped it onto you. It is there. You are done in Trump world. So I can't wait to see who Lindsey Graham's gonna latch onto next because it won't take long. He rebounds pretty quickly from, you know, breakups like this. But that's because he's a pathetic, weak, insecure individual that has to have the approval and adoration of someone else in order to feel validated about himself.{% endraw %}
