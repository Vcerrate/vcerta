{% raw %}Dr. Les Carter helps you understand a form of narcissism called Vulnerable Narcissism.  It is baffling because these individuals are often quiet and can be introverted, meaning they do not show their colors right away.  But over time, you will see how their behaviors fit the main descriptors of narcissism, just not in the grandiose ways as some of their more obvious counterparts.  To assist you, Dr. Carter offers a 12 point checklist.<br /><br />Dr. Les Carter is a best selling author and therapist who lives in Dallas, Tx. In the past 40 years he has conducted more than 60,000 counseling sessions and many workshops and seminars.  He specializes in anger management and narcissistic personality disorder.<br /><br />Join our Community:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://survivingnarcissism.tv/subscribe/">https://survivingnarcissism.tv/subscribe/</a><br /><br />Sign up for Dr. Carters brand new course Free to Be HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://survivingnarcissism.tv/go/freetobeyoutubepast/">https://survivingnarcissism.tv/go/freetobeyoutubepast/</a><br /><br />Download Dr. Carters FREE Ebook Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://survivingnarcissism.tv/understand-the-narcissist-50-narcissism-terms/">http://survivingnarcissism.tv/understand-the-narcissist-50-narcissism-terms/</a><br /><br />If you are interested in online counseling, Dr. Carter has a sponsor who can assist.
