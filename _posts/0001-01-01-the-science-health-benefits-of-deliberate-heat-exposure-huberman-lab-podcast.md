{% raw %}I describe the mechanisms by which deliberate heat exposure impacts body temperature, metabolism, heart health, hormone production, exercise recovery, cognition, mood, and longevity. I detail specific protocols for deliberate heat exposure, including exposure times, temperature ranges to consider, time of day, and delivery mechanisms (sauna vs. hot bath vs. open air heat, etc.) in order to achieve different specific outcomes, including dramatic growth hormone releases, or reduction in cortisol levels. I also discuss the ability of locally applied heat to heal or otherwise improve various bodily tissues and new data on how local application of heat may induce the conversion of metabolically sluggish white fat to metabolically robust beige fat. <br />  <br />Thank you to our sponsors<br />LMNT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drinklmnt.com/huberman">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a><br />InsideTracker: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a><br />ROKA - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.roka.com">https://www.roka.com</a> - code &quot;huberman&quot;<br /><br />See Andrew Huberman Live: The Brain Body Contract   <br />Tuesday, May 17th: Seattle, WA<br />Wednesday, May 18th: Portland, OR  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.com/tour">https://hubermanlab.com/tour</a><br /><br />Our Patreon page<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman">https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman</a><br /><br />Supplements from Momentous<br />I am pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered with Momentous.
