{% raw %}An extended car warranty may help cover the cost of certain repairs to your vehicle when the manufacturer’s warranty expires, but they’re not for everyone. While it may sound like a good idea in theory, extended warranties often come with a high price tag and don’t necessarily cover everything that could go wrong.
