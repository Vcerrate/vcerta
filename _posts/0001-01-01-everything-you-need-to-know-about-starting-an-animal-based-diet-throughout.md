{% raw %}Throughout my training and practice as a physician, I have come to one very disappointing conclusion:  Western medicine isn’t helping people lead better lives. Now that I’ve realized this, I’ve become obsessed with understanding what makes us healthy or ill. I want to live the best life I can and I want to be able to share this knowledge with others so that they can do the same. This podcast is the result of my relentless search to understand the roots of chronic disease. If you want to know how to live the most radical life possible I hope you’ll join me on this journey.<br /><br />00:03:44 Podcast begins<br /><br />00:04:29 What is an animal based diet?<br /><br />00:07:34 Why an animal based diet?<br /><br />00:14:32 Harmful effects of a ketogenic diet<br /><br />00:20:34 How to construct an animal based diet and why you shouldn’t eat plants<br /> <br />00:35:19 How to do an animal based diet<br /><br />00:37:51 The importance of Creatine <br /><br />00:52:38 Why should we not fear fruit?<br /><br />00:58:59 Paul’s daily routine <br /><br />1:01:09 Negative effects of coffee/caffeine<br /><br />1:03:29 Paul’s thoughts on eating windows<br /><br />01:08:19 Food combining and closing things out<br /><br />Sponsors:<br />Heart &amp; Soil: www.heartandsoil.co <br />Animal-Based Gathering: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.animalbasedgathering.com">https://www.animalbasedgathering.com</a>{% endraw %}
