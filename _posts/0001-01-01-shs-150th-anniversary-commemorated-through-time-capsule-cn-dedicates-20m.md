{% raw %}TAHLEQUAH – From the Cherokee Orphan Asylum to Sequoyah High School, the institution has had various purposes and names since its inception 150 years ago.<br /><br />To commemorate its long history, Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. along with Deputy Chief Bryan Warner and members of the council joined school staff and students on Feb. 28 to place items into a time capsule that was buried on March 4, the school’s 150th anniversary.<br />Becca Brant, SHS librarian, teacher and Student Council sponsor, said the idea to do a time capsule came about from Sequoyah High School teacher and historian Don Franklin.{% endraw %}
