{% raw %}In this video, I am sharing a walk through Habitat for Humanity seeking cool items that would make the cut for a small budget or small space.<br /><br />In my video, I explain that most of the times all that is needed is a bit of imagination to see the potential in an item as well as some TLC. This can be in the form of a sander, a can of paint and some hardware.<br /><br />The options are great when you visit the Thrift stores and its such a cost effective way to play with a new look or if you are renting and don't want to invest tons of money on furniture that you won't be using that long.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this video and tips, please consider leaving me a like. This lets me know that you enjoyed this type of content and want me to create more of this type in the future.<br /><br />MUSIC: Epidemic Sound{% endraw %}
