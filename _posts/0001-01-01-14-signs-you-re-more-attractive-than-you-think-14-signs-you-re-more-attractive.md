{% raw %}14 Signs You're More Attractive Than You Think. Do you ever wonder what makes people like you and how to know if you are attractive? Well, if you can recognize these subtle signs you’re more attractive than you think! Believe it or not, people have a poor track record when it comes to self-assessment. <br /><br />The majority of people often underestimate their appeal. That’s because we see ourselves differently from those around us. We tend to overemphasize even the tiniest of our flaws, thus hindering our self confidence. Having said that, people’s attitude and body language toward you might tell a completely different story! They may think that you have a charming personality, and you’re easy on the eyes. They may smile at you or stare at you, or simply behave in an odd way whenever they’re around you.<br /><br />These are all subtle signs others think you’re attractive and that you are better looking than you think.  Watch this video to learn more about the signs of attraction so you can decipher whether someone likes you or thinks that you are good looking.<br /><br />#dating #signsofattraction #afterhours{% endraw %}
