{% raw %}For anyone who was born in the 80's would know the impact of the WWE or WWF on the generation. It was a spectacle that everyone wanted to be a part off. Be it if they agreed, disagreed, felt it was real or felt it was fake - everyone had an intrigue, interest and informed opinion even if biased about what the WWE was all about. <br />However, after the glorious 80's, the controversial 90's and even in the early 2000 era of the WWE, it was still a very enticing product. Sadly, today it looks like it has come to its end. <br />With legends like “Stone Cold” Steve Austin, The Rock, “Nature Boy” Ric Flair, Hulk Hogan, “Macho Man” Randy Savage, Andre the Giant, Vince McMahon, The Undertaker, John Cena, Batista, Brock Lesnar, Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Bret 'The Hitman' Hart, Mick Foley, Ultimate Warrior, Chris Jericho, Randy Orton, CM Punk and so many more now reaching or already reached the end of their career, WWE is no longer what it once was. <br />Watch the video and let me know your thoughts. <br />Loy Machedo<br /><br />-------------------------------<br />TO SUPPORT THE CHANNEL<br />Donate via PayPal.Com <br />To loy@loymachedo.com<br />-------------------------------<br />TO JOIN MY PRIVATE FACEBOOK GROUP<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/LoyMachedo">https://www.facebook.com/groups/LoyMachedo</a><br />-------------------------------<br />FOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES<br />loy@loymachedo.com | +66-92-541-4784 (Whatsapp)<br />-------------------------------<br />WHO AM I? <br />Google &quot;Loy Machedo&quot;<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />#loymachedo shares<br />Why The WWE Era Is Sadly Over....Forever<br />Video 4644<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/kAGZhsWfKjU">https://youtu.be/kAGZhsWfKjU</a><br />#WWE #WWEAttitutde #WorldWrestlingFederation #WorldWrestlingEntertainment{% endraw %}
