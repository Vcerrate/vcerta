{% raw %}Deconstructing faith is complex. Some popular claims about the deconstruction movement (as well as the process itself) oversimplify it. Why do people deconstruct their faith? What is deconstruction like for those who do? Here I address 3 things believers say about faith deconstruction, hoping to provide clarity on the issue. My experiences don’t represent everyone’s, but they can still provide some perspective to those who do believe.<br /> <br />From a former Christian’s perspective, I take on the following statements:<br /> <br />“it’s just cool or popular to deconstruct your faith now and that’s why people do it”<br /><br />“Deconstruction is all about your feelings, not truth”<br /><br />“Deconstructing some things is good, but deconstructing other things is not. Go ahead and deconstruct, as long as you stay in the faith”<br /> <br /> <br />If you liked this video, you might also like:<br />4 Mistakes Theists Make When Trying to Convert Atheists<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/hprmo3CifJ0">https://youtu.be/hprmo3CifJ0</a><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-------------------------------------------FOLLOW-------------------------------------------<br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gm_skeptic">https://twitter.com/gm_skeptic</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GMSkeptic/">https://www.facebook.com/GMSkeptic/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />-------------------------------------------SUPPORT-------------------------------------------<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/GeneticallyModifiedSkeptic">https://www.patreon.com/GeneticallyModifiedSkeptic</a><br />PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/GMSkeptic">https://www.paypal.me/GMSkeptic</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-------------------------------------------Resources for atheists in need-------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />Find a Secular Therapist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.seculartherapy.org">https://www.seculartherapy.org</a><br /><br />Recovering from Religion helps connect those who are leaving or have left their religion with support, resources and community: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.recoveringfromreligion.org/#rfr-welcome">https://www.recoveringfromreligion.org/#rfr-welcome</a><br /><br />Resources for Ex-Mu’s: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://exmuslims.org/join-us/">https://exmuslims.org/join-us/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This video contains 100% therapeutic grade skepticism.*<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />*This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA{% endraw %}
