{% raw %}Best Technique!!! Skills sawing wood for sizes 6x25 and 12x25 - Chainsaw 070, In this video, we are sawing a large bayur wood while practicing an easy wood splitting technique. The chainsaw we use is a clone or assembled stihl 070 chainsaw, for more details, please watch the video, my boss.<br />This wood belongs to local residents and is planted to be used as building material and cabinet material and others. We saw wood with an assembled chainsaw similar to the stihl 070.<br /><br />Note: The sound of this saw is quite loud and noisy, for your convenience, 30-40% volume is sufficient.<br />Thank you for visiting. Please criticism and suggestions in the comments column.<br /><br />#chainsaw #stihl #woodworking #stihlchainsaw #stihl070 #sawing #sawmill #split #splitting #assembledchainsaw{% endraw %}
