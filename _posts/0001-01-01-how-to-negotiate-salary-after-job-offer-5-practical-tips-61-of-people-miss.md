{% raw %}61% of people miss out on higher pay, so in this video, I'm going to share my 5 tips on how to negotiate salary after receiving a job offer and help you get over that mental barrier stopping you from salary negotiation in the first place.<br /><br />In order to negotiate a salary offer effectively, you would preferably not do it over email, but rather face-to-face or over the phone. Then, imagine you are negotiating the job offer on behalf of a friend, since this helps you get into the confident and assertive mindset.<br /><br />You want to give a specific salary figure when you're countering a job offer since the other party will assume you have done extensive homework into your market value. <br /><br />You want to also have a walk away point (a worst case scenario) BEFORE you even begin negotiating your job offer because you definitely don't want to accept something that's way too low. <br /><br />Finally, when countering a job offer or countering a salary package, you want to rely on facts instead of feelings because you want to help your counterpart understand exactly why you deserve what you're asking for.<br /><br />Those 5 practical tips are will help you negotiate for a higher salary after a job offer! <br /><br />TIMESTAMPS<br />00:00 Intro<br />01:39 3 Practical Consequences<br />03:01 Imagine you are negotiating for a friend<br />03:41 Give a specific salary figure<br />04:21 Have a walk away point<br />04:56 Use facts, not feelings<br />06:14 Negotiate ethically<br />06:57 Bonus tip<br /><br />💪 Support this channel by becoming a member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwAnu01qlnVg1Ai2AbtTMaA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwAnu01qlnVg1Ai2AbtTMaA/join</a><br /><br />RESOURCES I MENTION IN THE VIDEO<br />🙋👦🏻 Facebook Group - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1190183907995020">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1190183907995020</a><br /><br />SALARY RESEARCH WEBSITES:<br />collegegrad.com<br />Glassdoor.com<br />monster.com/salary<br />livecareer.com/salary<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://salary.com">http://salary.com</a> and Payscale.com<br />onetonline.org<br />Cost of Living calculator<br />money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/cost-of-living/<br /><br />RESEARCH I REFERENCED:<br />Robert Half study: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/08/only-39-percent-of-workers-negotiated-their-salary-at-their-last-job-offer.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/08/only-39-percent-of-workers-negotiated-their-salary-at-their-last-job-offer.html</a><br />Columbia Business School study: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103113000401">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103113000401</a><br /><br />MY FAVORITE GEAR<br />🎥 My YouTube Gear - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/youtube-gear">https://geni.us/youtube-gear</a><br />🎒 What's In My Bag - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/mybag">https://geni.us/mybag</a><br />💻 What's On My Desk - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/mydesk">https://geni.us/mydesk</a><br />🛩 What I Travel With - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/mytravel">https://geni.us/mytravel</a><br /><br />MY FAVORITE SOFTWARE<br />✍️ Skillshare - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/skillshare-jeff">https://geni.us/skillshare-jeff</a><br />🐂 WeBull (Get 2 Free Stocks) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/free-stocks">https://geni.us/free-stocks</a><br /><br />BE MY FRIEND:<br />📧 Subscribe to my Productivity newsletter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jeffsu.org/productivity-ping/">https://www.jeffsu.org/productivity-ping/</a><br />📸 Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/j.sushie">https://instagram.com/j.sushie</a><br />🤝 LinkedIn - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsu05/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsu05/</a><br />👋🏻 Clubhouse - @jsushie<br /><br />👨🏻‍💻 WHO AM I:<br />I'm Jeff, a full time Product Marketer.
