{% raw %}In this video Gabor Mate tells us how we all have this sense of betraying ourselves when we are not truly who we are , we know if we are being ourselves or not. Some people have this voice or feeling inside that they are betraying them selves. Thats why the body also speaks to us when we are not being authentic. The body whispers , talks and then screams for you to stop. The &quot;blocks&quot; we have on our way are the most loving part of ourselves telling us that is not the way, this makes us return to our true selves. <br /><br />Thank you for watching Way Of Thinking:  The Dangers Of Being Too Nice | Dr. Gabor Maté<br /><br />FAIR USE NOTICE: This video may contain copyrighted material.
