{% raw %}This video deals with the most common English irregular verbs in alphabetic order. Each irregular verb comes with two example sentences, the first one is a question and the second one is an affirmative sentence in Past Simple. The past participle form (V3) is only pronounced but there is no example sentence provided. I thought it would be appropriate not to leave the third form out even if there is no example sentence with V3 because memorizing the verb at this stage is more important than using a more complex structure. The second reason that this video does not give the learner example sentences for the past participle form is that learners might find Past Simple and Present Perfect tense easily confusable when they are presented with both examples, especially Hungarian learners of English. <br /><br />Interactive practice: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.onlineangoltanar.hu/rendhagyo-igek-kozepfokon/">https://www.onlineangoltanar.hu/rendhagyo-igek-kozepfokon/</a><br /><br />The video is put together in a way that learners will have enough time for saying the verbs and the sentences out loud not just reading the content, therefore I recommend saying the verbs and sentences right after hearing them.<br /><br />The irregular verbs are commonly used and all of them have multiple meanings. In this video, there is only one meaning presented and the images also refer to one meaning only. I am well aware that there are many other meanings, and the one that is presented might not be the most common one or the one that you use. Also, many irregular verbs have different correct pronunciation which you may not find in this video. <br /><br />Practising the passive voice in English with irregular verbs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/E_tl1jVpZzs">https://youtu.be/E_tl1jVpZzs</a><br /><br />You can find other irregular verbs video on my channel, one with 83 irregular verbs can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/bpvo0k3rca0">https://youtu.be/bpvo0k3rca0</a><br /><br />This video focuses on the Present Perfect simple tense and you can learn the irregular verbs with other funny pictures in affirmative, negative and questions.
