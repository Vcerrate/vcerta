{% raw %}The late Fran Betters has created some of the most notable trout flies in the fly tyers arsenal. The Ausable Wulff, Haystack and The Usual are among the famous flies. The Usual is a simple(ish) fly pattern, tied much like the Haystack, but with snowshoe hare foot pad hair used instead of deer hair. The wing on the haystack is splayed out in a 180° fan and The Usual should have a 45° splayed wing. <br /><br />The fly is tied using the pad hairs of the snowshoe hare. It may be tied in a variety of different colors including cream, duns, olive, sulfur (yellow) and black. You can also mix the colors to get even more variations. <br /><br />You can find this pattern and Fran Betters' other fly pattern in his book using the link below. this is a hard to find book now and may be on the expensive side.<br />Fly Fishing - Fly Tying and Pattern Guide - Fran Betters<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2u5XPSo">http://amzn.to/2u5XPSo</a><br /><br />The Usual Trout Fly Pattern<br /><br />Hook: Mustad R50-94840<br />Thread: Fire Orange 6/0<br />Tail: Snowshoe hare foot guard hair<br />Wing: Snowshoe hare foot guard hair<br />Body: Snowshoe hare foot under hair<br />Head: Fire Orange thread<br /><br />Contact: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://piscatorflies.com/about-piscator-flies/">http://piscatorflies.com/about-piscator-flies/</a><br />Web: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://piscatorflies.com">http://piscatorflies.com</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/piscatorflies/">https://www.instagram.com/piscatorflies/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/piscatorflies/">https://www.twitter.com/piscatorflies/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/piscatorflies/">https://www.facebook.com/piscatorflies/</a><br /><br />Support the channel get the flies - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/piscatorflies">https://www.patreon.com/piscatorflies</a><br /><br />Southern California by Riot (Royalty Free Music)<br /><br />Camera: Nikon CoolPix P510 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2sh3WD7">http://amzn.to/2sh3WD7</a><br />Vise: Griffen Montana Mongoose <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2sQWcov">http://amzn.to/2sQWcov</a><br /><br />Check out my books on Blurb <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.blurb.com/user/pacres">http://www.blurb.com/user/pacres</a>{% endraw %}
