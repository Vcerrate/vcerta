{% raw %}Footage released by a Pro-Ukrainian source from the war in Ukraine shows the moment a Russian tank opened fire on a residential building in the area of Kyiv.<br /><br />The tank was captured firing directly at the building nearly even hitting the person filming.<br /><br />It is unclear if the shot was aimed at the cameraman or if a Ukrainian fighting position was suspected to have been in the building.<br /><br />However there were no clear hearable sound of gunfire or fights going on in the surrounding area so this shot raises a lot of questions.<br /><br />The scene in the video reminds on videos that got massively released during the begininning of the Syrian civil war.<br /><br />Back then Syrian tank frequently got recorded while firing at residential buildings and even directly cameramen filming.<br /><br />WarLeaks - Military Blog covers events, news, missions &amp; facts from the United States Armed Forces including the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy,  U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard and more!
