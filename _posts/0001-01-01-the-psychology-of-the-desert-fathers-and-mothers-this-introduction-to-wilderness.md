{% raw %}This introduction to wilderness spirituality goes straight to its roots in the Desert Fathers and Mothers, sometimes considered the first Christian monks and nuns. Will offers a historical and psychological framework with which to relate the desert tradition to the wilderness of your own experience. Topics addressed include: therapy and the origins of the desert tradition; wilderness as a metaphor for the psyche; the stages of spiritual development; the parts of the psyche; the eight thoughts; the rise and fall of thoughts; and pure prayer. Special attention is given to the desert traditionâ€™s contributions to managing solitude and building resilience as they relate to the wilderness of the COVID pandemic.<br /><br />A presentation for St. Gertrude's L.I.V.E. from December 8, 2020.{% endraw %}
