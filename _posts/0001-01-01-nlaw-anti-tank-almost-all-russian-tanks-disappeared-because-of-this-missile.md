{% raw %}NLAW Anti Tank : Almost All Russian Tanks disappeared because of this missile.<br /><br />NLAW is the best anti-tank weapon for infantry and troops deployed in complex terrain. NLAW can attack from almost any position, from the top of buildings to behind trees or in gutters. You can shoot down 45 degrees and can fire from inside buildings, from basements or from the second floor of a building out of reach of most tanks.<br /><br />Other videos you might like:<br />This American FIM-92 Stinger Missile Has Shocked Many Russian Helicopters and Jets : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYsyHl9Qw_U&amp;t=3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYsyHl9Qw_U&amp;t=3s</a><br /><br />#MilitaryNews #NLAW #RussianTank{% endraw %}
