{% raw %}My Old World 2022 Updated Review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4Cw5fu9OKY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4Cw5fu9OKY</a> Old World is a 4x turn based strategy game set in the old world, with crusader kings-like (and lite) characters, events, relationships and intrigue. In this video I'm reflecting on Old World, the full Steam Release version, my updated experiences with Old World, and how I was wrong about old world. Beyond the visual aids, you'll also be watching some new Old World Heroes of the Aegean Gameplay with the new civ, the Hittites! <br /><br />Contents:<br />0:00 - An Important Old World Intro<br />1:30 - Epic Games Exclusive<br />2:30 - Old World Graphics and UI<br />6:25 - In-game restrictions <br />9:30 - Decision Fatigue <br />12:15 - Orders, Training, Ambition, Legitimacy, and Difference. <br /><br />Reach out on socials!<br />TWITTER - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/jumbopixel_">https://twitter.com/jumbopixel_</a><br />TWITCH - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/jumbopixel">https://www.twitch.tv/jumbopixel</a><br /><br />Buying games and want to use my creator link?<br />STEAM - (Fanatical) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fanatical.com?ref=jumbopixel">https://www.fanatical.com?ref=jumbopixel</a><br />EPIC GAMES - Creator Code: JUMBOPIXEL<br /><br />HUMANKIND OFFICIAL PARTNER LINK - STEAM CREATORS KICKBACK<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.xsolla.com/pUr1yEcM">https://link.xsolla.com/pUr1yEcM</a><br /><br />Wanna support the channel?
