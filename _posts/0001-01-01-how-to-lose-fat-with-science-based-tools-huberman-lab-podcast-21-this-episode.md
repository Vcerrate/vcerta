{% raw %}This episode I describe the science of fat loss, including how fat is mobilized and oxidized (burned) and how to increase fat burning by leveraging the nervous system. Most people don't realize it, but our neurons connect to our fat and release epinephrine/adrenaline to facilitate fat oxidation. I explain how this can be accomplished with non-exercise movements such as fidgeting to burn thousands of calories of fat a day-- a practice is rarely discussed but very well supported by the science literature. I also discuss an optimal fat loss protocol using cold to create shiver, and how specific types and timing of exercise impact fat loss. I discuss if exercising fasted indeed increases fat oxidation-- it turns out the type and duration of exercise really matters. And I discuss the use of caffeine, GLP1 from Mate or guayusa and emerging new prescription compounds for fat loss. The episode includes a lot of tools, links to cost-free resources and explanation of the science underlying each tool for fat loss.<br /><br />Thank you to our sponsors:<br />InsideTracker - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://insidetracker.com/huberman">http://insidetracker.com/huberman</a><br />ExpressVPN - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://expressvpn.com/huberman">http://expressvpn.com/huberman</a><br />Athletic Greens - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://athleticgreens.com/huberman">http://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a><br /><br />Cold Protocols via The Cold Plunge:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thecoldplunge.com/pages/protocols">https://thecoldplunge.com/pages/protocols</a><br /><br />Our Patreon page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman">https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman</a><br /><br />Supplements from Thorne:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman">http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman</a><br /><br />Social:<br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab">https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hubermanlab">https://twitter.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab/">https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab/</a><br /><br />Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.com">https://hubermanlab.com</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />00:00:00 Introduction <br />00:06:00 Fat Loss: The Key Role of Neurons <br />00:08:44 The First Law of Fat Loss <br />00:11:00 Neurons Connect To Fat!
