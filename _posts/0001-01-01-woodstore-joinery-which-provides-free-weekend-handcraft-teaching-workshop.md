{% raw %}Marko Aharkov &amp; Meri Amirkhanian #CSBIC2019 Finalists<br /><br />Our idea solves the problem of lack in labor education in the schools. When I was in school, I hated practical classes like woodwork because it was so boring, mainly due to lack of materials and equipment. In my home city Kharkiv there are 200 schools and 75% of them do not have the<br />equipment or materials for practical classes like woodwork. Our dream is to raise interest in handcrafting skills among school children from 8 to 16 years old. That's why we would like to open a joinery which will sell unique wooden items made by us. We’re going to spend the profit to start a weekend handcraft-teaching workshop and to provide schools with equipment and materials.<br /><br />The target group is children from 8 to 16 years old. There will be 3 different age group (8-10, 11-13, 14-16) with different difficulty levels.<br />Our future customers will be parents of these children, young people aged 18-40 years old, ecologically-minded people and cafes and restaurants which use wooden tableware.<br /><br />We will produce goods from wood and sell them through the Internet (Instagram, FB, our own website) and at our showroom. We will also promote our products through taking part in folk art exhibition so that we can draw attention of more potential customers.<br /><br />There is no competition in this field in our region yet. Nevertheless, we can observe the rising interest in gaining handcrafting skills and we are going to fulfill the demand. So, it will be first free handmade workshop studio for children in Kharkiv.{% endraw %}
