{% raw %}Choices VIP: Wake the Dead Chapter 20 Angel, Shannon and Sledge Route (Diamonds used)<br /><br />THIS CHAPTER WAS GOOD!<br />Starting off the chapter we go face to face with our sister.. try to remember her of her past identity and it works!<br />I am not gonna lie after that the sister scene and all the fight i had tears in my eyes.. cause i can't even imagine MC going through the traumatic moment again..<br />then we come outside safe and finally have a proper burial for the sister..<br />after that the bonding moment was nice with the friends! talking bout future and stuff it felt like a proper end. and that too a kinda happy one.<br /><br />Although i wish there could have been a CG at the end when MC pressed their hand on the ground besides the burial site.. like yk the sister hugging him from the back in her ghost form or like pressing her hand on his to symbolize she's with him always.. yeah that would have been such amazing.<br /><br />THE AFTER CREDITS SCENE THO??? the queen which caused all the chaos was the one who saved the siblings lmaoo.. what a turn of events..<br /><br />Thoughts on this book..<br />It was amazing! start to end, no problems at all.<br />Although i wished for an another book at least like the villain of the book??? the tower head causing some kinda mess with the olympus i wished to see.<br />the buildup to the ending kinda felt a little rushed? i dunno why. the ending however was proper i felt like.<br />if i had to rate i would give this book a 9/10<br /><br />also i just have to say idm this being a standalone cause PB is a business, no matter how many feedbacks/surveys they take from us they gonna do whatever they want.. and as said perfectly by a user in my recent community post, idm if they keep doing steamy shit, not reading that but  if i get to read a book like wake the dead quality every month im happy. like every month or maybe once every 2 months?<br /><br /><br />Thanks for Watching ðŸ˜„<br /><br />#PlayChoices #WakeTheDead #AngelRoute<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Game:- Choices stories you play by Pixelberry studios.<br /><br />ðŸ“± Android play store:- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelberrystudios.choices&amp;hl=en">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelberrystudios.choices&amp;hl=en</a><br />ðŸ“± iOS app store link:- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/choices-stories-you-play/id1071310449">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/choices-stories-you-play/id1071310449</a><br />ðŸ“£ Facebook:- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ChoicesStoriesYouPlay/">https://www.facebook.com/ChoicesStoriesYouPlay/</a><br />ðŸ“£ Instagram:- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/choicesgame/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/choicesgame/?hl=en</a><br />ðŸ“£ Website:- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pixelberrystudios.com/">https://www.pixelberrystudios.com/</a><br /><br />SUPPORT THE DEVS BY PLAYING AND RATING THEIR GAME!!<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />My Social Media:-<br />ðŸ“± Twitter:- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/abhi_rio">https://www.twitter.com/abhi_rio</a><br />ðŸ“± Instagram:- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/abhirio_yt/">https://www.instagram.com/abhirio_yt/</a><br />ðŸ“± Tumblr:- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abhirio.tumblr.com">https://www.abhirio.tumblr.com</a><br />ðŸ“± Facebook:- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/abhirio12">https://www.facebook.com/abhirio12</a> (this only for posting videos, i don't use it to respond to messages)<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Disclaimer:- The Video is Fair Use according to the Copyright Disclaimer under the section 107 of the Copyright law 1976.<br /><br />Incase of a removal of particular video, please message me via email or any of my social media (linked to the channel and in each video description).{% endraw %}
