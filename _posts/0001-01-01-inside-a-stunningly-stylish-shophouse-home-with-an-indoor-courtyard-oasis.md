{% raw %}This week is a doubly special episode as we welcome Reuben back after a couple of months of hiatus (and a new haircut!), and we also have the pleasure of touring an incredible shophouse home in Joo Chiat.<br /><br />Itâ€™s a conservation residential shophouse that sits on 1,600 square feet of land, and 3,600 interior built up. It was designed by trader and interior blogger Vivienne (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thehomeodyssey/),">https://www.instagram.com/thehomeodyssey/),</a> and the result is a wonderful sanctuary that is certainly a very unique home. <br /><br />Her living room and palm tree courtyard is inspired from her travels and wedding in Tuscany, and the neutral colours along with the pop of green from the plants in the courtyard evokes such a relaxing and comforting atmosphere. <br /><br />Her kitchen is also a thing of beauty. The modern farmhouse look is perfectly complemented with the arched black-framed doors, and the greenery placed at the backyard is a picture that youâ€™d probably never associate with a home in Singapore. Not to mention, the Bertazzoni is a really apt addition. <br /><br />Thereâ€™s so much more to her beautiful house to see, for more, please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thehomeodyssey/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/thehomeodyssey/?hl=en</a><br /><br />Special thanks to Vivienne for taking the time out of her very busy schedule to show us around!<br /><br />Credit to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/patricklau.photography?utm_medium=copy_link">https://instagram.com/patricklau.photography?utm_medium=copy_link</a> for the cover photo<br /><br />00:00 - Intro <br />01:22 - Shophouse Information (History + Architecture)<br />02:46 - Entrance Tour<br />04:12 - Living Room<br />06:40 - Indoor Garden<br />08:00 - Dining &amp; Kitchen Area<br />11:29 - Heading Upstairs<br />12:04 - Family Room<br />12:33 - Babyâ€™s Room<br />13:31 - Common Bedroom<br />14:30 - Master Bedroom<br />17:24 - Concluding Thoughts<br />18:43 - Outro<br /><br />Follow us on our other socials, where we post more property content!<br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/stackedhomes/">https://instagram.com/stackedhomes/</a><br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/stackedhomes/">https://facebook.com/stackedhomes/</a><br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ Telegram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://t.me/stackedhomes">http://t.me/stackedhomes</a><br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://stackedhomes.com">https://stackedhomes.com</a><br /><br />Looking for home-buying advice?
