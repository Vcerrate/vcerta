{% raw %}10 Reasons Why The INFJ Stands Out From The Rest | The Rarest Personality Type. The INFJ personality is believed to be one of the rarest personality types amongst men and is vied with about a similar ratio in women. Every INFJ is going to be a little different; sometimes relatable, but most of the time, contrasting. To start a connection with an INFJ, you have to know what they are like. Theyâ€™re complex people, usually deep and empathic but appear cold and distant. They tend to always strive for excellence in almost everything. They are not the type to play along and be half-baked, theyâ€™re always in it for the long-term. Either youâ€™re an INFJ trying to make an impression to someone, or someone who found yourself attracted to an INFJ, this one is for you!<br /><br />â™¥â™¥â™¥Help Us Serve You Better!â™¥â™¥â™¥<br />Show us some love and support through our Patreon page: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/ON_TRACK">https://www.patreon.com/ON_TRACK</a><br /><br />If thereâ€™s anyone who can stand a talk in an hour, thatâ€™s the INFJ. They are very good listeners. Due to their sensitive nature, they empathize sometimes more than they should and constantly find themselves get caught up in other peopleâ€™s emotions. Most of the time, they tell their peers things they should be telling themselves. INFJs think they are capable of hiding and handling their emotions well when in truth they too have been bottling up so many questions and self-doubt inside of them. And for some reason, acting strong and offering a shoulder is a very cute thing for others! So go ahead and offer yours you do not know who might need it in the end.<br /><br />Knowing your personality type can bring self-actualization â€“ in one way or another. It is not about having labels or enclosing yourself in a box, like any other relationship it is about having a perspective, being self-conscious and getting to know your persona a little deeper. And a little piece of advice, if you really want to attract an INFJ, you got to have some depth!<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Thanks for Watching!<br /><br />Are you an INFJ?<br /><br />What more would you like to add?<br /><br />We would definitely love to know!
