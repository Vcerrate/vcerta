{% raw %}Jay Shetty talks to Ryan Holiday about why being too comfortable won’t help you grow.

Some of his best selling books are The Obstacle Is The Way, Ego Is the Enemy, Stillness is the Key, and The Daily Stoic. He owns and operates Painted Porch Bookshop, an independent bookstore in Bastrop, Texas.
