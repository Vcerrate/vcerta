{% raw %}Fresh to the shop, we welcome this 1993 Jeep Cherokee with a 4.0L I6. It's a bit bigger than our previous project and it brings some more modern features that we're not used to seeing in the Redline garage. I'm looking at you, electric fuel injection. But, Davin won't let that stop him from unraveling this puzzle as he sets out removing this engine from its home. It should be straight forward right...<br /><br />Thanks to our sponsor RockAuto.com.
