{% raw %}This video is a job we did to repair a Blade Lift Yoke off a Caterpillar D9 bulldozer. The yoke is worn out on the bearing surfaces and needs to be repaired. This shows the step by step process of machining down the bearing surfaces and welding new material (we are using ER80S-D2 mig wire) on to the surfaces before finish machining to spec. <br /><br />In this video we are using:<br />- Hafco TM-26120G Lathe<br />- Weldmac WHP-2.5 Power tilt positioner<br />- WIA 500i Weldmatic welder<br /><br />Join our channel:<br />We upload new videos every Friday at 5pm AEST!
