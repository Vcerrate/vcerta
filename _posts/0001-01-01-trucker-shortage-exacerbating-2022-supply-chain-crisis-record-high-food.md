{% raw %}In my previous video, I discussed why the impending food shortage of 2022 is by design and not a result of natural causes.<br /><br />In a normally functioning supply chain, containers are loaded, shipped, unloaded, and reloaded in a continuous cycle at the ports. However, what weâ€™ve experienced in recent years has caused this cycle to break down. Yes, we are in a shipping crisis, and 2022 is not looking promising at all. It appears things are only going to get worse at the ports.<br /><br />Now, let's look at another scenario. Although I doubt it would ever happen, suppose someone waves a magic wand and the government comes up with a solution for the crisis in the ports. And letâ€™s say their plan actually works within a few months and the shipping crisis is solved.<br /><br />We are still faced with a truck driver shortage, which is the second link in the supply chain. We know products loaded onto containers arenâ€™t going to reach stores by teleporting themselves or walking now, are they?<br /><br />Truck drivers ensure that 71% of goods in the American Economy are delivered to stores. Despite this, what no one talks about much is the current truck driver shortage.<br /><br />Even if we solve the supply chain issues and import an abundance of products from all over the world, the shelves will still remain empty without truck drivers to deliver them to stores.  <br /><br />I explained how the first signs of this food shortage wonâ€™t necessarily be empty grocery shelves, but high price increases youâ€™ll see well before that occurs. <br /><br />Fewer truckers mean emptier shelves, so what naturally follows is prices that continue to rise, unabated. Increased prices and inflation naturally follow.<br /><br />If we take a look at the situation in the midst of this dark winter, things seem to be taking a turn for the worse. Record high price increases, empty supermarket shelves, and extreme shortages across the country abound. While all shortages and price hikes can affect our living standards, the one that will hurt humanity the most, which I continue to warn you about, is food shortage.<br /><br />Hunger will bring greater devastation than anything else, which is why I continuously cover this topic and remind you to take this matter seriously. I cannot stress this enough. Be prepared! <br /><br />#foodshortage #truckershortage #supplychaincrisis<br /><br />00:00 | The impending food shortage of 2022 is by design <br />00:30 | Record High Food Prices Before empty shelves<br />01:16 | We are in a shipping crisis - supply chain crisis<br />01:42 | Shipping container crisis anticipated continuing in 2022<br />02:34 | China's supply chain crisis threatens the entire global economy<br />03:30 | Serious Chip Shortages in 2022<br />04:08 | Price hikes and product shortages are everywhere<br />04:37 | Out of stock: U.S. inventories near historically low levels<br />05:15 | The shipping crisis: the problem wouldnâ€™t be alleviated anytime soon<br />05:56 | Someone has detected a weakness in our supply chain<br />06:33 | The plan won't just end with permanent damage to the supply chain<br />07:25 | We are still faced with a truck driver shortage<br />08:30 | The trucking industry loses 6% of workers<br />09:14 | Fewer truckers means emptier shelves &amp; record-high food prices<br />09:42 | I continue to warn you about &quot;Food Shortage&quot; - Be prepared'<br /><br />Join:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV_6gLgd16QItZNXNurc3mw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV_6gLgd16QItZNXNurc3mw/join</a><br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ To learn the truth and prepare yourself for the future, keep watching Financial Argument. <br /><br />ðŸ‘‰  References, Charts &amp; Full Transcription: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://financialargument.net/trucker-shortage-2022-supply-chain-crisis-food-shortage">https://financialargument.net/trucker-shortage-2022-supply-chain-crisis-food-shortage</a><br /><br />ðŸš¨ All Rights Reserved Â© 2022 Financial Argumentâ„¢ <br />ðŸš¨ Footages By Financial Argumentâ„¢ Team<br /><br />ðŸš¨ DISCLAIMER: The financial and political opinions expressed in this video are not necessarily of &quot;Financial Argument&quot; or its staff.
