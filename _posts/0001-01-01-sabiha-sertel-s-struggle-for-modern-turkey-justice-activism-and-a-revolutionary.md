{% raw %}Tia O’Brien (Journalist &amp; Editor) and Nur Deriş (Conference Interpreter), who edited the English translation of Sabiha Sertel’s autobiography, are also relatives of Sertel. At the fifth session of the OTSA Co-Op, they introduced their pioneering relative, the nation’s first professional female journalist, and her autobiography, which chronicles Sertel’s unrelenting push for democracy and social reforms, ending in exile. James Meyer (Montana State University) and James Ryan (New York University) talked about their experience teaching the book in their classes. Ezgi Başaran (Journalist) reflected on Sertel’s experiences from the perspective of a contemporary journalist in Turkey.
