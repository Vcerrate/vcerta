{% raw %}Get Atomic Attraction (Audiobook/Kindle/Paperback): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/atomic-attraction/">https://www.developattraction.com/atomic-attraction/</a><br /><br />A man and woman sit next to each other in a quiet bar. “Who’s the most important person in your life right now?” the man says.<br />The woman thinks for a moment. “Person? Well, my parents, my family, my friends, umm, the people close to me,” she says with a smile. “How about you, who’s the most important person in your life?”<br />The man looks deep into the woman’s eyes and says only one word, “You.” The woman flinches. “I might not see you again, but right now you’re here with me and I’m here with you. You’re the most important person in my life right now.” And with that the woman falls completely under the man’s spell. Such is the power of words.<br /><br />It’s not uncommon for a man to become weak and vulnerable in the presence of a beautiful woman. Indeed, a woman’s beauty is her main asset. And just as men have a weakness for beauty, women have a weakness for words. Women, being primarily auditory creatures, are influenced more than anything by what they hear as opposed to what they see. This is in sharp contrast to men who tend to focus on what they see as opposed to what they hear.<br /><br />It doesn’t matter how far along in the seduction process you are, whether you’re dating a girl for the first time or you’ve been dating her for years, the way you communicate with women should always be light and relaxed. Serious talk is anti-seductive and the death knell of attraction. Talking about serious subjects (like business, the economy, and politics) does nothing to stimulate attraction or inspire interest in women. If you feel the need to brag about your achievements or about how great and successful you are, a woman will sense your need to impress. The confident man doesn’t feel the need to brag or talk about his achievements; instead, he lets his behavior and actions speak for themselves.<br /><br />If you want to maintain attraction with a woman, right from the moment you first meet her all the way through to a long-term relationship, then I highly recommend you get a copy of my book Atomic Attraction.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/atomic-attraction/">https://www.developattraction.com/atomic-attraction/</a><br /><br />Check out the Get Her Back (Action Plan) for the best way to get your girlfriend back if she's pulled away from you or left you.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/get-her-back/">https://www.developattraction.com/get-her-back/</a><br /><br />Please click the link below to make a donation to support my work via PayPal:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=FAD82HTR5UJ36">https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=FAD82HTR5UJ36</a><br /><br />Click the link below if you need Emergency Email/Skype support:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/emergency-help/">https://www.developattraction.com/emergency-help/</a><br /><br />Click the link below to send me an email or visit my website (DevelopAttraction.com):<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/">https://www.developattraction.com/</a><br /><br />Trust yourself and trust the process,<br /><br />Chris Canwell{% endraw %}
