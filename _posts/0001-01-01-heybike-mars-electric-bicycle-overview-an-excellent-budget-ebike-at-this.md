{% raw %}At this price range, Heybike offers a lot of features and benefits in their Mars electric bicycle. Fat tires. 500 Watts of power. Dual suspension. An easily foldable design. A two-year warranty. And it comes fully assembled! <br /><br />We tested the Mars electric bicycle on a windy Florida day. In pedal assist mode using the 7-speed Shimano shifter, Fresh was able to clock 23 MPH with this 500 Watt motor. The cadence sensor kicks in fairly quickly and provides some surprising torque. The Mars just wants to go! The 48 volt 12.5 Amp hour battery provides 600 Watt hours with an estimated range of somewhere between 37 and 48 miles, depending where you're riding, wind resistance, incline, your weight, your tire inflation, how much you pedal, and a host of other variables.<br /><br />The fat 4‚Äù puncture resistant tires will easily roll over most dirt and rocky roads, and the standard dual suspension will help prevent your brains from shaking. Dual disc brakes will ensure you stop when you need to. <br /><br />The game changer is Mars' foldability. You can fit two of these side-by-side in most full-sized SUVs, so you can finally take your electric bicycle to far-away bike trails, mountain rides, or even to the beach. Plus, if you live in a smaller space, your Heybike Mars will fold nicely and can tuck into the bottom of a closet. Mars weighs in at about 66 pounds, so make sure you ate your Wheaties before dead-lifting her.<br /><br />Yes, this electric bike actually comes pre-assembled! The tires are securely fastened. The handlebars, rack, lights, and fenders are attached in the box, so no more fighting with confusing manuals. <br /><br />Heybike Mars offer a smooth and comfortable ride. Fresh and Felicia felt safe on this electric bicycle even when the speed was maxed out.
