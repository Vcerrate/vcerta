{% raw %}I CAN WALK AGAIN! yaaay.. Back in the lab making videos.<br />This video is the first of a miniseries showing how to interface a camera to a microcontroller (ESP32 in this case) and display the image on a TFT display. As development environment, the Arduino IDE is used.<br />The code, datasheets and all the information can be found here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bitluni.net/ov7670-with-fifo/">http://bitluni.net/ov7670-with-fifo/</a><br /><br />Twitter: @bitluni<br /><br />If you like the video consider supporting my work on Patreon and get some extras:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/bitluni">https://www.patreon.com/bitluni</a>{% endraw %}
