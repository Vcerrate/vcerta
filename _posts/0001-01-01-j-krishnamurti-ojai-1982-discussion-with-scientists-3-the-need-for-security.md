{% raw %}J. Krishnamurti - Ojai 1982 - Discussion with Scientists 3 - The need for security<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Why do we want security?<br /><br />Am I separate from the agony I go through?<br /><br />When one is frightened, actually, there is no me separate from fear.<br /><br />The whole content of one's consciousness is unclear, messy. There is no part of it that is clear. We think there is a part, which is the observer, separating himself from the mess. The observer is the observed.<br /><br />When there is observation that consciousness is messy, that fact can only exist when there is total attention. And when there is total attention, confusion doesn't exist anymore. It is only inattention that creates the problems. <br /><br />If I know how to read myself I don't need anybody to tell me. But we have never attempted deeply to read the book of myself. I come to you and say, 'Please, help me to read,' and then the whole thing is lost.<br /><br />You must be free to examine. Free from your prejudice, from your previous experience, otherwise you can't examine. You can't investigate. Investigare means explore, push it, push it, further and further. Are you willing to do that, so that actually the self is not? <br /><br />---<br /><br />This channel is managed by the Krishnamurti Foundation Trust​​, UK​, and by the Krishnamurti Foundation of America.<br /><br />The role of the foundations was described by Krishnamurti when he said,​ ​'The foundations will see to it that these teachings are kept whole, are not distorted, are not made corrupt. They will not give rise to any sectarian spirit in their activities... nor create any kind of place of worship around the teachings or the person.​'​<br /><br />We maintain extensive archives of Krishnamurti's original works and all four Krishnamurti foundations are actively engaged in the publication of material in various forms.<br /><br />Our videos contain thousands of subtitles in more than 25 languages, translated by volunteers from all over the world. If you would like to help us with translating subtitles, please contact us at digital@kfoundation.org<br /><br />For more information about J.
