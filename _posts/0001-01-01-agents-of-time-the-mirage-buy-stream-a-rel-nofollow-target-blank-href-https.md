Their mesmerising approach to club music blends emotive melodies and transcendent rhythms, with dance floor-centred beats.<br />The Mirage EP begins with its title cut; enveloping the listener is a swathe of atmospheric synth and pad work from the off. Oscillating frequencies complement the sultry rhythms while a life-affirming riff forms the stirring centrepiece. <br />On the flip ‘Northern Lights’ is a sensitive, emotive composition<br />which gradually increases its emotional impact as it builds and evolves.<br /><br />Agents Of Time - The Mirage EP (AL062)<br />A1.
