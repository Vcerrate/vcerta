{% raw %}Eddie and Elsie are my neighbors. Both in their 80's they are the sweetest, kindest, most loving and wise people you are ever likely to meet. I can not begin to describe how important their message to the world is at this time but I hope this film in some way can. Their love for each other, and their love for the world at large and everyone in it, is a triumph for humanity. They have spent a lifetime nurturing and putting in to practise their secret to happiness, and we're so lucky they want to share it with us. Please if u enjoy this and u are moved by their words, pass this on. The world needs more Eddie and Elsie right now.<br /><br />Filmed and edited by Myles O'Reilly.
