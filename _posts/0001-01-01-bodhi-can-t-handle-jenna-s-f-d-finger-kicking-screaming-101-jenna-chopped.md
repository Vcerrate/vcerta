{% raw %}Jenna chopped up her finger and Bodhi is forced to stay in the marriage anyway. <br /><br />Sometimes it seems like Jenna enjoys intense injuries. At least she made a friend this time. Big thanks to Kathy for nursing her through and giving great notes for Jenna's character June on Fear the Walking Dead! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jennaelfman.com">https://www.jennaelfman.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/jennaelfman">https://www.facebook.com/jennaelfman</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jennaelfman/">https://www.instagram.com/jennaelfman/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bodhielfman/">https://www.instagram.com/bodhielfman/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/jennaelfman">https://twitter.com/jennaelfman</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/bodhielfman">https://twitter.com/bodhielfman</a>{% endraw %}
