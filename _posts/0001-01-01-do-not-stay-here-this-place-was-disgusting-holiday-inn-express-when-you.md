{% raw %}When you travel and pay to stay at a Large Hotel chain you expect it to be clean right? Well unfortunately that isn't the case these days and that was definitely true for our stay at the Holiday Inn Express in Odessa, TX while we were traveling back from San Diego, CA after going through Hospice with my Dad. After driving all day beginning at 7 am we finally found a room in Odessa and unfortunately it was not what we expected! I'll let the video review do the talking but we can say do not stay here if you are looking for a clean Hotel and a good nights rest. You will end up being aggravated and if the Manager didn't fix it for us chances are they won't fix it for you. <br /><br />Love adventures and seeing gorgeous travel spots?
