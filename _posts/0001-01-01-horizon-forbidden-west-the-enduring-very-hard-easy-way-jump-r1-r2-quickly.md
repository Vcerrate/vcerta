{% raw %}Jump, R1, R2 quickly<br />You still need to track her manually a bit. Usually she will dodge so give yourself a brief moment and let her dodge and then aim and spam the move.<br />Additionally, you can also boost your health with potion before talking to her.<br /><br />I know it says “Easy” in the title but you will still likely die executing the move because she is one tough old granny, especially on higher difficulty. So just “endure” a little longer. <br /><br />Good Luck!{% endraw %}
