{% raw %}The One Conspiracy to Rule Them All | Lord of the Rings &amp; the All-seeing Eye - This video exposes a conspiracy meant to result in the profaning of the Holy Spirit of God. It is demonstrated that the Bible itself portrays the Holy Spirit with eye symbolism and this begs the question: Is the All-Seeing eye symbolism used by the &quot;Illuminati&quot; actually a tactic of Satan meant to engender negativity towards the Holy Spirit? This would be a very clever deception on the Devil's part, since such an attitude would make it much easier to get men to commit the unforgivable sin of blaspheming the Holy Spirit.<br /><br />This clip is an excerpt from my longer video entitled: The Beginners Guide to Eye and Triangle Symbolism Part 1. I've decided not to continue that particular series any further. Though I may still address the topic again in other videos. However, in retrospect, I have decided that this portion of the original video deserves a video all its own. I also have taken the liberty of updated some of the visuals for aesthetic reasons.<br /><br />The original video in its entirety &quot;The Beginners Guide to Eye and Triangle Symbolism Part 1&quot;:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiGv2Zez38g&amp;t=533s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiGv2Zez38g&amp;t=533s</a><br /><br />Biblical teaching on what blasphemy of the Holy Spirit really is &quot;The Unpardonable Sin - Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit&quot;:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrp7cMDCZgs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrp7cMDCZgs</a><br /><br />As a side note, I encourage my Christian brothers who are interested to examine my Playlists section here on YouTube:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClh6ABQPVkU3N1fD7jb_6yA/playlists">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClh6ABQPVkU3N1fD7jb_6yA/playlists</a><br /><br />I have put together a lot of good material for the believing Christian, esp. the newborn Christian, categorizing it all the best I could. There is quite a lot of good material available, ranging from apologetics, which is reasons for faith and answers to difficulties regarding faith, to Biblical teaching, to in-depth examinations of various other worldviews, as well as videos exposing satanic teachings/teachers, occultism, New World Order/Illuminati type things and many many others.<br /><br />I hope the video edifies and builds up the Church of Christ. If you liked the material, feel free to subscribe to my channel for similar material in the future. I love all of you very much and I hope you're blessed in the Lord.<br /><br />Godspeed,<br />Theophilus<br /><br />Music Credit:<br />The Voyage by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a> <br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://audionautix.com/">http://audionautix.com/</a>{% endraw %}
