{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cretecarrierjobs.com/">http://cretecarrierjobs.com/</a> Tyler, an Acklie Maintenance System Mechanic, talks about how to add the correct amount of fuel additive to your truck or refrigerated trailer tanks depending on the size of the tank. Fuel additive helps prevent the diesel fuel from gelling. Fuel additive should be used as a preventative, if you have a more serious issue with the tanks, please get into a shop for a proper diagnosis.

This stuff is what we give out in our parts department. It’s good. It works pretty well, but you don’t need to over treat your tanks. This is good for 250 gallons. Most of our trucks run 80 or 90 gallon tanks. We don’t have 150 gallon anymore so you need to measure it out. One of our drivers let me borrow one that he made up right here. It has 50, 80, and 90 gallon marks on it. And that is the ounces also; 11.5 ounces for 90; 10 ounces for 80 and six and half for 50. Now to figure our what kind of tank you have in your truck. They all have a vin tag on them that say how many gallons that that tank uses. <br /><br />Crete Carrier is one of the nation’s largest, privately owned trucking companies, and has been in business for nearly 50 years.
