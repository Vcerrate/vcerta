{% raw %}GROW YOUR OWN Foodscape and organic garden in your frontyard.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://foodscapingutah.org">https://foodscapingutah.org</a><br /><br />In this video we discuss managing insect pests by growing healthy plants with healthy soil (for pest resilience) and establishing a biodiverse polyculture in your foodscape that includes a good mix of perennial and annual flowers. Establishing a polyculture can help prevent pest build up. Furthermore, planting flowers that provide pollen and nectar throughout the season will attract and sustain beneficial insect predators that will help manage insect pest populations. The video highlights a wide variety of beneficial insects including ladybugs, lacewings, predatory wasps, hoverfly, and praying mantis. We also talk about providing flowers for native bees, honey bees, and bumble bees. The second half of the video features lists of our top 5 recommended perennial flowers and top 5 annual flowers with footage of beneficial insects on them.<br /><br />For more recommendations on Gardening for Native Bees in Utah and Beyond (pdf Fact Sheet): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1907&amp;context=extension_curall">https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1907&amp;context=extension_curall</a><br /><br />Combinations for Conservation (book): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cwel.usu.edu/combinationsforconservation">https://cwel.usu.edu/combinationsforconservation</a><br /><br />Learn more about Foodscaping Utah at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://foodscapingutah.org">https://foodscapingutah.org</a>{% endraw %}
