{% raw %}Welcome to another episode of Trailmakers! Today I am looking into the workshop for sailboats to see what people are doing with sails, and if sailboats can actually be made to function better than what I've been able to do so far!  Turns out YES, but also no.<br /><br />More Best Creations: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRBM4A4H7CY&amp;list=PLjtiR7dM6LgpTs4kxlywYV4nWqdfo5DSl">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRBM4A4H7CY&amp;list=PLjtiR7dM6LgpTs4kxlywYV4nWqdfo5DSl</a><br /><br />Tons More Trailmakers: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwTCzFXIjVg&amp;list=PLjtiR7dM6Lgp2qrCaaHCTjAmW-vC_IO5T">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwTCzFXIjVg&amp;list=PLjtiR7dM6Lgp2qrCaaHCTjAmW-vC_IO5T</a><br /><br />My Most Popular Videos (for whatever reason): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjtiR7dM6Lgrq8bJywkgM8QFsSgeQaWEI">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjtiR7dM6Lgrq8bJywkgM8QFsSgeQaWEI</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Like my Channel?

Explore, crash horribly, use your wits to build a better rig, and get as far as you can with whatever spare parts you find on your way.<br /><br />Welcome to the Ultimate Expedition!<br /><br />Journey over grueling mountains, hazardous swamps, and bone-dry deserts on a distant world far from civilization - it is just you, your fellow adventurers and the amazing, jet-powered hover-buggy you built yourself. Explore, crash your vehicle, build a better one, and get as far as you can with whatever spare parts you find along your way.<br /><br />Trailmakers is about building very awesome vehicles and machines, but you don’t need an engineering degree to get started. The intuitive builder will get you going in no time. Everything you build is made from physical building blocks. Each block has unique features like shape, weight and functionality. They can be broken off, refitted and used to build something new. Individually the blocks are fairly simple, but combined the possibilities are endless.<br /><br />Expedition Mode is the challenging campaign mode of Trailmakers. You are competing in an off-world rally expedition with only a few building blocks to get you started. You must build, tinker with and rebuild your machine to progress. Journey through a big world, overcome deep gorges, angry wildlife and dangerous weather to progress and find new parts that will juice up your machine. The world in Expedition Mode will test your survival skills and ingenuity.<br /><br />Sandbox Mode is where you want to head for an unrestricted, sandbox, vehicle-building experience. Here you can build anything you can dream of, and play around with it in the world of Trailmakers. It is a great place to test out crazy machines, and experiment with the physics engine. With tons of different blocks, hinges, thrusters and interactive vehicle parts - the skybox is the limit.<br /><br />Trailmakers is even more fun if you play it with other people. Build cool vehicles and compete in mini-game modes with your friends or other Trailmakers online. Build a helicopter, send it to your friend, and shoot them out of the sky. Put two seats on a tank, and let your friend control the turret. As we get further in Early Access development Expedition Mode will also be adapted to multiplayer.<br /><br /><br />Learn more about the game on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.playtrailmakers.com">http://www.playtrailmakers.com</a> #scrapman #trailmakers{% endraw %}
