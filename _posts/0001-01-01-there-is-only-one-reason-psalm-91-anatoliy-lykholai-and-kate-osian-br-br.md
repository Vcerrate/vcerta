{% raw %}Anatoliy Lykholai and Kate Osian<br /><br />We have one country that we will defend. We have a dream that our country will continue to be free and will kneel only before the throne of God. We know this war is not only physical, but it’s also spiritual — it’s a battle between Heaven and Hell, Light and Darkness! We do place our hope in God, we see Him as our Defender. He will help us &quot;not fear the terror of the night&quot; (Psalm 91:5). Please, keep praying for God’s peace and courage in our hearts! Pray Psalm 91 with us!<br />I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength. (Philippians 4:13){% endraw %}
