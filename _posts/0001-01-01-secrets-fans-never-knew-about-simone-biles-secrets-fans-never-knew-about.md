{% raw %}SECRETS Fans NEVER Knew About Simone Biles..<br /><br />Welcome back to Sports Dive, today on the channel we are going to reveal to you What you didn't know about Simone Biles. Simone Biles is the most decorated female gymnast ever, with 30 World and Olympic medals. The 25-year-old has won 25 World medals, including 19 golds—the most in gymnastics history. At the Olympic Games in Rio in 2016, Biles became the first female U.S. gymnast to win four gold medals at a single Games. She’s also a seven-time U.S. all-around champion and the first woman to win five World all-around titles, three World balance beam titles, and five World floor exercise titles. She’s hoping to add to the haul at the Olympic Games in Tokyo this summer. Here are 12 more facts from Biles’s fascinating life so far.<br /><br />Simone Biles started gymnastics following a field trip in daycare. The 4-foot-8-inch Biles was born in Columbus, Ohio, and now lives near Houston, Texas. When Biles was 6, she took a daycare field trip to Bannon’s Gymnastix outside of Houston and imitated the older gymnasts. The coaches spotted her talent and sent a letter home to her parents suggesting Biles take up the sport. Biles worked with coach Aimee Boorman through the Rio Olympics, took a year off, and then began training with Cecile and Laurent Landi in October 2017. Simone Biles’s sister also trained in gymnastics. Simone and her younger sister, Adria, were raised by their parents, Nellie and Ron, their biological grandparents who adopted the girls at a young age. Adria also competed in gymnastics and trained alongside Simone until the age of 16. Adria calls her sister “fearless” and told ESPN that when they were little, Simone would jump off a second-floor railing onto a couch one floor below. The sisters look a lot alike, so much so that even though Adria is about 6 inches taller, fans mistook her for Simone at the Rio Olympics so often that Adria finally stopped trying to correct people and let them snap her photo.
