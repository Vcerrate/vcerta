{% raw %}Hello. We are Harriet and Mauro and in 2021 we bought an abandoned smallholding in Castell√≥n, Spain. We are learning how to grow our own food, live more simply and slowly, and little by little build the life we dream of.<br /><br />We usually share videos about the progress of our farm restoration project. Life is not perfect but in this series I just wanted to celebrate some of the little things that bring me peace and joy living here.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Music in this video:<br /><br />Introspective / Gabriel Lewis / Courtesy of Epidemic Sound<br />If I Wrote You a Song (Instrumental Version) / Melanie Bell / Courtesy of Epidemic Sound{% endraw %}
