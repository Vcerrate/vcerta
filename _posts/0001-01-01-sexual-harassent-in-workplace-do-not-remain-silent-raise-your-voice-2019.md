{% raw %}This is an awareness short film regarding &quot;Sexual Harassment in Workplace&quot; we did this as a part of our university's course project. The course was “Human Resource Management (BUS301)” and our course coordinator was “Ms. Arzoo Ismail”.<br /><br />In our everyday life, we have seen a great deal of occurrence of sexual harassment and eve-teasing similar to this film. In any case, most of us, especially women do not challenge or raise our voice against sexual harassment rather we are always either enduring the situation or we are leaving our jobs.<br /><br />Therefore, we should remember that if we stay quiet, we are supporting them. We should have zero tolerance for sexual harassment, regardless of whether the guilty party is someone who is close to us or whom we respect.<br /><br />&quot;RAISE YOUR VOICE AGAINST SEXUAL HARASSMENT&quot;<br /><br /># Casts: Rhysa Ruabayet, Md. Abir Islam, Md. Rahatuzzaman, Amzad Hossain, Jarin Tasnim<br /><br />Stop Sexual Harassment in workplaces at Bangladesh{% endraw %}
