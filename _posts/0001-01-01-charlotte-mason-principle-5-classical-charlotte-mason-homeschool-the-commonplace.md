{% raw %}One of the three instruments in a Mason home is 'the atmosphere,' but our children's atmosphere is created by our personal habits. We need to zoom out (or, as I weirdly said, 'zoom back') and assess our own habits. I like to use three categories to do this: thought, body, and heart. <br /><br />How do you assess *your* habits and build them on truth, goodness, and beauty?<br />_<br /><br />Want to see my daily timetable and learn the why behind our home life?
