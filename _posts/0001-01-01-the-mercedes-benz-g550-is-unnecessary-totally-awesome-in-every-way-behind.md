{% raw %}It’s not very often I get cars that get me this excited. This Mercedes-Benz G550, like every G550, comes with a 4.0L BiTurbo V8, a 9-speed transmission and full time all wheel drive standard, and can go from 0-60 miles per hour in 5.6 seconds. Not bad for a vehicle that weighs almost 3 tons.<br /><br />Outside, it looks pretty similar to the last G-Class, which is a good thing. It still looks tough, and stands out thanks in part to this chrome brush guard and its super boxy design. This one is sitting on 19-inch 5-spoke wheels wrapped in all-season rubber.<br /><br />Hopping inside, we have a pretty spacious interior, macchiato beige and black Nappa leather, and the creature comforts you’d come to expect from a luxury SUV like heated front and rear seats, rain sensing windshield wipers, and a big, bright, easy to read infotainment system that includes both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. All for a base price of $125k.<br /><br />At the gas station filling up: With the addition of a $1400 Adaptive Damping Adjustment to the suspension, $200 all-season floor mats with $90 leather piping, a $2200 comfort seat package, and a $5000 exclusive interior package, this specific G550 will set you back $134,315 delivered. With an EPA estimated fuel economy of 13 city, 17 highway 14 combined, your day to day costs won’t exactly be cheap either. And you bet this Wagen guzzles premium. <br /><br />What that means is the G-Wagen is expensive and exclusive. Sales in the U.S. have hovered around 3-4000 units since 2014, with, if my vacation last week was any indication, most of them being bought by people living in Aspen. The G550 is the cheapest G-Wagen we get, with the G63 AMG starting at nearly $150k and the now discontinued V12 G65 AMG breaking the bank at over 200,000 dollars<br /><br /><br />Autoblog obsessively covers the auto industry.
