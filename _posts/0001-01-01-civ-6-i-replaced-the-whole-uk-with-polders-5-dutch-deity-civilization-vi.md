{% raw %}In this game of Civ 6, we’ll be playing one of my favourite Civilization VI modded maps, Yet Not Another Map Packs Europe TSL. It’s big, it’s cramped, and today we’re playing The Dutch.<br /><br />The Netherlands have a very tricky start and with Deity ++ enabled we’ll be up against it right from the off. Luckily, we’re pirates. So that’s swell.<br /><br />Can we fight for our space in Europe or exist peacefully? I mean, it’s an option, right? Right?<br /><br />All maps, mods and tech support on getting these games to work are available on my discord, so swing by!<br /><br />Make sure you subscribe below so you don't miss more Deity Civilization VI fun!<br /><br />00:00 - The UK Is Not Happy Right Now<br />04:58 - Sizing Up The Next Target<br />10:00 - WOAH - What IS This<br />15:08 - Handy Late Game Aluminium Card<br />19:50 - Is My Geography Just Wrong?<br />24:59 - All Fixed<br />29:52 - Rome Has The Tech.
