{% raw %}Bell Looks To The Future With FCX-001 Vertical Lift Aircraft…<br /><br />Bell Helicopter took the wraps off a very forward-looking helicopter design at Heli-EXPO 2017 in Dallas, Texas, in March.<br /><br />Mitch Snyder, President and CEO of Bell Helicopters, said in his speech while unveiling the FCX-001 that the aircraft represents only a glimpse of what is going on with Bell's Innovation Team. &quot;This isn't a production aircraft reveal,&quot; Snyder said, &quot;but rather a 3-D roadmap for the future.&quot;<br /><br />Snyder said a group of artists incorporated into the Innovation Team challenged the team's engineers to think beyond what would be typical or standard in aircraft design.<br /><br />One of the more interesting design features are &quot;morphing rotor blades&quot;, which Snyder said allows the aircraft to optimize performance in different flight regimes.<br /><br />The aircraft is intended for single-pilot operation with assistance from &quot;augmented reality&quot; and artificial intelligence.<br /><br />The concept aircraft was revealed two months before Bell announced its participation in the Uber Elevate program. While this may not be the bird that fulfills that mission, it's a fair bet that some of the concepts introduced in the FCX-001 will be incorporated into an eventual Bell Uber aircraft.<br /><br />Aero-TV is a production of the Internationally syndicated Aero-News Network.
