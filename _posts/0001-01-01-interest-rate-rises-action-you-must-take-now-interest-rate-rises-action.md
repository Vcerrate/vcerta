Home Owners with a Mortgage <br /><br />USA Fixed rate for 20-30 years, no action needed<br /><br />But for the rest of us outside the USA, we may only be able to get a 5-10 year fixed rate at best<br /><br />Many on variable or tracker - NO! Fix now. 26% of UK home loans are on a variable rates, or 2.2 million mortgages, of which 40% on a tracker.<br />Almost no one has fixed!<br /><br />UK Bank Rate rise to 0.5%, the monthly payment on an average tracker mortgage will increase by £25.76, and the monthly payment on the average SVR (standard variable rate) will increase by £15.96. That’s an additional £309 per year<br /><br />This will only get worse. I expect the BOE Bank rate to hit 1.25% later this year in 2022 - and even further next year<br /><br />Homeowners with £250,000 of borrowing will have to pay an extra £1,956 a year, compared to the start of the year, while those with £450,000 of borrowing will have to find an extra £3,528 a year, or £294 a month<br /><br />Fix your mortgage now, you can still get 2% in the UK on a 7-10 year fixed if you have enough equity, and 3.6% in the USA on a 30 year deal<br /><br />Someone with £250,000 of borrowing on the average standard variable rate mortgage now could save £5,316 a year<br /><br />2. Inflation &amp; Savings<br /><br />USA Inflation is currently 6.8% &amp; UK Inflation is 5.4%<br /><br />But both are forecast to go to 8% in the USA &amp; 7% in the UK by April<br />If you have $/£10,000 saved at 1% interest = £100 interest <br />If you have $/£10,000 saved at 1.5% interest = £150 interest<br />Vs inflation at say 7% means your $/£10,000 = $/£9,300 in purchasing power + the £$100 in interest so £$9,400<br /><br />3. Loans and Credit Card debt<br /><br />Most personal loans are on fixed rates, so you shouldn’t be directly affected by interest rate rises, but you can be inadvertently affected<br /><br />If employers start to feel the squeeze, they usually start cutting costs, and that means staff, or possibly your job<br /><br />Credit card rates are variable, so it depends on the country, they won’t necessarily automatically go up, but many will raise costs to offset the interest rate rises<br /><br />American Express for example, recently announced it would be charging its cardholders more, blaming the rising cost of offering rewards. They are already at a 23-year high<br /><br />Conclusion: Pay off debt! Consolidate debt now! Darker days are coming.<br />Better to pay down debt now, start an emergency savings account and feel more secure.<br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMER<br />This video is for entertainment purposes ONLY &amp; designed to help your thinking, not direct it.
