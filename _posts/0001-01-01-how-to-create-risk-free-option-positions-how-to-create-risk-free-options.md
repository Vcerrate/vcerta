I'll also break down the math of these types of trades so you understand why they become risk-free. Finally, I'll discuss the pros and cons of using this strategy as opposed to simply closing the trade.<br /><br />0:00 Introduction<br />0:39 Normal Bull Call Spread Entries<br />1:50 &quot;Legging&quot; Into Trades Explained<br />2:13 TSLA Trade Example<br />5:10 Risk-Free Trade Math<br />6:18 Loss Potential and Margin Requirement Go to Zero<br />9:25 You Need to Take Risk First<br />10:37 Timing the Second Trade Entry?<br />15:01 Trading In and Out of the Short Option<br />18:37 Overall Strategy Benefits<br /><br />I hope this provides more clarity on creating risk-free call spread positions! I think it's a phenomenal strategy that gives a lot of trade management flexibility. Most importantly, it removes/reduces your loss potential and allows for more profit potential in the trade at the same time. <br /><br />Your margin requirement also goes to zero (or positive in which you gain buying power) which allows for allocation to new trades or withdrawal from the account.<br /><br />Of course, you can always just sell that profitable long call position and exit the trade entirely. If you do want to push for more profits while also taking risk off the table, then this strategy is a great fit for that plan.<br /><br />=== MUST WATCH Videos ===<br />➥ Investors, Don't Ignore Bitcoin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/z2eSKLcaByU">https://youtu.be/z2eSKLcaByU</a><br />➥ My Favorite Options Trading Strategy (Live Stream): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/_dnWTVEsRmY">https://youtu.be/_dnWTVEsRmY</a><br />➥ Options Trading for Beginners: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/7PM4rNDr4oI">https://youtu.be/7PM4rNDr4oI</a><br />➥ The ULTIMATE Vertical Spreads Guide: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mwttDWfDQ9c">https://youtu.be/mwttDWfDQ9c</a><br />➥ Lost $30,000 on a $1-Wide Spread: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rtVFj9nRRDo">https://youtu.be/rtVFj9nRRDo</a><br /><br />=== Preferred Brokerage ===<br /><br />I use the tastyworks brokerage platform for my stock/options trading (or simply investing in stocks long-term).
