{% raw %}The best two-way moments from the awesome Ab Fab duo. Including classics such as 'is it a bee?' and 'why not have a stupidity tax?' A MILLION VIEWS?! Thank you to my fellow Ab Fabbers! I can't believe one of my videos has achieved such a goal! I'm off to drown in Bolly as a celebration.{% endraw %}
