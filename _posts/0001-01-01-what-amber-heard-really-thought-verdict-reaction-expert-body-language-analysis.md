The defamation case brought by Johnny Depp against his ex-wife Amber Heard is ongoing and will likely take weeks to conclude. But what preceded the case? Depp and Heard's relationship began more than a decade ago, and eventually devolved into what appears to have been a toxic marriage. The couple split in 2016, but have continued to battle in court over an op-ed Heard wrote for The Washington Post in 2018, in which she described surviving DV -- without mentioning Depp by name. Depp is suing for $50 million in damages and denies ever being physical with Heard. Heard is countersuing for $100 million and claims she was only ever physically aggressive with Depp in self-defense or defense of her younger sister.<br /><br />Borderline personality disorder is a mental health disorder that impacts the way you think and feel about yourself and others, causing problems functioning in everyday life.
