{% raw %}An unnoticed industry worth two trillion dollars a year is influencing almost every carbon emission. Sustainability solution seeker Solitaire Townsend calls this sector the &quot;X industry&quot; (where &quot;X&quot; stands for influence), and it includes professional services like advertising and PR firms, management consultancies, corporate law firms, lobbyists and more.
