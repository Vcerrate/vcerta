{% raw %}In this Tedtalk Felicia talks about the importance of seeing yourself and others portrayed when growing up and navigating life. She talks about the dangers of telling half a story and how it can shape the perception of yourself and the world. In this talk she shares her everyday experiences and how they influenced her reality and those of many others, while growing up in a world that often seemed to forget about her. It's not only a call for change but also a call for understanding. <br /> Felicia Mukendi-Kalonji is a Congolese creative and entrepreneur from Belgium. The 23-year-old is currently studying Law and Politics at the Catholic University of Leuven. In 2016 she wrote an opinion piece for MO* magazine called “Mijn afkomst staat niet symbool voor mijn IQ”. In 2018 she was a Youth Advisor in the Flemish Youth Counsel for two years and was simultaneously part of the workgroup for education and mental health. After studying at university for a couple of years, Felicia launched the idea of having an African student association in Leuven in April 2019. Seeing the positive response, she sat down with three friends, Bérénice Sunzu, Anatalia Kibonge, and Nozizwe Dube, and together they founded Karibu – a student association for students of African descent in and around Leuven. She became the first president of Karibu up until October 2020. Besides being an engaged student, Felicia is also a singer-songwriter, and she released her first EP called “Reminiscence” in May 2020 This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
