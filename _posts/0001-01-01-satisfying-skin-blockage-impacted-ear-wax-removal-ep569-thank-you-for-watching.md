{% raw %}Thank you for watching our ear wax removal compilation video today. The ear wax extraction featured in todays video was carried out using endoscopic microsuction. This procedure uses a small camera called an endoscope to visualise inside the ear canal whilst a small suction tube is inserted to gently remove ear wax. <br /><br />We can also use other tools to remove hard ear wax, foreign bodies, peeling dead skin or for ear infection removal.<br /><br />All the ear wax cleaning videos you see on our channel are carried out by our ear wax specialist and principal audiologist Mr Rhys Barber.<br /><br />We post new ear cleaning videos every Monday, Wednesday &amp; Friday at 9PM GMT so if you find ear wax removal satisfying please consider subscribing to our channel.<br /><br />Ear wax plays a vital role in ear health. It helps to prevent ear infection and helps with ear cleaning by picking up any dirt or debris that accumulates in the ear canal. Normally this ear wax would fall out of the ear taking any dirt or debris with it. <br /><br />How to remove ear wax? <br /><br />Many people use q-tips/cotton buds for ear wax removal at home this is one of the worst things you can put into the ear as this can lead to an increased ear wax buildup or in extreme cases impacted ear wax. The best way to remove ear wax is to let your ears clean themselves and not to put anything smaller than your elbow in your ears!<br /><br />How do I know if I have an earwax blockage?<br /><br />If you experience a change in your hearing, discomfort in the ear or jaw or a feeling of fullness in the ear canal you may have an ear wax blockage. Our advice is to speak to your Doctor or local Audiologist who can take a look in your ears and assess whether ear cleaning is needed.<br /><br />To arrange an ear wax removal appointment please visit our website: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.audiologyassociates.co.uk">https://www.audiologyassociates.co.uk</a><br /><br />Follow us on:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/audiologyassociates1/">https://en-gb.facebook.com/audiologyassociates1/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2yDzQeM">https://bit.ly/2yDzQeM</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AudiologyA">https://twitter.com/AudiologyA</a>{% endraw %}
