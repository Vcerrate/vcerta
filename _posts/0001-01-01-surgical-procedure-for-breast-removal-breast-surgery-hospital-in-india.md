{% raw %}This animated video gives you an almost real life understanding about Breast Cancer Surgery.  <br /><br />Surgical removal of the tumor is a common treatment for Breast Cancer.  In addition to removing the breast tissues some or all of the lymph nodes are removed. The breast cancer surgery usually takes 1 to 3 hours. The main surgical procedures are Lumpectomy and Mastectomy. <br /><br />A Lumpectomy is done when the tumour is small can be easily removed. When the tumour is a little bigger a Mastectomy is performed. In a simple Mastectomy only the breast tissue is removed. The most common type of Mastectomy is the Modified Radical Mastectomy, in which the entire breast and some or all of the lymph nodes under your arm is removed.  In a Radical Mastectomy the breast, the underlying tissue and all visible lymph nodes are all removed.<br /><br />Know More<br />Visit Our Hospital Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.manipalhospitals.com/">https://www.manipalhospitals.com/</a><br />Visit Our Obstetrics and Gynaecology Doctors: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.manipalhospitals.com/doctors-list/obstetrics-and-gynaecology/">https://www.manipalhospitals.com/doctors-list/obstetrics-and-gynaecology/</a><br />Visit for Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.manipalhospitals.com/specialities/obstetrics-and-gynaecology/">https://www.manipalhospitals.com/specialities/obstetrics-and-gynaecology/</a><br />Contact us @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.manipalhospitals.com/contact-us/">https://www.manipalhospitals.com/contact-us/</a><br /><br />Get Connected Here:<br />==================<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ManipalHospitalsIndia">https://www.facebook.com/ManipalHospitalsIndia</a><br />Google+: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/111550660990613118698">https://plus.google.com/111550660990613118698</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ManipalHealth">https://twitter.com/ManipalHealth</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://in.pinterest.com/manipalhospital">https://in.pinterest.com/manipalhospital</a><br />Linkedin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/manipal-hospital">https://www.linkedin.com/company/manipal-hospital</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/manipalhospitals/">https://www.instagram.com/manipalhospitals/</a><br />Foursquare: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://foursquare.com/manipalhealth">https://foursquare.com/manipalhealth</a><br />Alexa: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/manipalhospitals.com">http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/manipalhospitals.com</a><br />Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.manipalhospitals.com/blog/">https://www.manipalhospitals.com/blog/</a>{% endraw %}
