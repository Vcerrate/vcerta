{% raw %}Learn about the multiple different ways you can gain and maintain exposure on Comb Financial's $COMB token.<br /><br />I discuss the different upside potential and downside risk / protection afforded by the different investment opportunities, as well as the effect of APY on your holding duration.<br /><br />So if you are trying to figure out what to do with your $COMB, HOLD / HODL, put it into a Spiritswap, Comb Financial, Beethoven Farm or Pool, or even an Autocompounder (did you know about Reaper Farm??), this is the video for you. <br /><br />Here is my always free spreadsheet which I refer to in the video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NSCufiwN16tKpvybMt9bbTg9Q14a-9tcQ1_9NB_KW5c/copy">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NSCufiwN16tKpvybMt9bbTg9Q14a-9tcQ1_9NB_KW5c/copy</a><br /><br />It's really important I feel for me to remind everyone that I have absolutely no financial qualifications whatsoever - I studied engineering and I'm just a guy hustling in his mother in law's bedroom trying to figure things out and I really enjoy making these videos and spurring myself on to learn. So definitely don't take anything I say as financial advice please. I think that the way I word my sentences and present the material is extremely neutral and my focus is on sharing how I think about my investing choices. I have many times realised or been told that I missed something out. So definitely call me out in the comments if I missed something and we can both learn together :)<br /><br />#bashfulbearss<br /><br />~~~~~<br />- TIMESTAMPS -<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:47 Intro to the COMB Financial Super Everything (except podz) Calculator<br />01:11 The profile of Investor that is Selling $COMB Right Now<br />03:35 The Broad Categories of $COMB Investment Options and Quick Explanations<br />07:56 Overview of my COMB Financial $COMB Investing Options Calculator, Some Gotchas and HIGHER LEVEL STRATEGIES for those who are Willing to Forgo Short Term Gainz to Help Out the Protocol<br />16:16 Understanding HOW the Different Investment Options Affect Your Profit / Loss Based on (1) $COMB Price, and (2) Investment Timeline. You MUST remember that these calculations assume that the TVLs, zCOMB locked, price of all tokens other than $COMB all remain static in these calculations. This of course is not true in real life but by simplifying the problem statement, we are able to derive some meaningful mathematical conclusions.<br />27:39 Quick Discussion on the Different Levels of RISK Associated With Each Option and how that may affect your investment choice<br />31:50 Considerations into Human Nature and HOW LAZY YOU ARE and how that may affect your investment choice<br />~~~~~<br /><br />- GOOD LINKS -<br />$100K Passive Income Project: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGsiH2KP0kw2CypAt-RiwFgq">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGsiH2KP0kw2CypAt-RiwFgq</a><br /><br />Mother of All Personal Finances Google Sheets Template:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGssG6gfmkVWnevm49DqVOB_">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGssG6gfmkVWnevm49DqVOB_</a><br /><br />Stock Market:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGsqxOG7mZyP_EwYRtBBLp_x">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGsqxOG7mZyP_EwYRtBBLp_x</a><br /><br />Vehicle Ownership:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGsnYAkyuREhz02tQkUxe8yX">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGsnYAkyuREhz02tQkUxe8yX</a><br /><br />Cryptocurrency Basics:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGvv4HXMI-GyZ9dRvxOwOZuD">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGvv4HXMI-GyZ9dRvxOwOZuD</a><br /><br />Money Fundamentals:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGvVcySCCZMN4OFXgWLAhCBW">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGvVcySCCZMN4OFXgWLAhCBW</a><br /><br />Singapore Property Playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGvlaAY_ldob2I5n3zDZIPTy">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGvlaAY_ldob2I5n3zDZIPTy</a><br /><br />DIY To Save Money:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGtVgKNsRTlmMnAGEokxTM5i">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGtVgKNsRTlmMnAGEokxTM5i</a><br /><br />Personal Finances:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGsoi4vbMJ0r67Fzvuk5zZ9c">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGsoi4vbMJ0r67Fzvuk5zZ9c</a><br /><br />Investing Basics:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGvd9d8u4MXHYeitsUwECLMK">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJ_ZgEG9yGvd9d8u4MXHYeitsUwECLMK</a><br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Everything on this youtube channel, Christopher Thong, is not financial advice and is purely meant for entertainment purposes only.
