{% raw %}WHO &quot;원숭이두창, 일정기간 감지 안되고 퍼지다 최근 증폭된 듯&quot;<br /><br />According to the World Health Organization, the sudden appearance of monkeypox... simultaneously in several countries where it's not endemic... suggests that the virus has spread undetected for some time.<br />The WHO said on Sunday that it expects more cases to be reported as surveillance expands in both endemic and non-endemic countries.<br />It added that there could be a serious public health risk if the virus spreads to groups at higher risk of severe disease.<br />As of May 26th, a total of 257 confirmed and 120 suspected cases have been reported in 23 countries where the virus is not endemic.<br />There have been no reported fatalities.<br />Monkeypox is usually a mild disease, endemic in parts of west and central Africa, and can be relatively easily contained through measures such as self-isolation and hygiene.<br /><br />#WHO #monkeypox #transmission<br /><br />📣 Arirang News(Facebook) : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/arirangtvnews">https://www.facebook.com/arirangtvnews</a><br />📣 Arirang News(Twitter) : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/arirangtvnews">https://twitter.com/arirangtvnews</a><br />📣 News Center(YouTube) : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NEWSCENTER_ARIRANGTV">https://www.youtube.com/c/NEWSCENTER_ARIRANGTV</a><br /><br /><br />2022-05-30, 17:00 (KST){% endraw %}
