{% raw %}Hey guys! I'm back with another vlog months after being MIA here. Just finished a rough edit of this vlog about my journey back to Siargao - four months after the island was hit by Odette. ü§ó<br /><br />I wanted to share with you guys what to expect starting from your arrival at the airport, as well as the updated travel requirements. Everything is so easy and seamless.<br /><br />To everyone asking about the current condition of Siargao and if the island is already open: YES, SIARGAO IS NOW READY TO WELCOME AND ACCEPT EVERYONE ‚ù§Ô∏è A lot may have changed in the past months but one thing remains the same: SIARGAO IS STILL AS BEAUTIFUL AND BREATHTAKING AS EVER ‚ú® I really hope you guys can visit soon!<br /><br />SIARGAO TOURS - facebook.com/colztravel ; instagram.com/colztravel{% endraw %}
