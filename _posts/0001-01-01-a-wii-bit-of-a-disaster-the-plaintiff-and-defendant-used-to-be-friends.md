{% raw %}The plaintiff and defendant used to be friends. The plaintiff says she agreed to babysit the defendant’s four kids while she also had her own two kids there. The plaintiff alleges the defendant’s son damaged her TV while playing a video game, so she’s suing for the value of a television. The defendant argues the plaintiff should’ve been supervising the children better, so she doesn’t think she owes the plaintiff any money. She’s countersuing for emotional distress.{% endraw %}
