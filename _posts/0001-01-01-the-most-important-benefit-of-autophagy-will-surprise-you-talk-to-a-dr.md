I’m not talking just about hair and muscle. I’m talking about those little enzyme protein machines that do the work of the body. They’re at the cellular level, and they make body tissue. <br /><br />Benefits of autophagy:<br /><br /> • It decreases the risk of disease<br /> • It will help recycle protein as a survival mechanism <br /> • It can help reduce pathogens in the body <br /> • It protects neurons and heart cells<br /> • It gets rid of advanced glycated end products and amyloid plaquing <br /><br />**The most important benefit of autophagy is anti-cancer. <br /><br />The difference between a normal cell and a cancer cell has to do with this one thing.<br /><br />A normal cell has something called mitochondrial respiration. <br /><br />A cancer cell has damage to this respiratory mechanism. When you damage this system, the cell starts to activate an ancient pathway that’s capable of fermenting glucose without the use of oxygen. <br /><br />Cancer cells are hungry for glucose. Why would anyone want to consume a lot of sugar or glucose if they have cancer?<br /><br />But why is there damage to the respiratory mechanism in the mitochondria? My theory is that it has something to do with the DNA that gets damaged. I believe it gets damaged because it's simply not protected. Autophagy may have the ability to clean up this damage in the mitochondria. <br /><br /><br />Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:<br />Dr. Berg, 56 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.
