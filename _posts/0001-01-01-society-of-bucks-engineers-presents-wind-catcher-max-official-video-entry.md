{% raw %}Official video entry for the NSF Community College Innovation Challenge.<br /><br />The Society of Bucks Engineers showcase the Wind Catcher Max wind tower, an alternative energy solution that recycles water. Its construction is lighter and more transportable than standard wind towers, and it is ecologically more favorable than solar panels that require large areas of land, and wind turbines that kill wildlife.<br /><br />Credits: We want to thank the videography students at Bucks County Community College, along with Gina Andreoli, for their significant role in filming and editing our video entry. We are grateful for their participation and for their professionalism. <br /><br />Patents Mentioned:<br />Owned by Sheerwind<br />U.S. 7811048<br />U.S. 7812472<br />Owned by FloDesign<br />U.S. 7976268<br />Owned by Prof. Dan Zaslavsky<br />U.S. 6647717<br /><br />Google Drive Link Containing Patent Documents, And SolidWorks Files:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B55BDmW-QtatcHhPYXNKa0dLdlk&amp;usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B55BDmW-QtatcHhPYXNKa0dLdlk&amp;usp=sharing</a>{% endraw %}
