{% raw %}Welcome to Solo and Smart. The YouTube channel for adults at risk of growing older alone.   My name is Carol Marak at CarolMarak.com.  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carolmarak.com/index.html">https://carolmarak.com/index.html</a><br /><br />I was in a discussion today on Highway 61, a social platform for seniors. The top concern for several participants was,  “How to compensate for not having adult children and other family members to look out for me—develop a close network of peers and support. Not just friends, I don’t think it’s fair to depend on close friends to take care of me.”<br /><br />Few suggestions <br /><br />Share housing. You can take on a roommate for part or all of the year. But be careful when picking a roommate. It's not so important to connect emotionally or to share your feelings. It's more important to share responsibilities and complement each other so that you can avoid constant conflict. Be sure to fairly negotiate ahead of time not just expenses, but also who will be responsible for what chores and other household responsibilities. But having a roommate might be a good way to look out for one another. <br /><br />Rent out a room using a long term lease check out websites like Roommates.com, Silvernest.com - they have all the resources for vetting a roommate and legal matters. <br /><br />Before you rent out a room - pick up and read:  Every Landlord's Legal Guide, and Sharing Housing: A Guidebook for Finding and Keeping Good Housemates. <br /><br />The National Shared Housing Resource Center (NSHRC) is a network of independent non-profit home sharing programs across the United States. Their goal is to raise awareness of the benefits of home sharing, encourage best practices and cross learning among programs, and to foster the development of new home sharing programs.
