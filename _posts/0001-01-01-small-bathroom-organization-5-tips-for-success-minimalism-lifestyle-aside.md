{% raw %}Aside from the kitchen, bathroom spaces are arguably the most hardworking in any home! Today I am sharing my top tips on keeping them organized and tidy.<br /><br />If you watched my recent home tour video, you will know that we have four bathrooms in our cottage. This is likely over the national average - which may be surprising, considering the home size.<br /><br />We made a conscious decision during the design process to include more SMALL bathrooms - instead of a couple of larger spaces. They range in size from 20 square feet (powder room) to 40 square feet (full bath, including a standard size tub/shower). <br /><br />Though we are incredibly grateful to have these bathrooms, their small size does come with a variety of challenges - especially as it relates to keeping them organized and functional.<br /><br />In this video, I outline FIVE bathroom organizing tips that I have found helpful for our small bathrooms! If you are someone who struggles to keep your small bathroom tidy, I think this will be helpful information!<br /><br />And, I have even more good news! There is an entire Mega Motivation playlist including additional videos on the topic of bathroom decluttering and organization! <br /><br />MEGA MOTIVATION PLAYLIST:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLY9dO87sGSzdeBvPqVGN8_uBm4-iSRCx&amp;nbsp%3B">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLY9dO87sGSzdeBvPqVGN8_uBm4-iSRCx&amp;nbsp%3B</a><br /><br />Happy organizing!<br />xo<br />Angela<br />________________________________________________________________________<br />#minimalist​​​ #simpleliving #minimalismlifestyle<br /><br />Join our family of seven as we establish roots in our small, custom designed forever house - Arrow Hill Cottage. <br /><br />WEBSITE: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.arrowhillcottage.com/​​​">https://www.arrowhillcottage.com/​​​</a><br /><br />I share about simple home + simple living tips.
