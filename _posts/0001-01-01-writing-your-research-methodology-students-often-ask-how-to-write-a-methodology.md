{% raw %}Students often ask how to write a methodology section for a research project. This video describes the structure of a methodology section of a graduate research thesis or dissertation, and for academic publication. My advice: explain what you did and WHY you did it that way. Use evidence to justify your choices. Acknowledge limitations. A good example of a methodology can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00221546.2020.1854605">https://doi.org/10.1080/00221546.2020.1854605</a> <br />If your institution does not have institutional access, an open access post-print can be found here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XXFB7Ze6y6ZfTYYwxA7Jt9S0RZiC7a10/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XXFB7Ze6y6ZfTYYwxA7Jt9S0RZiC7a10/view?usp=sharing</a><br /><br />Copyright Monash University.{% endraw %}
