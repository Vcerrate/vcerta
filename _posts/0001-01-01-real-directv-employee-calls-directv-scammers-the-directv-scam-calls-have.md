{% raw %}The DirecTV scam calls have been making their rounds throughout the USA. On one of those occasions while calling the scammers, I came across an extremely believable sounding AI that scammers were using. So I decided to call up the REAL DirecTV and tell them to call the DirecTV scammers with me. Kudos to this awesome lady, Renalyn, who took my call seriously and tried to escalate it.  Unfortunately, the management were not as good as her. If you are a DirecTV customer, please know that DirecTV does not have a 50% off promotion nor does ATT (no longer owns DirecTV) and NEVER, EVER under any circumstance pay with gift cards.<br /><br />Please make sure to hit the LIKE button on the video!<br /><br />If you'd like to support the channel:<br />Become a Patron: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/deyoclub">https://www.patreon.com/deyoclub</a><br />You can send a SuperChat through here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://streamelements.com/deyotube/tip">https://streamelements.com/deyotube/tip</a><br /><br />***SOCIALS***<br />Twitter: @DeyOClub<br />TikTok: DeyOClub1<br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/deyoclub">https://twitch.tv/deyoclub</a><br />Odysee: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://odysee.com/@DeyOClub">https://odysee.com/@DeyOClub</a><br /><br /> #scambait #pranks #scambaiter{% endraw %}
