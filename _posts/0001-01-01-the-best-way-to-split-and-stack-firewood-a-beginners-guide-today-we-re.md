It‚Äôs probably best to go with what your local oldtimers recommend aimse each area is a little different (soft/hard wood)<br /><br />Make sure that if you are purchasing firewood, that you buy wood that has been split and stacked for over a year. Some less reputable sellers don't stack their firewood and it gets punky or doesn't dry out very well. <br /><br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:40 Types of Firewood to use<br />1:48 Splitting firewood<br />2:28 The best way to stack firewood<br />3:07 Building a wood rack<br />3:26 Stacking firewood and keeping it centered<br />3:58 Putting tin on your firewood<br />4:33 Spacing between your wood racks<br />5:37 Difference between wet and dry firewood<br />6:45 Firewood buying tips<br /><br />#firewood, #Cuttingfirewood, #stackingfirewood<br /><br />Other videos you may like:<br />How to split/stack firewood - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ThTFj-y_qsk">https://youtu.be/ThTFj-y_qsk</a><br />How to milk a goat - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/kqRYLo7bE04">https://youtu.be/kqRYLo7bE04</a><br />How to buy beef - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/oSO0B6apPeg">https://youtu.be/oSO0B6apPeg</a><br />Agritourism/Tiny Homes - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/vuHWSk0aoPE">https://youtu.be/vuHWSk0aoPE</a><br />Intensive Grazing Basics - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/_inRl2cnHao">https://youtu.be/_inRl2cnHao</a>{% endraw %}
