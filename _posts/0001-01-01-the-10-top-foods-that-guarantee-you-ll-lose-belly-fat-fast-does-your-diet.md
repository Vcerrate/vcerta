It causes your liver to make new sugar out of non-carbohydrate sources, such as fat, ketones and protein. <br /><br />If your cortisol is really high, your body will make a lot of sugar. This increase in sugar will elevate insulin, and insulin makes belly fat. Consuming a high-carb diet and sugar, or eating too frequently can also cause your insulin to spike, leading to belly fat. <br /><br />You'll typically notice belly fat after the liver is already fatty because a lot of the visceral fat around the organs comes from a spill-off of fat from the liver. So, the best foods to help you lose belly fat address lowering insulin, lowering cortisol or supporting the liver. <br /><br />Ten foods that help you lose belly fat:<br />1. Eggs <br />2. Salmon <br />3. Cod liver and cod liver oil <br />4. Sauerkraut <br />5. Cruciferous vegetables <br />6. Hamburger <br />7. Avocados <br />8. Broccoli sprouts <br />9. Asparagus <br />10. Nutritional yeast (non-fortified) <br /><br />ADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description">https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description</a><br /><br />FREE COURSE‚ûú ‚ûú <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse">http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse</a><br /><br />Talk to a Dr. Berg Keto Consultant today and get the help you need on your journey.
