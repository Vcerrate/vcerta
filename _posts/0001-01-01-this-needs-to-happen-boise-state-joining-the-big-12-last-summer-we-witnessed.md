{% raw %}Last summer we witnessed madness with college football realignment, and it was all sparked by the shocking announcement of Texas and Oklahoma moving to the SEC. Many wondered whether the big 12 would cease to exist and predictions were made where each Big 12 team was going to end up. The Big 12 was able to survive and keep its member school together without panicking. They would proceed to add BYU, Cincinnati, Houston, and UCF but since then there have been rumors the conference would continue to add more. There were theories on what schools they made add: Memphis, Boise State, USF, etc but a tik tok may have leaked one school that is making a transition.<br /><br />Instagram: @jrobrien<br />Twitter: @jrobrien_28{% endraw %}
