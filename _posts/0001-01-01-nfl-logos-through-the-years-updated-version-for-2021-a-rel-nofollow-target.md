{% raw %}UPDATED VERSION for 2021: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjpHZ3yuoBI&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjpHZ3yuoBI&amp;feature=youtu.be</a><br /><br />NFL teams have all gone through some sort of rebranding, whether it's something as minimal as the Dallas Cowboys putting a blue outline on their now iconic star logo, or the Los Angeles Rams cycling through nine different logos to find the right look for their thrice-moved franchise. Some NFL logos have outlived their time through retro merchandise and, in some cases, fans clamoring for teams to bring back certain logos, like the Philadelphia Eagles' kelly green eagle that the team used as its primary logo from 1948-1968. Other teams just stick with the same logo and only slightly change the coloring every few years, like the Cleveland Browns. Whatever the reason, an NFL team's logo is just as important as the product on the field, because as it turns out fans care a lot about what their favorite team is wearing on their helmets. Just ask the San Francisco 49ers who quickly went back to their current logo six days after debuting a new one in 1991. Fans nearly revolted and the 49ers course corrected back to the logo they have today. <br /><br />SEE BELOW FOR TIMESTAMPS<br /><br />Subscribe to FanSided! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/25PHLV">https://goo.gl/25PHLV</a><br /><br />FanSided is one of the fastest growing network of fandom-focused sports, entertainment and lifestyle sites on the Internet.
