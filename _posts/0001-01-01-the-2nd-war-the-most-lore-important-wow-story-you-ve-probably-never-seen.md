{% raw %}The 2nd war of warcraft is full of important events and characters that are referenced constantly in lore and in game, yet we never see the events unfold in game in any way, shape, or form. So I was glad to get Final Buttress to finally put together a creative re-telling of this lore event in a short 3 hour video using the Tides of Darkness Book as a Reference. <br /><br />Video managed by Felplague<br />Video edited by The Flying Buttress<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFg95TXR5dR13qGq6aC9ng">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFg95TXR5dR13qGq6aC9ng</a><br /><br />Buy the book - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/279508.Tides_of_Darkness">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/279508.Tides_of_Darkness</a><br /><br />--The Chapters--<br />00:00 - Intros<br />00:34 - Prologues<br />13:10 - Chapters 1 &amp; 2<br />23:13 - Chapter 3<br />34:26 - Chapters 4 &amp; 5<br />52:54 - Chapter 6<br />01:03:46 - Chapter 7<br />01:17:35 - Chapter 8<br />01:25:55 - Chapter 9<br />01:30:52 - Chapter 10<br />01:40:45 - Chapter 11<br />01:46:53 - Chapter 12<br />01:52:05 - Chapter 13<br />01:56:54 - Chapter 14 Part 1<br />02:04:14 - Chapter 14 Part 2<br />02:12:21 - Chapter 15<br />02:24:39 - Chapter 16<br />02:33:47 - Chapter 17<br />02:44:52 - Chapter 18<br />02:49:38 - Chapter 19<br />02:54:48 - Chapter 20<br />03:01:32 - Chapter 21<br />03:06:27 - Chapter 22<br />03:15:05 - Outros<br /><br />-Music as it Appears-<br /><br /><br />-- Subscribe to my other channel, The DuelLogs, if you like YuGiOh. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDuelLogs">https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDuelLogs</a> <br />-- Subscribe to my other channel, TheD&amp;DLogs, if you like Dungeons and Dragons. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDDLogs">https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDDLogs</a><br /><br />-- Check out some of my Amazon favorites like what I use to run my YouTube channels, my home gym essentials, and other random stuff I like to buy. www.amazon.com/shop/hirumaredx <br /><br /><br />--Social Media--<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hirumared">https://twitter.com/hirumared</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Hirumaredx">https://www.facebook.com/Hirumaredx</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/hirumaredx">http://www.patreon.com/hirumaredx</a><br /><br />- #WoWLore #WorldofWarcraft #warcraft{% endraw %}
