Most of the cards are reprints from the Sword &amp; Shield Era but have their own collection symbol and number, as well as a &quot;25th&quot; graphic. Of note are two entirely gold Full Art cards featuring Pikachu and a Poké Ball, which feature etching and a much larger 25th anniversary graphic. All standard cards are Mirror Holofoil. Each Japanese or Korean box also comes packaged with five copies of the Promo Card Pack 25th Anniversary Edition, which are replaced with a single pack of 25th Anniversary Collection in Traditional Chinese boxes due to the promo card set not distributed through promo packs.<br /><br />The accessories comprise a set of 64 premium gloss card sleeves, a foil-stamped rubber playmat, a set of 12 metal damage counter dice, a pair of metal Special Condition markers, a metal 25th anniversary coin, a leather-like deck case, a leather-like playmat case, and a leather-like damage counter case. In Singapore, the box was sold through local Pokémon Center, and contains only the accessories with no deck or card packs.<br /><br />_______________________________<br /><br />#Pokemon #GoldenBox #Cards<br />_________________________________<br />Business Email: maxmoefoe@gmail.com{% endraw %}
