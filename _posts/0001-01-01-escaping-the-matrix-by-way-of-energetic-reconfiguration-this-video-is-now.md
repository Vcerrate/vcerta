{% raw %}This video is now going public after over a year of being private on my Patreon page. You can join my Patreon page at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.Patreon.com/SacredSerpent">http://www.Patreon.com/SacredSerpent</a> There you can access thousands of posts that you will never be able to access here on the public Sacred Serpent YouTube channel. <br /><br />This is a very important message and do indeed hope that you can find the time to watch it in it's duration. There are multiple key points brought up throughout this video that if applied and integrated into your life - can allow you to directly experience the acquisition of power. <br /><br />Let us discuss the way of total energetic reconfiguration &amp; the process by which we initiate that great change. Human beings, on a mass level, are currently caught within the nefarious webbing of a perceptual &amp; energetic enslavement program. By becoming aware of this fact, we can access and obtain a reference point, allowing us to actually witness the programming in action. It is at that point, once the reference point is fully integrated into the conscious mind, that we can begin to remold our energetic configuration to suite our own narrative, and not that of the material realm/social construct.<br /><br />In 1976 the US public health department said that only 1 &amp; 1/2 percent of all Americans were actually healthy. That was 46 years ago! Since then, the health has been on a steady decline, and it honestly would not shock me if nowadays less that 1/2 percent of the American population were TRULY healthy. We can thank genetic engineering of food, stratospheric aerosol injections, environmental poisoning such as pesticides &amp; herbicides, polluted drinking water, lack of human discipline, &amp; a myriad of other reasons as to why we are all so unhealthy. Luckily, we have the remedy.<br /><br />Get on a mineral supplement immediately.

We are living in an artificially  induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep. The poor and the  underclass are growing. Racial justice and human rights are nonexistent.  They have created a repressive society, and we are their unwitting  accomplices. Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of  consciousness. We have been lulled into a trance. They have made us  indifferent to ourselves, to others. We are focused only on our own  gain. Please understand. They are safe as long as they are not  discovered. That is their primary method of survival. Keep us asleep,  keep us selfish, keep us sedated.” Bearded Man, They Live){% endraw %}
