{% raw %}I met Dominique while asking people to sing at Hudson Yards in New York City. I usually film outside, but it was a VERY cold day. So I went down to the subway where it is less cold. Visiting from Brazil, Dominique was hesitant to sing at first. but once we started, she gave it everything she had! She seemed to feel happier after singing, and so was I!<br /><br />As a musician, I'm all about creating musical experiences that have people feeling happy and free, and that's why the &quot;Sing With Me&quot; series exists. Since 2018, I have asked thousands of random people to sing with me on camera. A lot of people have said no, some have said no initially but changed their minds to yes, and some have said yes right away. I ask these people to sing with one purpose: to create a way for them to experience a sense of happiness and freedom they did not feel before. And much of the time, this actually works (and that makes ME happy).<br /><br />Would you like me to host a &quot;Sing With Me&quot; at your next private event?
