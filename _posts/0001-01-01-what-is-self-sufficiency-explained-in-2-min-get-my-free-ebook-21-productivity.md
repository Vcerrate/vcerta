For example, The nation can grow enough grain to be self-sufficient.<br />The concept of Self-Sufficiency is good, but itâ€™s not always the best solution to try doing everything by yourself.<br />Because itâ€™s not always the most efficient way of doing things and in the long run it can be holding you back from achieving your goals faster.<br />Letâ€™s say that you want to start a business. This means that you need to design your logo, build a website and advertise.<br />If you wanted to do everything by yourself then that would be taking you a long time and the result probably wouldnâ€™t be so great.<br />The better approach would be to utilise other people skills to get the job done much quicker and with a lot higher quality standard.<br />As you can see there are advantages of being Self-Sufficiency as you can depend only on yourself, but on the downside, you could be doing things more efficiently if you collaborated with others.<br /><br />I hope that you enjoyed this video and I was able to give you a quick summary of what Self-Sufficiency is and what role it plays in our life.     _________________<br /><br />Hi, My name is Janis and Iâ€™m Content Creator and Entrepreneur.<br /><br />One thing that Iâ€™m really passionate about is Time Management.
