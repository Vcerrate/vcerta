(see it here)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DBPCSkuHX_A">https://youtu.be/DBPCSkuHX_A</a><br /><br />Our intention was never to end up in Philadelphia searching for Imbo and Petrone for the next few days for this story really started in 2 hours away in Quakertown, PA where John had convinced us there would be 10-15 cars in a quarry. <br /><br />Turns out the cars underwater in the quarry were only a myth, leaving us with a few extra days at the start of our 2020 road trip across the US to clean up the environment of abandoned and stolen cars underwater along with focusing on missing persons cold case files. <br /><br />With Philly so close, it was a good time to look into the disappearance of Danielle Imbo and Richard Petrone. <br /><br /><br />In this episode of Adventures with Purpose, we located a boat underwater and while we didn't put hands on it, we also spotted on sonar what appeared to be a work van underwater in the Deleware River. <br /><br />So what did happen to Danielle and Richard? <br /><br />Are they two missing persons who ended up in the river?<br /><br />Where they carjacked?<br /><br />What was the crime?<br /><br />Our search continues on Day 2.<br /><br />This investigation into Danielle and Rich‚Äôs disappearance remains open and active, and there is still a $50,000 reward for information on the couple‚Äôs whereabouts or for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for their disappearance. The reward is being administered by the Philadelphia Citizens Crime Commission.<br /><br />Anyone with information that may assist investigators is urged to call the Citizens Crime Commission tip line at 215-546-TIPS (215-546-8477).
