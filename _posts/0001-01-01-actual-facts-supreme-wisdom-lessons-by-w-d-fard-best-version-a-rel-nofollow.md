Despite the audio being around for many years, nobody has taken it upon themselves to create a video presentation along with the audio. Not only has Alam Khan done this, he has also added special annotations for clarification. Even members of the NOI today are confused about the dates in the Lessons, so Alam Khan compiled the breakthrough book, &quot;Supreme Wisdom Lessons: Expanded Edition.&quot; This book sets all the misunderstandings straight regarding the dates of each section and the dates of events described in the lessons by W. D. Fard.
