{% raw %}With a heavy season and crazy year I didn't get the Christmas Cards out so I spent a couple dozen minutes learning the song and then rewrote the lyrics improvisational.  It was a one-take which will be very obvious sine I didn't know the chorus melody and messed-up a few lyrics!{% endraw %}
