Batiks are fabrics that are hand-dyed through traditional processes. She demonstrates using her own fabric collection Heart's Content, and she also discusses her basic rules for selecting a good variety of prints for your quilt by choosing a small print, a medium print, a large print, a stripe and a dot. Following her guidelines, you can blend prints and batiks beautifully and seamlessly.<br /><br />If there is anything you have a question about or would like to see in the future, please comment below.
