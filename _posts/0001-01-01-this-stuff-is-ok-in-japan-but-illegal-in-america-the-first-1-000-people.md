There are some things that are illegal in America, but totally okay in Japan! This might surprise you to hear, since Japan is home to so many strict rules! For example, if a store clerk accidentally gives you too much money back after you buy something and you don’t return the excess, it’s treated as fraud and YOU can get in trouble! But there are a few laws and regulations where Japan is very loose and free compared to America! So let’s see which things are OK to do in Japan, but are illegal to do in the US!<br /><br />MRS.
