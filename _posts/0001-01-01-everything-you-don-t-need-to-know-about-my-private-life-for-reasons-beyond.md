I very rarely use Facebook as a means of communicating with people and I have unfortunately received hostility from people whose Facebook messages have gone unanswered. If you send a voicemail or JW Watch email, and your request is urgent, either myself or one of the team of JW Watch volunteers will attempt to respond. Otherwise, please understand that my time is stretched between my work as an activist and my private life, including my responsibilities as a father and husband. As much as I would like to make myself available to each and every person who reaches out to me, this will only occasionally be possible. I appreciate your understanding.{% endraw %}
