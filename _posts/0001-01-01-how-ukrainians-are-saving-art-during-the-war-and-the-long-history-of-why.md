{% raw %}And the long history of why protecting physical culture matters.<br /><br />Subscribe and turn on notifications ðŸ”” so you don't miss any videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/0bsAjO">http://goo.gl/0bsAjO</a> <br /><br />Despite the fact that itâ€™s a war crime to target cultural heritage, cultural sites are often treated as a second front: looted, damaged, or destroyed as a way for an aggressor to assert power, demoralize an enemy, and control â€” or even erase â€” a cultural narrative. <br /><br />From the very beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, identity has been at the center of Putinâ€™s agenda. And as cultural sites all over the country sustain damage, it is becoming increasingly clear that erasing the cultural and historical markers of Ukraine are a key facet of Russiaâ€™s plan. <br /><br />Ukraine is home to a vast array of visual and material culture â€” museums, monuments, archives, and architecture â€” all of which is at grave risk of destruction, both collateral and intentional.  <br /><br />We spoke with three experts actively working to safeguard Ukraineâ€™s artistic treasures: <br />Dr. Hayden Bassett, director of the Virginia Museum of Natural Historyâ€™s Cultural Heritage Monitoring Lab (CHML) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.vmnh.net/research-collections/chml;">https://www.vmnh.net/research-collections/chml;</a> <br /><br />Vasyl Mystko, director of communications for Lvivâ€™s Gallery of Art <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://lvivgallery.org.ua/museums?fbclid=IwAR2HXxBPUoL7UWtAZ34avtatrSFpKDjyC1r8ghZOAugCUz2-UlSnAGtbKps">http://lvivgallery.org.ua/museums?fbclid=IwAR2HXxBPUoL7UWtAZ34avtatrSFpKDjyC1r8ghZOAugCUz2-UlSnAGtbKps</a> ;<br /><br />and Catarina Buchatskiy, co-founder of the Shadows Project <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://beacons.page/shadows.project">https://beacons.page/shadows.project</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shadows.project/">https://www.instagram.com/shadows.project/</a><br /> <br />Hereâ€™s the link to the Ukrainian Cultural Ministryâ€™s repository for cultural crimes that we mentioned in the video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://culturecrimes.mkip.gov.ua/">https://culturecrimes.mkip.gov.ua/</a><br /><br />If youâ€™re interested in volunteering remotely, Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO) is working to identify and archive at-risk sites, digital content, and data in Ukrainian cultural heritage institutions. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sucho.org/">https://www.sucho.org/</a> <br /><br />Or check out the Network of European Museum Organizations (NEMO).
