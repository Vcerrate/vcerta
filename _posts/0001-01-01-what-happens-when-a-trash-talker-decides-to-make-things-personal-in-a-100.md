GAME OF THE YEAR!!!<br /><br /><br />#abgotgame<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Video Description<br /><br />About my channel <br /> On this channel I hope to one day reach a top 100 ranking in online head to head so that I can start bringing you content against some of the best players in the world. I also hope to eventually start making Ultimate team videos where we will be progressing our team, opening packs, and buying players, and pulling elites until we reach the highest overall possible and reach our main goal of winning the super bowl on in the All-Madden First String Division.(With no money spent)<br />In the past I have made coin glitch videos and videos on the best way to make coins in Madden Ultimate team and I hope to do the same this year with Madden 22.In the future I'm going to make tons of videos that including many different games on the PS5 such as NBA 2K, Madden 22, madden 22 gameplay, madden 22 trailer, madden 22 actual gameplay, MLB the Show, and more. I will also start doing tutorials for Madden, showing you guys the best schemes that i know, both offensively and defensively. My favorite football team is the Indianapolis Colts and some of my favorite players are Andrew Luck(RIP), Cam Newton, Ezekiel Elliott, Tyreek Hill, Antonio Brown just to name a few. Some youtubers that I enjoy watching in the gaming community are flight, flightreacts, oprahside, TDBarrett, oprah sideverson, OSN, Cullenburger, Kaykayes, Kouppa, Toke, Tokenasty, ipodkingcarter ,chrissmoove, QJB, prettyboyfredo, kspade64 ,Kspade kspadetheprospect, pewdiepie  staxmontana, ymdtv, gento subthegamer, stg, shake4ndbake, ryan IKC ,Twobrosgaming, Lostnunbound, mrsomeonegaming ,leparis57, jmellflo, mmg, eric rayweather aiirxjones , chibattamitch , shady00018 ,ernc05 ,callmeshawn ,and ksi. <br />Madden is my favorite game of all time regardless of how much I rant about how bad it is and regardless of how much EA is out to get me.<br /><br />What I plan on doing: I will definitely be doing in depth tutorials of different money plays, glitch plays, and offensive schemes in Madden. Hopefully soon I can bring you guys some defensive schemes as well because I know quite a few “nano” blitzes, and just a bunch of tips and tricks to help you guys play lockdown defense. I do play Madden 21 Ultimate team but the reason why it isn’t featured a lot on my channel is because I got the game late so I was so far behind everything and I didn’t have the time to catch up. But in Madden 21 expect there to be a lot more videos on Madden Ultimate team and Madden Ultimate team pack openings. In NBA2K20 I hope to bring you guys some my park gameplay, maybe myteam badge glitches and hacks, gameplay, signature skill moves, custom jump shot tutorials, Layup Tutorials, archetype tips and tricks, etc.  Stay tuned for many Madden 22 Ultimate team coin glitch tutorials, how to make Madden 22 ultimate team coins fast, and many more tips for Madden 22. I was late to purchasing NBA 2K21 which is why there are no tips and tricks videos that I know for NBA2K 21 yet but just wait on it.Get your Madden Coins here!{% endraw %}
