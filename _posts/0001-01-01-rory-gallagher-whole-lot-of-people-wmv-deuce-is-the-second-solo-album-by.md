{% raw %}Deuce is the second solo album by Rory Gallagher, released in 1971. In contrast with his previous album, Rory Gallagher, which he believed to have a precise, organised sound, Deuce was an effort by Gallagher to capture the energy of a live performance.<br /><br />Recording<br /><br />Original<br /><br />Deuce was recorded at Tangerine Studios in Dalston with Gerry McAvoy on bass guitar and Wilgar Campbell on drums and percussion. In order to capture the feeling of a live performance that Gallagher wanted, he would often record immediately before or after live performances while keeping production at a minimum.<br /><br />Remaster<br /><br />Deuce was remastered from the original master tapes in 1997 by Colin Fairly at Tony Arnold's Courthouse Facilities in Dorset. The remastered album was released in 2000 with the bonus track &quot;Persuasion&quot;.<br /><br />Impact<br />&quot;  There was one day when I was playing along with the Deuce album which<br />was a complete turning point for me as a guitar player.[3]  &quot;<br />   <br />â€” Johnny Marr of The Smiths<br /><br />Track listing<br /><br />    All songs composed by Rory Gallagher<br /><br />    &quot;I'm Not Awake Yet&quot; -- 5:24<br />    &quot;Used to Be&quot; -- 5:06<br />    &quot;Don't Know Where I'm Going&quot; -- 2:42<br />    &quot;Maybe I Will&quot; -- 4:15<br />    &quot;Whole Lot of People&quot; -- 4:57<br />    &quot;In Your Town&quot; -- 5:47<br />    &quot;Should've Learnt My Lesson&quot; -- 3:36<br />    &quot;There's a Light&quot; -- 5:59<br />    &quot;Out of My Mind&quot; -- 3:05<br />    &quot;Crest of a Wave&quot; -- 6:00<br /><br />CD bonus track<br /><br />    &quot;Persuasion&quot; -- 4:42<br /><br />Personnel<br /><br />    Rory Gallagher -- vocals, guitars, harmonica<br />    Gerry McAvoy -- bass guitar<br />    Wilgar Campbell -- drums, percussion{% endraw %}
