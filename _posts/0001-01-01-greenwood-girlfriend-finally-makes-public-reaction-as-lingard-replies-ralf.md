{% raw %}…<br /><br /><br />Jesse Lingard has come out to clarify what the manager said about him being out of the squad. Jesse’s interest to depart the club in the winter window scuppered after Greenwood’s news broke, confirmed by Ralf in his pre-match press conference for the Middlesbrough game. In the same press briefing, the manager admitted that the Lingard had asked for permission to clear his mind before making a return to the side. This attracted some sort of backlash from a section of the fanbase and consequently prompted a quick reply from the midfielder :  “The club advised me to have time off due to personal reasons! But my headspace is clear and I’ll always be professional when called upon and give 100 percent”. So apparently, what Ralf said is contradictory to this, from Ralf, Jesse ask to spend some time off, from Jesse, the club advised him to have some time off. This is a similar thing which had happened between Rangnick and Anthony Martial. Who is telling the truth, a common question posed by United fans ? Greenwood’s ex-partner Harriet Robson has finally reacted after the weekend drama. For the first time after the incident, she posted this on her instagram account “I’m grateful to everyone that has sent messages of support and encouragement- thank you. The last few days has been difficult and I’m taking a break from social media while the police make their investigations” Fellow Red Devils Harriet Robson on instagram.
