The location of the site was a big challenge, as it was surrounded by structures on all four sides with a narrow road leading to the plot.<br /><br />The open to sky courtyard becomes the soul of the house, bringing the outdoors inside the house. The material palette is kept minimal, with a dash of bold colors breaking the monotony of the whites and the greys.<br /><br />Principal Architects Raghuveer Ramesh and Sharanya Srinivasan walk us through this traditional courtyard house that encourages a great sense of communication between spaces. <br />Videography by: Gautham Krishna<br /><br />#MyGreatFacade is a series presented by Fenesta Windows in association with #Buildofy<br /><br />#indianarchitecture #architecture #architecturaldesign #architecturevideo #residentialarchitecture #contemporaryhomes{% endraw %}
