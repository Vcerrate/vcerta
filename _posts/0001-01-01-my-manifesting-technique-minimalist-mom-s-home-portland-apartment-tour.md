{% raw %}Manifest Tip | Minimalist Eco-Friendly Home Tour | Apartment Living<br /><br />Our home has a good mix of minimalism and eco-consciousness! I manifest for myself and my family with this list-making manifestation technique. <br /><br />Our apartment is small - and that's the point! We don't need much space when we're minimalists! Everything we have we use daily, or recently. We aren't boring minimalists - at least not with the things we own!<br /><br />I'll admit. to being slightly materialistic within my minimalist journey, but. it doesn't stop me from running a functional minimalist home. <br /><br />********<br /><br />Check out my other videos on my channel for more tips on minimalism, and living more eco-friendly! <br /><br />********<br /><br />Tiktok: @ samxmiche<br />Insta: /sam0miche<br /><br />********{% endraw %}
