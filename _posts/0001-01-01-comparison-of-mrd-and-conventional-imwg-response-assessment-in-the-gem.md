{% raw %}The GEM-CESAR trial (NCT02415413) investigated a potentially curative strategy for high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma patients, in which the primary endpoint was the achievement of bone marrow MRD negativity, assessed by next generation flow (NGF). Noemí Puig, MD, PhD, University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain, outlines alternative methods of disease evaluation in serum, such as quantitative immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (QIP-MS) and heavy + light chain (HLC) assessment, in comparison with conventional MRD IMWG response assessment by NGF within the GEM-CESAR trial. This interview took place at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2019 Annual Meeting and Exposition in Orlando, FL.{% endraw %}
