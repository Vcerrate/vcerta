{% raw %}In this video, I plunge deeper into defining the first category of speech sounds we call vowels. <br />Three main questions are targeted: <br />1. What is a vowel sound? How it differs from consonants?<br />2. How vowel sounds are produced? Or What are the articulators involved in the production of vowels? <br />3. Whatâ€™s the vowel system of English Language? And how it differs from other vowel systems of other languages?<br />#Phonetics<br />#Vowels<br />#DistinctiveFeatures <br />#VowelSystem{% endraw %}
