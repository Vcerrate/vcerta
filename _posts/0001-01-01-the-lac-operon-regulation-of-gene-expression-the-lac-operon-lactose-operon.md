{% raw %}The lac operon (lactose operon) is an operon required for the transport and metabolism of lactose in Escherichia coli and many other enteric bacteria. The lac operon allows for the effective digestion of lactose when glucose is not available through the activity of beta-galactosidase. Gene regulation (regulation of gene expression) of the lac operon was the first genetic regulatory mechanism to be understood clearly, so it has become a foremost example of prokaryotic gene regulation. This lactose metabolism system was used by Fran√ßois Jacob and Jacques Monod to determine how a biological cell knows which enzyme to synthesize. Their work on the lac operon won them the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 1965.{% endraw %}
