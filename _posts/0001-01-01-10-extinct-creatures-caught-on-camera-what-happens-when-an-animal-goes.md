{% raw %}What happens when an animal goes completely extinct? You don’t expect to ever see it again, do you? Well, maybe, sometimes you are wrong! Although all these animals have been officially declared to be extinct, we’ve seen those rare occasions when an unexpected sighting has been caught on camera. And it changes everything we thought we knew about the animal! Whether it’s a fish that has returned after the COVID-19 pandemic or it’s a creature you’re only used to seeing in fairy tales, there’s no denying some of this evidence is downright scary! <br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ">https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ</a><br /><br />Watch our “10 Terrifying Animals That Are Actually Friendly”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Y5HrprUAuE4">https://youtu.be/Y5HrprUAuE4</a><br />Watch our “10 Celebrity Bodyguards You Don't Want To Mess With”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/0iUbIl2bVDo">https://youtu.be/0iUbIl2bVDo</a><br />Watch our “10 Most Unique Humans In The World”<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/KGvO7P-NgT0">https://youtu.be/KGvO7P-NgT0</a><br /><br />The Chacoan Peccary<br /><br />This pig-like mammal with a long, flexible snout and a coat of gray-brown fur was thought to have been long extinct until the early 1970s! That’s when researchers reported that a living population of this unique creature still existed out there. Sadly, though, the living population is only around 3000 in the world, which makes the Chacoan Peccary super rare and endangered.  <br /><br />The reason why they were thought to have been extinct for so long is that their formerly isolated habitat had completely disappeared, largely due to ranches and hunting. But ever since their re-discovery, there have been multiple conservation efforts in hopes of increasing the number of Chacoan Peccaries in the world, which is great news for animal rights activists! <br /><br />The Coelacanth<br /><br />This bizarre marine animal was thought to have gone extinct along with the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, which probably explains why it looks so primitive! But the year 1938 was a complete game-changer for this living fossil because that’s when the Coelacanth was re-discovered by a South African museum curator, igniting an interesting debate throughout the world!  <br /><br />There are generally two known species of coelacanths. The first is the one that lives near the Comoros Islands off the east coast of Africa and the other is found in the waters off Sulawesi, Indonesia. This animal is pretty much known for its unique characteristics, which, according to several scientists, represents an early step in the evolution of fish to four-legged land animals! <br /><br /><br />Follow Us On Social Media <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► For copyright issues, send us an email at : factsjunkie@gmail.com{% endraw %}
