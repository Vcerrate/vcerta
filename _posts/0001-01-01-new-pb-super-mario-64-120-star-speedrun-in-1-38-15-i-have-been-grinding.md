{% raw %}I have been grinding again for a 120 star time since September 2020 and it feels good to finally to have gotten a PB. Come stop by I am grinding almost every day on my Twitch channel and I feel like I can definitely get 1:37 soon! <br /><br />Analysis:<br />This run is insane up until DDD/FS, and then THI/TTM were rough. Everything else is pretty solid but a lot of room for improvement!<br /><br />merch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simply64store.com/">https://simply64store.com/</a><br />twitch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/simply">https://twitch.tv/simply</a><br />twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64">https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64</a><br />soundcloud ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64">https://soundcloud.com/simply64</a><br /><br />Edited by eriksenchee<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/eriksenchee">https://twitter.com/eriksenchee</a><br /><br />Thumbnail by gleasn<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gleasn">https://twitter.com/gleasn</a><br /><br />Simply pb, also known as Simply pb sm64.
