{% raw %}With over 5000 hours on just Sage on Valorant it's crazy how natural it is to do 200IQ Sage plays and constantly outplay my enemies! If you're wanting to learn how to play Sage at a very high level, simply watch the videos and soak it all in. There's a lot of game sense and outplays that can be taken away from these videos as well as entertaining content inbetween! :D<br /><br />If you’d like to see more crazy plays along with Big Brain Sage walls, check out my Twitch and other Socials, linked down below: <br /><br />S̲O̲C̲I̲A̲L̲S̲<br />TWITCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/flowascending">https://www.twitch.tv/flowascending</a><br />DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/F32YgKsHd7">https://discord.com/invite/F32YgKsHd7</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Flow_Ascending">https://twitter.com/Flow_Ascending</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ivanormous/">https://www.instagram.com/ivanormous/</a><br /><br />When You Have Too Many Hours on One Agent...<br />#valorant #flowascending #sage #200iqsage #bigbrainsage #flowsage #sageflow #onewaywalls #oneway #valorantsage #cft{% endraw %}
