Today's video is about studytube trends: are they overrated or not? I go over trends like pretty and aesthetic notes, iPad pros, stationery collections, notion, bullet journaling, and more! As always, these are my personal opinions based on my own experiences and time as a studytuber, so take everything with a grain of salt hehe :) I tried to give both sides of each argument for and against the trends so you could get an objective view! Hope you enjoy this video and find it helpful!!:)<br />P.S. My main point in this whole video is that for some people cute notes and stationery are motivating and bring them joy, and for some people they stress them out and discourage them. So ultimately there's no real &quot;right or wrong&quot; on any of these trends; it really 100% depends on you, where you're at in life right now, and what makes you happy!<br /><br />links to items shown in video:<br /><br />Paperlike screen protector link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paperlike.com/study2successs">https://paperlike.com/study2successs</a><br />code: study2successs<br /><br />iPad case (pastel blue): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LYJWAx">https://amzn.to/2LYJWAx</a><br /><br />apple pencil sleeve (gradient): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/394ZoUE">https://amzn.to/394ZoUE</a><br /><br />Pressed flower phone case: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3k1mi3n">https://amzn.to/3k1mi3n</a><br /><br />Macbook cover: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3st3vBZ">https://amzn.to/3st3vBZ</a><br /><br />social media:<br />instagrams: @studytosuccess and @estellastudies<br />tik tok: studytosuccess<br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/studytosuccesss?si=K5LVzF6-Qou12AMHVUphIw&amp;dl_branch=1">https://open.spotify.com/user/studytosuccesss?si=K5LVzF6-Qou12AMHVUphIw&amp;dl_branch=1</a><br /><br />aesthetic intro template credit to:  @withloveames on YT<br /><br />I get a small commission from amazon, knewkey, and paperlike at no cost to you (they're affiliate links), so thanks for your support!<br /><br />About me:<br />If you're new, hi, my name's Estella!
