{% raw %}Brutalism - an architectural style that polarizes to this day. It's characterized by raw concrete and a minimalist look that showcases the building materials and structures instead of hiding or glossing over them. The style experienced its heyday in the 1960s and was popular into the 1980s. Today, some think of these gray concrete monsters as the greatest architectural sins of the 20th century and would gladly see them torn down. But doesn't this style still have its very own appeal?<br /><br />#Architecture #Brutalism #Berlin<br />---------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to DW Euromaxx: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/DWEuromaxx_Sub">https://bit.ly/DWEuromaxx_Sub</a><br /><br />Would you like to find out more about Euromaxx?  <br />▸Website: dw.com/lifestyle<br />▸Facebook: facebook.com/dw.euromaxx<br />▸Instagram: instagram.com/dw_euromaxx<br /><br />DW Euromaxx brings you engaging insights into European cultures and lifestyles.{% endraw %}
