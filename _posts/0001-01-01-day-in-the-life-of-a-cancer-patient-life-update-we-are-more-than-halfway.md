{% raw %}We are more than halfway through chemotherapy for breast cancer and wanted to share a life update! Welcome to a day in the life of a cancer patient at home ❤️‍🩹 Thank you to BetterHelp for sponsoring this video. Get 10% off your first month <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.betterhelp.com/eamonandbec">https://www.betterhelp.com/eamonandbec</a><br /><br />On December 21, 2021 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. We embarked on a journey of healing beginning with 8 rounds of chemotherapy. Before chemo began I was terrified of losing my hair, of feeling weak and of becoming really sickly looking but I was determined to remain positive about how the treatment would affect me. Today we are sharing what a typical day looks like for us at home while living with cancer and the harsh effects of chemotherapy treatment. Our life at our cabin in the woods certainly looks different now than it did a year ago (think more napping, less building stuff 😜 ) but I hope anyone going through something similar may find a bit of hope in this episode. Maybe you feel a little less alone. Maybe you learn a new food trick. Or maybe you just take this as your reminder to go easy on yourself. <br /><br />Sending you all so much love and gratitude. Your messages, comments and prayers are felt by us both and we appreciate them all so much.<br /><br />0:00 Welcome to life with cancer!<br />0:38 Best part of the day 🐶 <br />1:50 One week post-chemo<br />3:05 Update on chemo treatments<br />4:24 EXCITING NEWS!!<br />5:19 Morning movement 💪 🧘‍♀️ <br />8:34 How I really feel being bald<br />9:20 What we're eating <br />10:04 Food changes with chemo<br />10:50 Thank goodness for therapy 🙏 <br />12:26 Oso's first One Wheel <br />14:20 Eamon's emotional update<br />17:00 Easy chickpea quesadilla recipe<br />17:40 I saw a naturopath<br />19:58 Q+A from Instagram!<br />24:20 Night time routine<br />25:05 Missing Lee everyday<br />26:51 Dinner 😋{% endraw %}
