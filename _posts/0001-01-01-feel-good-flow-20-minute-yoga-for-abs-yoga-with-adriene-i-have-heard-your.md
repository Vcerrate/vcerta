{% raw %}I have heard your requests. This is a 20 minute Feel Good Yoga Flow to check in with your breath, move your body, regulate your nervous system, and strengthen your core. <br /><br />Some practices tone and strengthen your body (your big, mirror muscles) but leave your nervous system a wreck. This session is intended to do the opposite, allowing you to center mentally and emotionally while receiving that full body flow you crave. <br /><br />Connect to the subtle body, work from a place of integrity, and celebrate your body throughout the process. <br /><br />Let me know how it goes for you in the comment section below! <br /><br />For more videos like this, check out: <br />Yoga for Abdominal Wall: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/RiDhzDhsQU8">https://youtu.be/RiDhzDhsQU8</a><br />Finding Your Center: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rgeTSarKZ8c">https://youtu.be/rgeTSarKZ8c</a><br />Core Power Wake Up: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/k2Aw9vZm_0E">https://youtu.be/k2Aw9vZm_0E</a><br />Total Body Yoga - Deep Core: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/BPobdbmzY9o">https://youtu.be/BPobdbmzY9o</a><br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - <br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è WELCOME to the Yoga With Adriene YouTube channel!
