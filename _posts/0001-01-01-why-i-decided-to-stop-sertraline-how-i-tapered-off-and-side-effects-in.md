{% raw %}In this video I talk about my decision to stop taking Sertraline/Zoloft after two years. I go through my tapering process and how I did it, how it felt and the side effects I experienced. I also discuss in detail what I am doing now to maintain and manage my mental health. It is a long video but I wanted to make sure I took the time to reflect and talk through the different aspects of tapering and why I came to the decision to stop. I hope it helps you with your sertraline journey. <br /><br />Feel free to drop me a DM on Instagram if you would like to reach out. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rishikumar_/">https://www.instagram.com/rishikumar_/</a><br /><br />Check out my mental wellbeing app at<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://joinzeal.co.uk">https://joinzeal.co.uk</a><br /><br />Please like and comment on videos. <br />If you would like to support my channel, you can do so here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rishikumar">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rishikumar</a><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />My names Rishi and I'm based in London, England. After suffering anxiety and poor mental health for two years I decided to take control of my mental wellbeing. It's a ongoing journey and I'm learning new ways to manage it every day. Through this channel, I hope I can inspire people to do the same. You're not alone and it's ok to have bad days, we just need to learn how to navigate them. I am also super passionate about entrepreneurship and self development and I run three start ups.{% endraw %}
