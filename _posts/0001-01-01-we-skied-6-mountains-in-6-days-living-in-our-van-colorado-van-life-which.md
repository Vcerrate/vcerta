We discovered the world of “travel hacking” &amp; became obsessed.  So after 2 years of saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we rean out of money and went home to normal life. We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 <br /><br />#travel #travelvlog #vanlife<br />0:00 Grand finale to winter van life<br />0:48 day 1: Cooper Mountain<br />1:48 our first ski race!<br />5:06 day 3: skiing Breckenridge<br />7:32 skiing down from the highest chairlift In North America!<br />10:48 our favorite green juice!<br />11:52 Kara’s Famous One Pot Peanut Butter Ramen<br />15:56 day 4: Skiing Vail<br />17:20 skiing every open chair lift in Vail and skiing 29,029 feet!<br />24:41 day 5: Skiing Beaver Creek<br />27:13 the rumors are true!!!!! 🍪<br />28:08 Skiing Aspen<br />30:18 we skied the longest run in all of Colorado without stopping<br />32:16 bloops<br />32:48 ANTARCTICA GIVEAWAY ANNOUNCEMENT!{% endraw %}
