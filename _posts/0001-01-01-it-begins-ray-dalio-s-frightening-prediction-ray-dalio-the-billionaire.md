{% raw %}Ray Dalio. The billionaire and former hedge fund manager has been all over the news promoting his new book called &quot;The Changing World Order&quot;. An alarming summary of world history that essentially hints at the fact that the United States is in a transition period, headed downhill in terms of its power and status on the world stage. Although not expecilictliy stating it, Dalio concludes that various factors are pushing the US in the wrong direction. A deadly cycle that started with absurd money printing, and will likely end with internal and external conflict.{% endraw %}
