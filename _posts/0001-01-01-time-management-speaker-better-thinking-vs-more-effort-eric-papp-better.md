I wasn’t making any progress.<br /><br />I had quickly fallen into the fallacy of doing.<br /><br />The more I do, the more I’m worth. I feel guilty when I’m not doing something.<br /><br />Sound familiar?<br /><br />There had to be a better way to work smarter and get back to the enjoyment of working out. I wanted to feel like I was winning again.<br /><br />Then I started working with Kettlebells, the epitome of an 80/20 solution.<br /><br />When 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts<br />When 80% of your revenue comes from 20% of your clients<br />When 80% of your problems come from 20% of the people you know<br /><br />You get the idea…<br /><br />New inspiration was beginning to breathe into me; I finally felt like I was winning again, making progress and accomplishing results.<br /><br />We love complexity and addition. But when we simplify and subtract, we start to produce at a higher level.<br /><br />We breakthrough our ceiling of diminishing returns, where increased effort/time does not produce a higher level of output.<br /><br />I see the mistakes I was making. We overtrain and overcomplicate.<br />We try to do it all. We are on information overload and have no sense of what matters.<br /><br />Kettlebell Thinking – or the 80/20 Principle – has become my belief, my work, and my way of life.<br /><br />With that, I free people from the confusion and busyness that arises in living in a complex world.<br /><br />Formal Bio:<br /><br />Eric Papp is the founder of Agape Leadership, LLC an intellectual capital firm focusing on leadership for business productivity.<br /><br />Since 2010 he has worked with thousands of managers and is evaluated as one of the top management’s trainers in North America.<br /><br />He is the author of Leadership By Choice published by John Wiley and Sons and 3 Values of Being An Effective Person.<br /><br />He received his B.A. from the University of Notre Dame. He lives in Tampa, FL with his wife Brieann and their dog Gracie.<br /><br />In his spare time, Eric is active at his church and practicing the kettlebell.{% endraw %}
