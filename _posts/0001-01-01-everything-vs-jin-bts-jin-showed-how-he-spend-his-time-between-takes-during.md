{% raw %}Jin showed how he spend  his time between takes during filming. In particularly,  we can see Jin and BTS member involves  kicking, and pestering each other every chance they get!<br />With his endless energy, any time is the right time to play fight.He also has to battle with bugs, the weather, and so on. It's fascinating to see him fight like that. After watching this video, I hope you will adore Jin even more.<br /><br />#bts #ë°©íƒ„ì†Œë…„ë‹¨ #é˜²å¼¾å°‘å¹´å›£ #2022 #jin #everythingvsjin #btsjin <br /><br />About: <br />Hello, everyone!
