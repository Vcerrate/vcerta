And there are trillions more in the galaxy and beyond, each with their own unique story, some stranger than fiction.  One day, these worlds may become not just a distant point of light, but a destination.<br /><br />THE SIGHTS OF SPACE is an interstellar road trip to the most amazing places we have discovered in our galaxy, as well as some stops to speculative worlds we think will exist, to see up close the wildest, weirdest destinations in the universe.  <br /><br />I invite you to come discuss this new project at my discord server: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://discord.gg/melodysheep.">http://discord.gg/melodysheep.</a>  As the film is still being written, I welcome any suggestions for places to feature in this journey.<br /><br />You can also follow along on <br />instagram: @melodysheep_ <br />and twitter: @musicalscience<br /><br />Peace and love,<br /><br />melodysheep{% endraw %}
