{% raw %}This is a bonus and impromptu update on onlyplants store, containing very revealing information about our operation and some thoughts on the current plant market in Indonesia. I have actually not visited my own nursery in 2 months due to hectic work scheldule and tons of work travelling. I share my uncertainties about the future of the store, as I troubleshoot/rescue and propagate some plants.{% endraw %}
