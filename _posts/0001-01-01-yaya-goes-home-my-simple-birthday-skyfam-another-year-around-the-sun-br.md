{% raw %}Another year around the sun. <br /><br />32 seemed so far away when I was a teen, but strangely, now that I’m here, it feels comfortable and exactly where I need to be. My birthday is another reason to celebrate amidst all the stress and panic happening around us right now, and I’m so grateful to have the opportunity. For most of us, it’s been a struggle the past few months. But in spite of it all, we are alive, healthy, happy and grateful. <br /><br />If theres anything I learned in the past 2 years, it’s that family is EVERYTHING. At the end of the day, when all is said and done, we will turn to our families for comfort and security and for peace and love.<br /><br />Hope you guys enjoy this simple birthday celebration vlog! So many cute scottie boo moments as per ushe. He’s growing so fast and making us laugh every single day! Hope this brightens up your day/week/month/year!<br />---<br />Music from EPIDEMIC SOUND: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/38jRSq">http://share.epidemicsound.com/38jRSq</a><br />(free 30 day trial with link above!)<br /><br />Follow ME:<br />www.kryzuy.com<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/kryzzzie">http://instagram.com/kryzzzie</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/kryzzzie">http://twitter.com/kryzzzie</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/kryzzzie">http://facebook.com/kryzzzie</a>{% endraw %}
