{% raw %}Do you find yourself drifting when painting?  Perhaps you are like me, and have a short attention span, making it sometimes difficult to commit to a full painting, or maybe you simply don't have the time.  In this super easy painting tutorial, I will show you how to paint this sweet little rose with watercolour, whatever your painting ability and it really shouldn't take very long.  I even provide you with a line drawing to trace down as well as a reference photo to work from.  You won't need many paints either, so find time for yourself and settle down for some stress-free painting.<br /><br />EQUIPMENT USED FOR THIS TUTORIAL:<br /><br />PAINTS:  Black, green-greyb, olive green, permanent red, crimson lake - use what you have!<br />These are by Mungo)<br />(I have used plenty of water with these colours to achieve the subtle, muted tones)<br /><br />PAPER:  I used Arches Hot Pressed 300 gsm (use what you have)<br /><br />And a selection of spotter brushes - these have shorter points and I believe make the application easier - see below for my affiliate link - but any brushes will do<br /><br />Watercolour Mixing Chart:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/T01klbwz65Y">https://youtu.be/T01klbwz65Y</a><br /><br />TOOLS THAT I RECOMMEND<br /><br />BRUSHES:<br />Red Dot Spotters<br />*All Rosemary &amp; Co (short-handled)<br />Sizes I use:  0, 2, 3, 4 and 6<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/reddotspotter">http://bit.ly/reddotspotter</a><br /><br />This is the brush I use to remove errors<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/flatsythenticbrush">https://bit.ly/flatsythenticbrush</a><br /><br /><br />PAINTS:<br />A good all-round pro set   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/jacksonsshchminckesets">https://bit.ly/jacksonsshchminckesets</a><br /><br />PATREON SITE<br />If you enjoy this video and would like to learn more about BOTANICAL ART, then head over to our Patreon site where you will find in-depth tutorials as well as photo editing where I show you how I prepare photos for painting (depending on your tier level).
