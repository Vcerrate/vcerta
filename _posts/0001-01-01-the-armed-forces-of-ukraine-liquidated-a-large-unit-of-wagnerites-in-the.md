{% raw %}The Armed Forces of Ukraine liquidated a large unit of &quot;Wagnerites&quot; in the Donbass.<br /><br />Defenders of Ukraine destroyed a large unit of &quot;Wagnerites&quot; in the Donbass. After the liquidation of the &quot;elite&quot; troops of the Russian Federation, the &quot;ordinary&quot; invaders are afraid to fight the Ukrainian army.<br /><br />This is evidenced by a telephone conversation that was intercepted by the Security Service of Ukraine. In it, the occupier tells his wife how Ukrainian soldiers defeated a Wagner special forces unit on one of the lines.<br /><br />“Where the frontier needs to be taken, how many PMCs were driven there ... But there is no sense in these PMCs! They all died there, these PMCs. This is a trained special forces! They all died. he said.<br /><br />In response, his wife advised the Russian military to &quot;send&quot; the Russian authorities with &quot;their army.&quot;<br /><br />“Absolutely correct advice. And one of the ways to leave the occupying army is to call the SBU hotline and surrender.<br /><br />In another intercepted conversation, the Russian occupier admitted that the command had left them without support. As a result, the invaders in the Kherson region are forced to eat dogs.{% endraw %}
