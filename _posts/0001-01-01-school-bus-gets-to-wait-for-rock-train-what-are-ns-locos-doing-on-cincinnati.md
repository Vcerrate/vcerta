{% raw %}Bus Arrives At Railroad Crossing Just As A Huge Rock Train Is Coming!  What Are Norfolk Southern Locomotives Doing On This Railroad Line?  Train Stops In Mount Orab.  A school bus gets to the railroad crossing in Sardinia, Ohio just as a Cincinnati Eastern Railroad train is coming.  Lucky kids!  This is a short train chase from Mount Orab, Ohio to Sardinia, Ohio.  First we see the train stop in Mount Orab.  It only stopped for a minute and then went to Sardinia.  A railroad official got on the train for a minute and then got off.  Then a lucky bus gets to wait for the train in Sardinia.  Next, we see a little railroad switching on the east end of Sardinia.  They needed to get a car out of the siding and a couple of NS locomotives were in the way.  That was pretty cool to see the NS locomotives go back and forth over the crossing.  That was common until about 8 years ago of course.  But it was an interesting scene to see 4 locomotives moving on the main line.  Last scene is the train going behind an abandoned church just west of Macon, Ohio.  Filmed March 21, 2022<br />           Thanks for watching!
