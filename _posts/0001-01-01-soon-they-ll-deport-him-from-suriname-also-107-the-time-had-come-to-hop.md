{% raw %}The time had come to hop the border from Guyana to Suriname.  The only problem being that there's a large river separating the two countries, so you need a boat.  I decided to record my journey from eastern Guyana on the ferry all the way to the capital of Paramaribo in Suriname, and this is the result.  I had the great fortune of meeting some interesting characters along the way.<br /><br />--------<br />Instagram: tommyelforastero<br />Patreon: www.patreon.com/sabbaticaltommy?fan_landing=true<br /><br />#sabbatical #guyana #suriname{% endraw %}
