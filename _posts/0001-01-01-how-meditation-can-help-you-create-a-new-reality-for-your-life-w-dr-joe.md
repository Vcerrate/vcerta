{% raw %}PREORDER THE POWER OF ONE MORE HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thepowerofonemore.com/">https://thepowerofonemore.com/</a><br /><br />Your BRAIN is the most powerful organ in your body.  <br /><br />Brain function is the most studied and, in some ways, least understood part about us.  It continues to AMAZE, MYSTIFY, CHALLENGE, and ASTONISH us every day.<br /><br />Knowing all this, it‚Äôs surprising we don‚Äôt spend a lot more time on our BRAIN HEALTH, taking every step we can to better understand how our brain works and how it impacts every part of our life.<br /><br />This week, I‚Äôm welcoming back a bonafide EXPERT on how our BRAINS FUNCTION for another engaging exchange.  DR. JOE DISPENZA has traveled to more than 33 countries to give lectures on discovering the full potential of the human brain and has three New York Times bestselling books to his name.<br /><br />He has devoted much of his life to studying neuroscience and neuroplasticity, quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) measurements, epigenetics, mind-body medicine, and brain/heart coherence.  <br /><br />Don‚Äôt let those words intimidate you.  It all boils down to Dr. Dispenza digging into the INNER WORKINGS OF WHAT GOES ON INSIDE YOUR HEAD.<br /><br />Do you want to know how STRESS affects the relationship between your HEART AND BRAIN?<br /><br />Or why you cling on to the SUFFERING in your life instead of EXPLORING THE UNKNOWN?<br /><br />Are you curious how athletes gain a MENTAL EDGE to compete at the highest levels?<br /><br />What are the benefits to having all parts of your brain on the same ‚Äúwavelengths‚Äù so that BRAIN COHERENCE works in your favor?<br /><br />Dr. Dispenza has powerful INSIGHTS to help you shed unwanted thoughts and mental roadblocks using proven science-based research.  You will discover how to replace what‚Äôs holding you back with CLARITY, INTENTIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS, and POSITIVE EMOTIONS.<br /><br />This isn‚Äôt an hour spent talking about theories.  It‚Äôs an hour of DOWNLOADABLE AND TEACHABLE STRATEGIES that will fortify how you think so you can change your life for the better.<br /><br />Get ready because Dr. Joe is about to ‚ÄúDISPENZA‚Äù a lot of practical advice‚Ä¶<br /><br />‚Ä¶and give your brain a lot of important things to think about.<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />1:41 What Joe is working &amp; excited about<br />5:24 How stress causes the heart and brain to be incoherent<br />8:40 Moving from Beta, Alpha, Theta, to Gamma state<br />14:29 Clinging onto suffering rather than the unknown<br />16:01 Demystifying the present moment &amp; rewiring your brain<br />22:30 What happens when you have a coherent heart &amp; brain<br />25:23 What is heart coherence?<br />27:33 Athletes having a mental edge<br />29:13 Creating from field instead of matter<br />35:11 Turning your adversities into wisdom<br />39:52 You don't really want material things, you want the emotion they bring<br />42:05 Brain and heart coherence is teachable<br />46:57 What Dr Joe Dispenza would recommend to people wanting to change their life<br /><br />#joedispenza #meditation #createanewreality #lawofattraction #letgoofanxiety #letgoofstress #selflove #trainyourbrain<br />----<br /><br />Thank you for watching this video‚ÄîPlease Share it and get the word out! <br />What part of this video resonated with you the most?
