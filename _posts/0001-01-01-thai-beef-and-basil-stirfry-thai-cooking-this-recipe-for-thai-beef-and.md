The key to this dish is using the freshest ingredients you can get your hands on, so if you can’t find the Thai Holy basil, use your local basil, as it will bring some impressive aroma to your finished meal.<br /><br />250 g of beef, sliced skirt steak or ground<br />1 red chili, roughly chopped<br />3 garlic cloves, roughly chopped<br />1 tbsp fish sauce<br />1 tbsp soy sauce<br />1 tbsp oyster sauce<br />1 cup of fresh basil leaves<br />1 large chili sliced<br />1 handful of green beans<br />canola oil for cooking<br /><br />Start by pounding up a roughly chopped red chili pepper and 3 cloves of garlic in a mortar and pestle with a pinch of kosher salt til they release their oils and fragrance. The coarse grain of the salt will help season as well as provide some texture while you pound the chile and garlic.<br /><br />Next, in a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon each of soy sauce, fish sauce and oyster sauce. Mix well and set aside.<br /><br />In a wok or frying pan heat up 1 tablespoon of oil on high til it starts to smoke, then add the chilli garlic mix. Stir well for about a minute until it starts to smell really fragrant. Add 250g of sliced skirt steak and keep everything moving as you continue cooking for another minute. Next, add the sauce mixture and combine.<br /><br />Next, stir in a handful of green beans (or long beans) and a sliced chili pepper. Finish off with adding 1 cup of fresh basil leaves. Mix to combine, then give a final taste. You shouldn’t need salt since you have fish sauce, but if it’s a little too spicy, balance it out with a touch of palm or brown sugar. When it’s tasting perfect, plate up on a fresh bed of steamed rice and top with a crisp fried egg if you have them.<br /><br /><br /><br />Music: &quot;Cherubs&quot; by Josh Woodward (www.joshwoodward.com){% endraw %}
