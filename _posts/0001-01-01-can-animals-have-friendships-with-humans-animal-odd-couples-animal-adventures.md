{% raw %}Wildlife biologist Liz Bonnin sets off on a worldwide journey of discovery to find out why animals of different species make friends with each other, and even fall in love.<br />Wildlife biologist Liz Bonnin goes on a journey of discovery to find out the science behind unusual interactions in the animal kingdom. Some of the surprising associations include a polar bear befriending huskies, a cat mothering ducklings, and an orangutan who keeps a pet dog. These odd pairings are not just limited to different species; animal relationships with humans are also explored, as people have been known to keep exotic pets such as lions, hippos and buffalos. Bonnin investigates the root of the affectionate connections and tries to uncover the reasons for the behaviours. <br />Some people have sought out unusual, and even potentially dangerous relationships, with some very surprising animals.&quot;<br /><br />Content licensed by: DRG<br /><br />Any queries, please contact us at: owned-enquiries@littledotstudios.com{% endraw %}
