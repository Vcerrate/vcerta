{% raw %}In this episode, I discuss the profound effect the gut has on the nervous system. I cover the structure and function of the gut-brain axis and the role of the gut microbiome in the brain and overall health. I describe how the gut controls hunger or satiety by affecting neurons in our brain. I also contrast the many pathways by which the gut influences the brain: direct vs. indirect pathways, chemical vs. mechanical, and fast vs. slow signaling. Additionally, I discuss what defines a healthy microbiome and how your lifestyle impacts the gut microbiome, including the effects of stress, fasting, antibiotics, pets, environment, prebiotics and probiotics. I address how different foods shape the gut microbiome, in particular, the emerging data that fermented foods can increase the diversity of healthy gut microbiota.  Throughout the episode, I explain peer-reviewed and textbook findings that reveal the critical role of the gut microbiome in supporting mental and physical health and I outline simple tools that anyone can use in order to enhance their gut microbiome health.<br /><br />#HubermanLab #GutHealth #Microbiome<br /><br />Thank you to our sponsors<br />AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a> <br />LMNT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drinklmnt.com/huberman">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a> <br />InsideTracker: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a><br /><br />Our Patreon page<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman">https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman</a><br /><br />Supplements from Thorne<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thorne.com/u/huberman">https://www.thorne.com/u/huberman</a><br /><br />Social &amp; Website<br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab">https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hubermanlab">https://twitter.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab">https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.com">https://hubermanlab.com</a><br />Newsletter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network">https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network</a><br /><br />Article Links<br />&quot;The Emerging Biology of Gut-Brain Sensory Transduction&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3HruBiE">https://bit.ly/3HruBiE</a><br />&quot;Mechanisms Underlying Microbial-Mediated Changes in Social Behavior in Mouse Models of Autism Spectrum Disorder&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3hmq5Y2">https://bit.ly/3hmq5Y2</a><br />&quot;Association of Loneliness and Wisdom With Gut Microbial Diversity and Composition: An Exploratory Study&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3spfYs2">https://bit.ly/3spfYs2</a><br />&quot;Emotional well-being and gut microbiome profiles by enterotype&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.nature.com/3tcLKYp">https://go.nature.com/3tcLKYp</a><br />&quot;Brain fogginess, gas and bloating: a link between SIBO, probiotics and metabolic acidosis&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/33YlsR9">https://bit.ly/33YlsR9</a><br />&quot;Gut-microbiota-targeted diets modulate human immune status&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3vlkQQD">https://bit.ly/3vlkQQD</a><br />&quot;The preference for sugar over sweetener depends on a gut sensor cell&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.nature.com/33X9zuA">https://go.nature.com/33X9zuA</a><br /><br />Book Links<br />&quot;The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything and Living the Good Life&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hqxkP0">https://amzn.to/3hqxkP0</a><br /><br />Timestamps<br />00:00:00 Gut Microbiome  <br />00:03:02 AG1 (Athletic Greens), LMNT, InsideTracker <br />00:06:55 Your Gut-Brain Axis <br />00:09:44 Gut-Brain Anatomy<br />00:15:32 Microbiota vs. Gut Microbiome <br />00:20:01 Roles of Gut Microbiome <br />00:23:03 Neuropod Cells: (Subconscious) Tasting with Your Stomach <br />00:34:13 Ghrelin: Slow Modulation of Your Brain in Hunger<br />00:38:02 Glucagon Like Peptide 1; GLP-1 <br />00:42:22 Tools: ‘Free Will’ &amp; Food Cravings <br />00:44:46 Mechanical Cues from Gut to Brain<br />00:49:05 Dopamines, Vomiting <br />00:52:06 Indirect Signals from Gut Microbiota<br />00:59:30 Gut Microbiome “Critical Periods”  <br />01:03:08 How Gut Health Controls Overall Health <br />01:12:25 What is a Healthy Gut Microbiome?<br />01:15:00 Tools: Enhance Your Gut Microbiome<br />01:23:49 Foods to Enhance Microbiota Diversity; Fermented Foods <br />01:37:07 High-Fiber Diets &amp; Inflammation<br />01:40:58 Artificial &amp; Non-Caloric Sweeteners <br />01:44:27 Structure &amp; Function of Gut-Brain Axis <br />01:49:47 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify, Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Patreon, Thorne, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter <br /><br />Please note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.
