{% raw %}In 1967, whilst engaged in operations in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam War, the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal suffered a devastating fire and series of chain-reaction explosions that killed 134 sailors and injured 161 after an electrical anomaly discharged a Zuni rocket on the flight deck.  The damage exceeded US$72 million (equivalent to $509 million today) not including the damage to aircraft.{% endraw %}
