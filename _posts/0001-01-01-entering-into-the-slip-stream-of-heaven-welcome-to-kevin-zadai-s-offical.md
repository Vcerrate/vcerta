{% raw %}Welcome to Kevin Zadai's Offical Youtube Page! <br /><br />Dr. Kevin L. Zadai is dedicated to training Christians to live and operate in two realms at once— the supernatural and the natural. At age 31, Kevin got a second chance at life and received a revelation that he could not fail because it’s all rigged in our favor! In 2016, after Kevin retired from 29 years of working for Southwest Airlines, the Lord released him to begin a public ministry. He and his wife Kathi have been called to activate the body and impart kingdom truths to believers worldwide. Kevin and Kathi are moved with great compassion for God’s people and seek opportunities to bless children, widows, single mothers, and others in need. Warrior Notes reflects Kevin’s intimate relationship with the Lord and desire to see His will accomplished on the earth. <br /><br />Become a Warrior Notes Partner and enjoy these exclusive benefits: <br /><br />Monthly email newsletter with an exclusive video from Kevin and Kathi.<br />Access to an exclusive Partner page with free digital downloads<br />Warrior Notes School of Ministry discount<br />Access to exclusive programming on the Warrior Notes TV app ($20/month average minimum donation)<br />To become a Partner: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kevinzadai.com/partnership">https://www.kevinzadai.com/partnership</a><br /><br />School of Ministry<br />We are excited to announce that Kevin Zadai's online School of Ministry is accredited!
