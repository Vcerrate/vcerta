{% raw %}Hi toodledoos ❤️ This week I’m sharing a vlog - a “week in my life”. Every time I finish recording a week of activity, I try and look back and identify a theme…..this week the theme was a lot of intense emotion. The biggest event this week, was revisiting something that's haunted me for years. A also talk a bit about dating (and most why I cannot talk about dating..), work-life balance, and hanging with my family! I’m excited for you guys to be introduced to the obscene and unreal collection of fictional characters that I call my family members. They’re truly the best, and they are very much a part of who I am. (Notably missing my little sister though! She still needs to make her vlog debut :) Feeling a bit overwhelmed this week, but grateful that you always cheer me up.<br /><br />love and chaos, <br />Caroline<br /><br />***<br /><br />[contact: business inquiries only]<br />contact@carolinewinkler.com<br /><br />(I'm so sorry I'm not able to take on any new interior design projects at the moment, however I will share when my schedule opens up!) <br /><br />[about me] <br />name: caroline (angelica)<br />instagram: @thegoodsitter<br />location: washington dc<br /><br />***<br /><br />#weekinmylife #livingalone #workfromhome #interiordesign #dayinmylifevlog{% endraw %}
