You'll never catch me being in my feelings over something someone said. I wrote this song because ever since I started doing music and it becoming a real thing, people who have no idea who I am always have something to say about me. They say I've changed and that I'm full of myself, but I honestly just love myself.&quot; <br /><br />Love you guys and thanks for all your support!
