{% raw %}Pre-order our debut album &quot;Rakshak&quot; here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/BloodywoodOfficial">https://linktr.ee/BloodywoodOfficial</a><br /><br />Aaj is a song about the moment in time when you realise you have the strength to do what you have to do to become who you want to become. We all have our demons, our reasons to be stuck in a rut of harmful patterns and our fears of trying something new. This track is meant to act as a spark to light a fire within the listener to overcome all of that, it's about the fearless pursuit of the next level for as long as your heart continues to beat. <br />It marks the first occasion where the band has combined the Indian flute with electronic elements as well as the usual dose of heavy riffs, diabolical growls and powerful rap verses.<br /><br />Female vocals by The Snake Charmer (Archy J){% endraw %}
