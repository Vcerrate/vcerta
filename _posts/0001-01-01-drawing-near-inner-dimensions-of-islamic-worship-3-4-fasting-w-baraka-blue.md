{% raw %}This series explores the inner dimensions of the Five Pillars of Islamic spiritual practice. Far from simply being outward obligations these practices constitute a method of spiritual awakening that, if practiced properly, lead to an opening of the eye of the heart and an experiential knowledge of God. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, informed his companions that these practices are divinely gifted to humankind as an invitation to draw near to God until the Divine Reality becomes, as the hadith puts it, “the seeing through which you see and the hearing through which you hear.” In other words, these practices lead to an enlightenment of the heart and an awakening to the Divine Presence.<br /><br />This course will explore what has been transmitted from the saints and sages of Islam about the inner dimensions of the Five Pillars. This class is for anyone interested in deepening their spiritual practice, whether people curious about Islam, new Muslims, or longtime practitioners of the path. With Ramadan less than a month away, it will also serve as a preparation for making the most of the Holy Month. <br /><br />Session 1: Witnessing Divine Unity &amp; Messengership (Shahada)<br /><br />Session 2: Prayer (Salat)<br /><br />Session 3: Fasting (Sawm)<br /><br />Session 4: Almsgiving &amp; Pilgrimage (Zakat &amp; Hajj)<br /><br />The playlist for all sessions in this series is available here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh1AWgpd-g8&amp;list=PLyymBzXpAblmwaGrA75_4qOsSiOWv7LMv">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh1AWgpd-g8&amp;list=PLyymBzXpAblmwaGrA75_4qOsSiOWv7LMv</a>{% endraw %}
