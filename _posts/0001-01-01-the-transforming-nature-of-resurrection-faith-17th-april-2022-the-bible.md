{% raw %}The Bible is emphatic: Jesus bodily rose from the dead 3 days later. The tomb was empty. The disciples did not yet believe what Jesus or the Old Testament scriptures told them. They did not understand either. John was different...he believed then understood what he saw. Understanding follows faith. To find the power of resurrection life, you first must believe...genuinely believe. When you truly believe, then you will understand!  <br /><br /><br />The Hope Baptist Church Services for the week,<br />Sunday Morning Service - 10:30 AM <br />Sunday Evening Service - 5 PM<br />Children Class on Sunday - 10:30AM<br />Mens Bible Study on Tuesday - 7 PM<br />Women's Bible Study on Wednesday - 7 PM<br />Soul Winning on Saturday - 9:45 AM<br /><br />It is easy to give to Hope Baptist Church! <br /><br />The website has a very simple, secure and reliable portal for giving. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hope.ie/online-giving/">https://hope.ie/online-giving/</a><br /><br />If you would like to give directly to the church bank account, contact us for details.<br /><br />For more details please do visit our website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hope.ie">https://hope.ie</a><br />Thank you.{% endraw %}
