{% raw %}🇵🇰 The craziest thing about Pakistan is the hospitality. People here are crazy hospitable. They offer you chai wherever you go and always want to talk to you. But the craziest thing is that when you go to buy stuff, 80% of the time they won't take money from you. It doesn't matter if you're buying food, clothes, water... shop keepers won't take money from their &quot;guests&quot;. It's like nothing I've ever experienced. Enjoy this crazy video displaying the culture.<br />Il------------------------------------------<br />Updates from the road:<br />► Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/chrismixlewis/">https://www.instagram.com/chrismixlewis/</a><br />► Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/chrismix">https://www.patreon.com/chrismix</a><br />------------------------------------------<br />#Pakistan #Urdu{% endraw %}
