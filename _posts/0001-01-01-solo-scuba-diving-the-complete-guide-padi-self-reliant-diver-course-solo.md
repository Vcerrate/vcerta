{% raw %}Solo Scuba Diving: The Complete Guide! (PADI Self Reliant Diver Course). One of our most viewed playlists on the Everything Scuba channel and one of the things we get asked most about is the area of Solo Scuba Diving (PADI Self Reliant Diver). So we thought we would take all of our videos from this series and edit them down to bring you the most essential information you would want to know if you are considering becoming a Solo (Self Reliant) Diver. This hour long video walks you through the considerations of; the dangers and misconceptions of diving alone vs solo diving, who should think about pursuing this course, what are the essential and must have pieces of gear, what theoretical knowledge should you hold, what skills will you be asked to perform, and lastly Lyell will show the ultimate &quot;Zen&quot; of being underwater as a fully prepared, self reliant, solo diver!<br /><br />Want to support the Everything Scuba Channel: (Check out our new Merch store!)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://everything-scuba-merch-store.creator-spring.com/">https://everything-scuba-merch-store.creator-spring.com/</a><br />(NOTE: $1 of each purchase is donate to Project Aware!)<br /><br />Subscribe to Everything Scuba  (If you're already subscribed, thanks!
