{% raw %}On March 23, 2021, a traffic stop was conducted on a speeding vehicle in Osseo, WI. While the officer made contact with the occupants, they claimed there was nothing illegal in the vehicle. When the K9 was deployed, she was alerted to the odor of narcotics. Police ended up discovering a rectangular shape object tucked inside a concealed area of the vehicle. <br /><br />For business inquiries or other questions contact:<br />codebluecam@gmail.com<br /><br />The purpose of the featured content is to show the law enforcement interaction.
