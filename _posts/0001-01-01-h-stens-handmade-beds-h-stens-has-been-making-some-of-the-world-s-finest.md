{% raw %}Hästens has been making some of the world's finest beds by hand in Sweden for 165 years. We initially visited their headquarters and factory in Köping in 2000. With the launch of their first ever publicly available bed collaborations it was time for us to go back and get the story behind the two new editions, the Appaloosa and Marwari, which premier today at Il Salone del Mobile in Milan.{% endraw %}
