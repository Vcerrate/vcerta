{% raw %}In May I was lucky enough to be invited to Tampa, Florida to compete in the first ever &quot;Creator Clash&quot;, an influencer boxing event designed to raise money for charity. Together with the other fighters we raised over 1.3 million dollars! It was a life-changing experience to not only compete but watch my fellow YouTubers fight as well, such as Michael Reeves, Harley from Epic Meal Time, Graham Stephan, Alex Ernst, Justamix, Hundar, AB from the H3 podcast, Dad and Mat Watson, James from TheOdd1sOut, and so many more. While this event was an incredible success and couldn't possibly be overshadowed by anything, it didn't come without its controversies. Today I want to give you a behind the scenes look at my time in Tampa and everything surrounding my main event fight with Creator Clash creator, iDubbbz. If you followed the event at all then you may already know about the mix up with rounds and their lengths, the anger towards my glove tap in the second round, or any of the other drama that's been discussed on reddit forums and podcasts across YouTube. Today I want to discuss all of it and let you know what really happened, and finally put the fake beef to rest.<br /><br />Also, who should I fight next?<br /><br />I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously.
