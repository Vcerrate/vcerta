{% raw %}We are going to do something different for the &quot;gift season&quot; this year &amp; made up some cuttings of pepinos to share with family &amp; friends.. We decided that the best gift is one that people can enjoy for many years &amp; encourage them to get into the garden.. They needed some time to grow so thought it best we get a head start &amp; hopefully a few will be flowering by the time they are given out..<br /><br /><br />For more regular updates about the patch come visit &amp; &quot;Like&quot; us at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Bitsouttheback">https://www.facebook.com/Bitsouttheback</a><br />Have a great one..{% endraw %}
