{% raw %}The term 'Web 2.0' is used to describe the second generation of internet services, from static information dumps to an interactive and social internet. Some believe we're now at the start of the next generation, 3.0, where web services will become decentralised and more privacy oriented. Brave is one of the companies at the forefront of this push into Web 3.0, and in this interview Des Martin, partnerships director at Brave, explored why he sees Web 3.0 as 'the Web of value', and how it will change the nature of digital advertising. Filmed at TV Rise 2019 in San Sebastian.{% endraw %}
