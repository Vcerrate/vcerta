Worakls is currently breaking new ground with his trademark sound - fusing live musical elements with cutting edge electronic music production skills. His latest adventure is named “Question Réponse”, a dramatic piece of modern dance music, featuring blaring horns, an incredible romantic string section as well as arpeggiated synth layers to provide enormous drive. The thick rolling bassline and thumping groove glue together this masterpiece in perfect style. <br /><br />On the flip side resides the equally breathtaking “From Now On” piece. Worakls focuses on a marching &amp; moody feel, before breaking the track down, to only feature the gorgeously crafted strings and horns. He once again brings together the classical and dance worlds in an inimitable way, so they can flourish on dancefloors worldwide as well as everywhere else!{% endraw %}
