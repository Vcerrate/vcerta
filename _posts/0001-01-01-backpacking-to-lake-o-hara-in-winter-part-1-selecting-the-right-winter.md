{% raw %}Winter backpacking allows you to enjoy the Rockies year round.  It also provides the opportunity to enjoy popular summer destinations without the crowds.<br /><br />This is my first overnight backcountry trip of 2022.  I'm joined by Whalley Walks for a two night stay at Lake O'Hara.  In part 1 I show how I transition from summer gear to winter gear.  Hiking in winter doesn't necessarily require a lot of new gear, and it's a great way to improve your overall skills.  If you can be comfortable in winter sub-freezing temperatures of -20C, you'll be absolutely comfortable during the warm summer months.<br /><br />0:00 Introduction<br />4:54 Selecting my winter gear<br />11:27 Choosing my sleeping bag<br />16:51 Liquid fuel<br />19:14 Loading everything into my pack<br /><br />My CalTopo map of the area: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://caltopo.com/m/Q1QE8">https://caltopo.com/m/Q1QE8</a><br /><br /><br />#LakeOHara #Yoho #Backpacking{% endraw %}
