{% raw %}Lyrics:<br /><br />I woke up with a migraine<br />And it's driving me insane<br />From the outside of my head<br />To the inside of my brain<br />You seem too satisfied<br />When you're watching me in pain<br />But jokes on you I made it up<br />I'm actually ok<br /><br />I know that you can be so insecure<br />You treat me like I am an animal<br />The way that I dress doesn't make me criminal<br />Why should you care?<br /><br />People talking as you do<br />About the life that they would choose<br />And they're not happy about me<br />They're not happy about me<br />People talking everywhere<br />And when they run I know they're scared<br />They're not happy about me<br /><br />She told him<br />And He told her<br />She then told everyone else in the room<br />And everybody knew about me<br />Please don't react<br />To all of the littlest things that I do<br />You're trying to wear me out<br />To make you feel brand new<br /><br />I know that you can be so insecure<br />You treat me like I am an animal<br />The way that I dress doesn't make me criminal<br />Why should you care?<br /><br />People talking as you do<br />About the life that they would choose<br />And they're not happy about me<br />They're not happy about me<br />People talking everywhere<br />And when they run I know they're scared<br />They're not happy about me<br /><br />'Cause I am the enemy I can do anything<br />I could be better so don't get ahead of me<br />I've got the melody, I've got the remedy<br />You got the rumours you're meant to be telling me<br />Heavily, deadly thinking of me<br />And I'm looking at you and you don't have a clue<br />Because nobody knows anything that you do<br />And you wanna be me<br />I don't wanna be you<br />And then you wanna see<br />What it's like in these shoes<br />And then every time you could be taking a step<br />You'd be taking a few as your shoes will be loose<br />And then you could be here<br />Keeping up with the pace<br />And you trip on the lace<br />And you land on your face<br />And it happens again and again and again<br />And you look so out of place<br /><br />I know that you can be so insecure<br />You treat me like I am an animal<br />The way that I dress doesn't make me criminal<br />Why should you care?<br /><br />People talking as you do<br />About the life that they would choose<br />And they're not happy about me<br />They're not happy about me<br />People talking everywhere<br />And when they run I know they're scared<br />They're not happy about me<br />They're not happy about me<br /><br />They're not happy about me<br />They're not happy about me<br />They're not happy about me<br />They're not happy about me<br /><br />They're not happy about me<br />They're not happy about me<br />They're not happy about me<br />They're not happy about me<br /><br />They're not happy about me<br />They're not happy about me<br />They're not happy about me<br />They're not happy about<br /><br />People talking as you do<br />About the life that they would choose<br />And they're not happy about me<br />They're not happy about<br />People talking everywhere<br />And when they run I know they're scared<br />They're not happy about me<br />They're not happy about...{% endraw %}
