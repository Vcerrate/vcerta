{% raw %}Learn more about ST’s MEMS Pressure Sensors: www.st.com/pressure<br /><br />ST’s barometers are using a unique fully molded package providing high robustness to degradation by external mechanical and thermal stress and allowing the use of the component in harsh environments. <br />ST’s waterproof pressure sensors are available in a ceramic LGA package with a metal lid and are guaranteed to operate over an extended temperature range from -40 °C to +85 °C or +105 °C. The holed package allows external pressure to reach the sensing element.<br />The gel inside the IC protects the electrical components from water and the metal cap is, optionally, connected to the ground or left floating electrically in the application PCB layout. <br /><br />For more information on our latest generation MEMS pressure sensor download the documentation: en.FLYER_LPS28DFW_021722.pdf (st.com){% endraw %}
