This coating can be applied to paint, glass, black trim, and every exterior surface you can think of. It is also extremely user friendly, and frankly a retail coating that I really enjoyed working with. <br /><br />While I don't think THIS INDIVIDUAL coating is the least expensive, most convenient, and longest lasting coating I have ever used, it is a good representation of those things that I am looking for when I purchase a retail grade ceramic, so let me explain why. <br /><br />Firstly, there is a lot of coating that comes in the bottle, and based on the application of this ceramic coating on the Kia I coated, I would say I could easily get through 4 vehicles this size with one bottle. If you do the math, that is about $33 per application, and assuming we are charging several hundred to several thousand dollars per application, that is some serious profit. <br /><br />Secondly, this coating is EXTREMELY easy to apply, and I don't just mean on the paint. One of the things I love about this ceramic coating is the fact that it can be applied to so many different surfaces. I was able to coat the paint, the glass, and restore all of the black trim around the windows and other parts of the car without having to worry about staining, or taping off! This Mckees graphene ceramic coating goes right on top of all of those surfaces for LONG TERM PROTECTION. <br /><br />Lastly, I did a bit of a &quot;ceramic coating durability test&quot; with a test hood I have in my garage by leaving this coating to dry on the paint for 12 hours, then seeing what we would have to do to remove this ceramic coating from the car paint. In my experience, a ceramic coating that creates the kind of shield on the test hood that this did has a high likelihood of lasting the amount of time claimed on the bottle, and in this case we are looking at 5 years. <br /><br />In those ways, this ceramic coating falls into that category of the least expensive, most convenient, and longest lasting ceramic coating in the auto detailing industry.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />Some of the links here are affiliate links meaning Wilson Auto Detailing will be compensated should the viewer choose to purchase anything through the links provided.
