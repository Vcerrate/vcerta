The Atheist Experience is produced by the Atheist Community of Austin.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Atheist Community of Austin is organized as a nonprofit educational corporation to develop and support the atheist community, to provide opportunities for socializing and friendship, to promote secular viewpoints, to encourage positive atheist culture, to defend the first amendment principle of state-church separation, to oppose discrimination against atheists and to work with other organizations in pursuit of common goals.<br /><br /><br /><br />We define atheism as the lack of belief in gods. This definition also encompasses what most people call agnosticism.<br /><br /><br /><br />VISIT THE ACA'S OFFICIAL WEB SITES<br /><br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.atheist-community.org">http://www.atheist-community.org</a> (The Atheist Community of Austin)<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.atheist-experience.com">http://www.atheist-experience.com</a> (The Atheist Experience TV Show)<br /><br /><br /><br />► More shows and video clips can be found in the archive:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.atheist-experience.com/archive">http://www.atheist-experience.com/archive</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► DVDs of the Atheist Experience can be purchased via:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.atheist-community.com/products">http://www.atheist-community.com/products</a><br /><br /><br /><br />NOTES<br /><br /><br /><br />TheAtheistExperience is the official channel of The Atheist Experience. &quot;The Atheist Experience&quot; is a trademark of the ACA. <br /><br /><br /><br />The views and opinions expressed by hosts, guests, or callers are their own and not necessarily representative of the Atheist Community of Austin.<br /><br /><br /><br />Opening Theme: <br /><br />Shelley Segal &quot;Saved&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.shelleysegal.com/">http://www.shelleysegal.com/</a><br /><br />Limited use license by Shelley Segal  <br /><br />Copyright © 2011 Shelley Segal<br /><br /><br /><br />Copyright © 1997 Atheist Community of Austin.
