{% raw %}Process Capability is an important topic in continuous improvement and quality engineering and in this video, we discuss the basics of process capability, the major indices (Cp, Cpk, Pp, Ppk) and how to interpret those results!<br /><br /><br />0:50 – An Introduction to Process Capability – Comparing our process against our specifications<br /><br /><br />2:22 – The Cp Index – measuring the “potential” of your process<br /><br /><br />4:50 – The Cpk Index – A worked example and Explanation of the equation<br /><br /><br />6:40 – The Cpk Index – Centering up our process and re-calculating Cpk.<br /><br /> <br />7:35 – The Pp index – Explaining the 2 different methods for calculating the standard deviation, and a discussion around process control<br /><br /><br />11:20 – The Ppk Index – Looking at the equation, and discussing the standard deviation (again)<br /><br />11:55 – Interpreting the Results of your Capability Value – the sigma level, % Conforming, DPM (Defects Per Million) and Defect Rate (1 in 10,000??)<br /><br />Standard Deviation Video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/igbNaVkjfQk">https://youtu.be/igbNaVkjfQk</a><br />Control Charts Video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Aj7lJLR-7b4">https://youtu.be/Aj7lJLR-7b4</a><br /><br /><br />Learn More at www.CQEAcademy.com<br /><br />Get a free course on the Top 10 Topics on the CQE Exam:<br />www.CQEAcademy.com/freecourse{% endraw %}
