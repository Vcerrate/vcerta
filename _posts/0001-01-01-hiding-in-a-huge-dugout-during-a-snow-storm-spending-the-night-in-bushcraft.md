{% raw %}The huge dugout becomes more and more beautiful over time, but not only the shelter itself changes, but everything around, we can assume that I came to her in late autumn, and woke up when a full-fledged winter came, the next day I took a walk to the river, for reconnaissance and concepts of the situation, how good the ice has become, in order to go bushcraft fishing next weekend, in general, the rest is a bomb, can we say that it almost turned out to be a hut, I think yes , and i stay in snow strom spending the night in  bushcraft shelter<br /><br />I'm waiting for everyone in the comments, and whoever likes the video gets into the hall of fame of my channel){% endraw %}
