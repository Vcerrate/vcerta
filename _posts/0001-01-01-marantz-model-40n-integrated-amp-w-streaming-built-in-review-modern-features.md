If you can afford the 30 Series units, you will get a much beefier power amplifier that is capable of controlling your speakers a whole lot better, but the DAC/streaming part of the 40n seems really competent to us and the amp is better than we expected. Of course, you don‚Äôt get a CD player like you do with the 30 Series model, but you do gain HDMI Arc in the 40n, which is a great feature for those of you who want to use your two-channel stereo with your TV.<br /><br />Plus, you get that classic appearance we love about the 30 series, and the touch and feel of the controls is just first class. When it comes down to it, the Marantz 40n offers a great feature set, beautifully built quality, and sound that is going to be very hard to beat for its cost.<br /><br />üì±Follow Us üì±<br />Instagram ‚û° <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/audio.advice/">https://www.instagram.com/audio.advice/</a><br />Facebook ‚û° <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/audioadvicenc/">https://www.facebook.com/audioadvicenc/</a><br />TikTok ‚û° <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@audio_advice">https://www.tiktok.com/@audio_advice</a><br /><br />#Marantz #Model40n #IntegratedAmp<br /><br />Chat with us online üíª <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://audioadvice.io/aa-chat">https://audioadvice.io/aa-chat</a> ‚òéÔ∏è Call for sales and support: 888.899.8776{% endraw %}
