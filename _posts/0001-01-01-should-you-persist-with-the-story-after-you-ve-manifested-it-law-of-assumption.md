{% raw %}So you've successfully manifested your desire. Should you keep persisting with the story that brought this manifestation into your reality? It's an awesome question and in this video I'm going to answer it and I'll also share a personal example.  <br /><br />** New videos Monday to Friday **<br /><br />I'm Hedley Derenzie and I'm a qualified life coach, adult educator and author. I'm also passionate about the teachings of the Law of Assumption, as originally taught by Neville Goddard which reveal how we can create the life of our dreams simply by engaging the power of our imagination.   <br /><br />Stories create life. The quality of our stories will determine the quality of our life. So, if you want to change anything, then you have to start by changing the story. <br /><br />We are all worthy and deserving of our ideal life and it all begins in our imagination with the stories we are choosing to focus on. I want to help people to tell better, more amazing stories and that's why I'm here!  <br /><br />If you would like to work with me directly, I offer one to one coaching and mini coaching.
