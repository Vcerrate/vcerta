{% raw %}The wonderful short documentary Once More. The Story of VIN 903847 -- the incredible history of a 1955 Volkswagen Beetle. Academy Award nominated director Hubert Davis looks to investigate the incredible history of a 1955 Volkswagen Beetle, VIN 903847, through each of its drivers. Dating back to the original owner, three remarkable solo trips around the world are just the start of the story. As much as it is a story about the people connected by one machine, it's also an observation of our enduring fascination with the automobile.<br /><br /><br />More great air-cooled adventures at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.vdubxs.com">https://www.vdubxs.com</a>{% endraw %}
