{% raw %}Inspired by the artist Karla Gerard, I created this sub-plan video for my 1st through 4th grade students. With my sub, my students will draw and color. When I return, we'll paint! This will make is so when I return, we are all on the same page...this gives me time to settle back in to the week. Feel free to use this lesson in your art teacherin' world!{% endraw %}
