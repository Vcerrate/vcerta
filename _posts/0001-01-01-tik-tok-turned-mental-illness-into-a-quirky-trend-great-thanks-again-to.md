We're checking out tik tok today because I had someone reach out and mention that looking into tik tok's mental health content might make for a good topic! They weren't kidding there's definitely a lot of interesting stuff going on there that I feel like connects to a larger issue the internet seems to have when it comes to talking about mental illnesses that I thought we could look into. Honestly feels like the same &quot;repeating of internet history&quot; we saw with the &quot;i'm not like other girls&quot; trend on there but now it's the oversimplifying and romanticization of mental illness... great. <br /><br />I'm sure if you've been online you've seen some &quot;signs you had ADHD/depression/anxiety&quot; videos or maybe saw the recent &quot;getting the chills means you have anxiety&quot; tweet that got a ton of traction last week. Either way it feels like you can't escape this kind of content these days and it definitely reminds me a LOT of tumblr back in the day where you had people over simplifying illnesses and disorders to the point where anyone could watch a video and convince themselves they had whatever illness the video was talking about. which is kind of scary considering that tik tok is a lot more popular and accessible to young kids and I feel like we're still seeing the effects that tumblr had on teenagers during the mid 2010's so like... what's gonna happen to these kids now. The ability that app has to speedrun spreading misinformation is also super scary to consider in this situation too.  And to make matters worse I feel like nowthe issue isn't even limited to mental illnesses anymore considering the (frankly strange) rise in people self diagnosing themselves with ibs of all things... lmao. <br /><br />I thought we could check out some of the content for ourselves from ADHD tik tok as well as the general umbrella of mental illness content to see  the ~implications~ of it all as well as why not only the content machine for it but also the more accepted &quot;quirky&quot; self deprecating versions of the same content are partly to blame. So if you're interested in watching some of the very weird mental health content tik tok has to offer and exploring it's ripple effects on the internet, feel free to keep watching! <br /><br />Like i mentioned in the video I'd love to hear what you guys think about this stuff, obviously i don't have experience with every mental illness in the world or the varying severities they can have so if you're open to sharing what you've seen about ones you have experience with and the problems with the way it's presented/talked about online (can be on tik tok or if it's another platform that's cool too) i'd love to hear your thoughts! Of course no pressure tho, hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if you did feel free to give it a like and subscribe if you wanna see more stuff from me! But otherwise thanks for watching and i'll see yall in the next one :))) <br /><br />Socials~*~*~*<br /><br />☞ IG: caseyaonso<br />☞ Twitter: caseyaonso<br />☞ Spotify: caseyaonso<br /><br /><br />//Editing <br /><br />by Isabelle.jpeg and myself!<br /><br />//Other videos you might like<br /><br />The Evolution of Alpha Males is Disturbing…<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SyGrZHXn7A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SyGrZHXn7A</a><br /><br />The Meme-ification of &quot;World War 3&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcgeieZEgcs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcgeieZEgcs</a><br /><br />tik tok made &quot;i'm not like other girls&quot; trendy again... great  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO4IPgv8PII">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO4IPgv8PII</a><br /><br />a definitive ranking of cringey celebrity couples<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAEH-NolOjc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAEH-NolOjc</a><br /><br />The Celebrity NFT Craze is Insufferable<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuT7rJOH5WI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuT7rJOH5WI</a><br /><br />Netflix's Hype House Reality Show is an Absolute Disaster<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NcipNuRUzc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NcipNuRUzc</a><br /><br />wattpad's after franchise is falling apart and it's MESSY <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXkC2HSA6tE&amp;ab_channel=CaseyAonso">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXkC2HSA6tE&amp;ab_channel=CaseyAonso</a><br /><br />the drivers license drama in retrospect<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkNxlnAyb8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkNxlnAyb8</a><br /><br />exploring the unhinged history of twinfluencers<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEzHcH5VavE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEzHcH5VavE</a><br /><br />the sick and twisted reality of mommy blogging<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIF1Xv7L0CI&amp;ab_channel=CaseyAonso">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIF1Xv7L0CI&amp;ab_channel=CaseyAonso</a><br /><br />the true crime community is officially unhinged <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Yo3w_4qX8&amp;ab_channel=CaseyAonso">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Yo3w_4qX8&amp;ab_channel=CaseyAonso</a><br /><br />the tik tok POV community is a disaster <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXBTmsXCYZc&amp;ab_channel=CaseyAonso">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXBTmsXCYZc&amp;ab_channel=CaseyAonso</a><br /><br />netflix turned our worst wattpad nightmare into a movie... <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z-Cf2K2zJE&amp;t=351s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z-Cf2K2zJE&amp;t=351s</a><br /><br />hustle culture is an absolute nightmare <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuZ-AoJb6rU&amp;ab_channel=CaseyAonso">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuZ-AoJb6rU&amp;ab_channel=CaseyAonso</a><br /><br />a definitive ranking of influencer scams <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yw8OaRgXcE&amp;ab_channel=CaseyAonso">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yw8OaRgXcE&amp;ab_channel=CaseyAonso</a><br /><br />what happens to youtubers after they &quot;expire?&quot; <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogt5uTsDbpE&amp;t=0s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogt5uTsDbpE&amp;t=0s</a><br /><br />exploring the world of youtuber scams <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAnIbBhOmoI&amp;t=570s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAnIbBhOmoI&amp;t=570s</a>{% endraw %}
