{% raw %}The Goldilocks Question: How Much Land is Just Right?<br /><br />Great question from D.K. today - How much land is enough (or too much)?<br /><br />Believe us, we did a lot of soul-searching before we decided on this 160-acre lot, after living for almost 10 years in the suburbs of Calgary! And like most people who are looking to build a permaculture property, we often asked ourselves &quot;What size is the right size?&quot;<br /><br />But right from the beginning, size took second place to other factors we'd laid out in our values and vision statement. Things like woods, streams, space for gardens and livestock, community, and most important - no restriction from zoning or community covenants or bylaws.<br /><br />Those were just a few of our criteria. Learn more about why having clear values and vision for your property (and your life plans!) is the most important factor in guiding your choices in this video - part of our Adaptive Habitat family journey!
