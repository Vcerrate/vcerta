{% raw %}&quot;한국로타리 전국대회&quot; 부산서 성황리에 개최<br /><br />Rotary Korea, one of the Rotary Clubs which is a global network that volunteers to bring lasting changes to the world, is holding its annual conference in the southeastern city of Busan this year.<br />Our Hong Yoo has the details.  <br />The Rotary Korea Conference kicked off on Tuesday in Busan and it will continue until Thursday.<br />During these three days, Rotarians will go over their achievements of this year and devise a direction and strategy for 2019. <br /> <br /> About one thousand Rotarians, including the president of Rotary International, Barry Rassin and General Secretary John Hewko, gathered to share the newest policies and programs of Rotary International and to come up with solutions to some difficulties that Rotary Korea is facing.<br /><br />One of the biggest things Rotary International has achieved is reducing the number of children suffering from polio. It was back in 1985 that Rotary International took on the challenge of eradicating polio worldwide. At the time, there were 350,000 cases of polio a year in 125 countries. Today the numbers are down to only 25 cases in two countries, Afghanistan and Pakistan.<br /><br />&quot;While we do all the six areas of focus, we will not replace our number one priority until we have certified eradication of polio.&quot;<br /><br />Rotary Korea was established in 1927 now has more than 60-thousand members in 19 different regional clubs providing humanitarian services to their local communities.<br /><br />&quot;Korea is one of the strongest Rotary countries. We have about 66 thousand members, 1,646 Rotary Clubs. We see strong membership growth in Korea and Korean Rotarians are very active in all kinds of peace projects, scholarship programs, water and sanitation program, and disease prevention and treatment. Many Rotary Clubs in Korea work with Rotary clubs in other parts of the world to deal with humanitarian issues that are in those countries. So we are very proud of Rotary Clubs in Korea.&quot;<br /><br />Rotary Korea will be turning 100 years old in 2027. And as they meet this week, the Rotarians will be laying out the goals they hope to achieve by the time that anniversary comes.<br />Hong Yoo, Arirang News, Busan. <br /><br />Arirang News Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/arirangtvnews">http://www.facebook.com/arirangtvnews</a><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />[Subscribe Arirang Official YouTube]<br />ARIRANG TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/arirang">http://www.youtube.com/arirang</a><br />ARIRANG RADIO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/Music180Arirang">http://www.youtube.com/Music180Arirang</a><br />ARIRANG NEWS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/arirangnews">http://www.youtube.com/arirangnews</a><br />ARIRANG K-POP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/arirangworld">http://www.youtube.com/arirangworld</a><br />ARIRANG ISSUE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/arirangtoday">http://www.youtube.com/arirangtoday</a><br />ARIRANG CULTURE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/arirangkorean">http://www.youtube.com/arirangkorean</a><br />ARIRANG FOOD &amp; TRAVEL : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/ArirangFoodTravel">http://www.youtube.com/ArirangFoodTravel</a><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />[Visit Arirang TV Official Pages]<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/arirangtv">http://www.facebook.com/arirangtv</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/arirangworld">http://twitter.com/arirangworld</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/arirangworld">http://instagram.com/arirangworld</a><br />Homepage: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.arirang.com">http://www.arirang.com</a><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />[Arirang K-Pop]<br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/arirangworld">http://www.youtube.com/arirangworld</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/arirangkpop">http://www.facebook.com/arirangkpop</a><br />Google+: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plus.google.com/+arirangworld">http://plus.google.com/+arirangworld</a>{% endraw %}
