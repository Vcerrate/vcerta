{% raw %}Its been too long. This, my friends, is what I've been working on. Between this and my endless lack of an attention span that can keep me focused for longer than two minutes, I humbly bring you the &quot;Beginners' Guide to Dark Souls.&quot; <br /><br />I understand that i didn't cover much beyond stats, but i figured with the amount of information presented, it would be better to cover the rest in the next part, which I am working on now.<br /><br />For those interested, here is that vitality breakdown, straight from the wiki: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://darksouls.wikidot.com/vitality">http://darksouls.wikidot.com/vitality</a><br /><br />If you enjoyed the video, please subscribe! I got plenty more in the works from both this channel, and stuff in cooperation with Drathamus from Drathamusgaming.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Stay Awesome!{% endraw %}
