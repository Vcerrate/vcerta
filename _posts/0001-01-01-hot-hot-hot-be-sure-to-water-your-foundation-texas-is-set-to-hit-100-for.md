{% raw %}Texas is set to hit 100+ for the next 9-10 days. This means you need to be using soaker hoses around the parameter of your home daily. Williamson recommends 30-40 minute intervals each day. Keep up this aggressive watering until temperatures drop below 100 degrees. If you have questions comment below.{% endraw %}
