{% raw %}60's inspired love song.<br />Lyrics:<br />[Verse 1]<br />Time after time<br />We have done this before<br />Tracing the line<br />From your eyes to the door<br />I cannot live with this love anymore<br />After a while, if it makes you smile, I'll be yours<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Speak to me gently<br />Your jar of hearts is getting heavy<br />And I'm a long way from accepting<br />Why we can't have a happy ending<br />I guess I never thought there would be<br />A day you wouldn't want to kiss me<br />And how it happened is a mystery<br />So I'll just have to keep on acting as if it's alright now<br />It's alright...<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />Line after line<br />We've rehearsed this before<br />Reading your lips<br />With a lump in my throat<br />I cannot lift up my eyes from the floor<br />After a while, I won't make you smile anymore<br /><br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Speak to me gently<br />Your jar of hearts is getting heavy<br />And I'm a long way from accepting<br />Why we can't have a happy ending<br />I guess I never thought there would be<br />A day you wouldn't want to kiss me<br />And how it happened is a mystery<br />So I'll just have to keep on acting as if it's alright now<br />It's alright now<br />As if it's alright now<br />It's alright...{% endraw %}
