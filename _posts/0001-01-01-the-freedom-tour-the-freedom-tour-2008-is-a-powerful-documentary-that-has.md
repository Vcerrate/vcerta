{% raw %}The Freedom Tour (2008) is a powerful documentary that has been raising awareness about institutions both nationally and internationally. <br /><br />The film documents the incredible journey of 16 self-advocates and friends who travelled across the Prairie Provinces to raise awareness about life in an institution. The documentary portrays compelling stories told by survivors of institutions who had moved into communities across the Prairies. Produced in partnership with the National Film Board, The Freedom Tour is unique in that People First members were involved in all aspects of the film-making process - from development to the big screen.{% endraw %}
