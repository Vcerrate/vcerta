{% raw %}If you want to strengthen your core, then my Yoga For Abs video is for you! <br /><br />Did you know that firming your abs helps to support your spine, so you get less back pain? Sitting at your desk all day is killer for your back, but this 10-minute video will stretch you out and strengthen your abs at the same time. Win, win.<br /><br />This video is good for beginners and will give you a nice challenge if you’ve had lots of yoga practice too. I’m building up my core strength now Shay is bigger, and the more I do this routine, the more I feel the difference in my abs.
