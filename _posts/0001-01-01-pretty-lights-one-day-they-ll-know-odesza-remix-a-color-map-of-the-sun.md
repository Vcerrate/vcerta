{% raw %}Available for free download December 10th at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://prettylightsmusic.com/music">http://prettylightsmusic.com/music</a><br /><br />The Remixes collection is a full-length re-imagination of A Color Map of the Sun. Derek Vincent Smith -- aka Pretty Lights -- invited producers from a wide stylistic spectrum to remix the tracks from his latest album. Derek produced A Color Map of the Sun with no intention of having it be an album of dance floor bangers, but rather a collection of music that can be enjoyed anyplace, anytime, all the time.<br /><br />These Remixes are other artists' interpretations of his compositions and self made vinyl samples. The tracks are mostly intended to be hard hitting, but they are also just very different.{% endraw %}
