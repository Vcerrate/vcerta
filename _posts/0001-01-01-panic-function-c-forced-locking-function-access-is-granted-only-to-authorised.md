{% raw %}Access is granted only to authorised persons. In contrast to the panic function E, a lever handle is mounted on the outside.<br />In order to activate this exterior lever handle, an authorised key is required. Thus, with inserted key, it is possible to open the door from the outside via the lever handle.<br />That means, the latch is retracted not by means of the key, but via the lever handle. This function is ideally suited for large and heavy doors. The lever handle allows easier opening with low effort.{% endraw %}
