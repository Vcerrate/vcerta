{% raw %}Heyy, okay so a little backstory I am not the original creator of this video or any of the songs in this playlist. The original creator is called adamaris and this video is no longer on their channel. <br />So for the people who liked the video such as myself I am re uploading it. Also I would like to point out I saw someone else re-upload it yet they only uploaded the first 15 or minutes or so and I want people to have access to the full so thing here it is. Also if you've noticed the song tv girl and one other are no longer in this playlist. I replaced tv girl with heather because it got copyrighted and I think that might be what happened to the original, so apologies for that. Anyways thats about it so I hoped you enjoyed and thanks for watching :)<br /><br />Original creator: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUU_GibfMAbQP-47qr5tYcA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUU_GibfMAbQP-47qr5tYcA</a><br /><br />My Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pin.it/1cXdxMO">https://pin.it/1cXdxMO</a><br /><br />The video that I got heather from: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp4pkAvnEw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp4pkAvnEw</a><br /><br />Time stamps:<br />00:00 Inside Out - Duster<br />2:20 The Beach - mxpheebz<br />6:03 Young - VACATIONS <br />9:11 dream girl - crisaunt<br />12:10 Heather - Conan Gray<br />15:10 Each Time You Fall In Love - Cigarettes After<br />Sex<br />19:59 Dream, Ivory - Dream, Ivory<br />23:08 Pluto Projector - Rex Orange County<br />24:53 Clair De Lune - Claude Debussy<br /><br />Thank you to Kaj Marfil for the time stamps ðŸ’—<br />(I pinned their comment){% endraw %}
