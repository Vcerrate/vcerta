{% raw %}SUBSCRIBE to Truly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj">http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj</a><br /><br />A 2FT 10in exotic dancer has told of how she's judged for her relationship with her 5ft 7in boyfriend over both their height difference and 13 year age gap. Cassee, 32, who holds the title of the world's smallest stripper, met Blake, 19, via Facebook dating last summer. Realising there was a spark, they soon fell for one another, moving in together after just one month. Unfortunately, since going public with their relationship, they have had to deal with a lot of judgment - both on and offline. Photos of the two of them have been splashed across social media, accompanied by unkind, mocking comments. The whirlwind nature of their relationship also had some loved ones worried. However, the pair continue to go from strength to strength and are happier than ever. Cassee concluded: &quot;I want people to know that you're not disgusting or wrong for being in a relationship with a little person. But also, my height doesn't represent all of me. Why can't Blake just want to be with me because he cares about me or finds me beautiful?&quot;<br /><br />Follow Cassee here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sasseecassee89/">https://www.instagram.com/sasseecassee89/</a><br /><br />Thank you to Soul+Flame for their photography for this project.
