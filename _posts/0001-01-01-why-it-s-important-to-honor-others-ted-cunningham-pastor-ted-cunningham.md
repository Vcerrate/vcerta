{% raw %}Pastor Ted Cunningham shares the importance of seeing all human beings as image-bearers of God.  He’ll challenge you to encourage your friends and family by “calling out” their positive attributes, and shares humorous examples from his own family. He recommends writing “honor” lists and giving them to family and friends, especially as a birthday gift.<br /><br />Get the CD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3tfWd6P">https://bit.ly/3tfWd6P</a><br /><br />For more resources on this topic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/34tZWDy">https://bit.ly/34tZWDy</a><br /><br />--- <br /><br />Check out Focus on the Family on social media! <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/focusonthefamily">https://www.facebook.com/focusonthefamily</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FocusFamily">https://twitter.com/FocusFamily</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/focusonthefamily">https://www.instagram.com/focusonthefamily</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/focusonthefamily">https://www.pinterest.com/focusonthefamily</a><br /><br />--- <br /><br />#FocusBroadcast #TedCunningham #WhyItsImportanttoHonorOthers #PuttingOthersFirst #FOTFBroadcast #FocusontheFamily{% endraw %}
