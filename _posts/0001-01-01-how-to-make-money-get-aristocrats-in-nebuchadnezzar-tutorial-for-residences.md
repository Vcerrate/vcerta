During the campaign, players will get to rule over influential historical cities filled with magnificent monuments they will design and construct. <br /><br />üõíGame's Steam store page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1157220/Nebuchadnezzar/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1157220/Nebuchadnezzar/</a><br />üÖæ GOG store page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gog.com/game/nebuchadnezzar">https://www.gog.com/game/nebuchadnezzar</a><br /><br />Gameplay wise players will get to manage everything from plowing fields to creating products, as they must oversee agriculture and the manufacturing of goods for the city's population. <br /><br />Nebuchadnezzar features an in-game ‚Äúmonument editor‚Äù giving players complete control over their monument‚Äôs design.

Solve problems, prevent population loss, trade with other cities, handle foreign relationships, take care of varying population classes and employee types across various industries and services, and many more. Nebuchadnezzar‚Äôs gameplay is geared towards all types of players: from beginners of the genre to experienced strategists.<br /><br />-Campaign<br />Nebuchadnezzar‚Äôs main campaign contains more than a dozen historical missions covering the colonization of ancient lands to the conquest of Babylon by Persians in the 6th Century bc. Each mission summons a different time period in Ancient Mesopotamian history, providing comprehensive historical experience. Players must carry out tasks important to the specific time and place of each mission, including the construction of historical monuments.<br /><br />-Monuments<br />During the campaign players will not only build complex ancient monuments, but design them too. Nebuchadnezzar features an in-game monument editor giving players complete control over their buildings. From structural design to color scheme to final details: it‚Äôs in the hands of the player. Will you recreate history or make history? It‚Äôs up to you.<br /><br />-Mods &amp; Localization<br />Nebuchadnezzar was created with mods and localization in mind. Expand your experience with the full support of mods from new buildings, new goods, production chains, and even new maps, missions, and campaigns. It is almost entirely moddable. Localizing mods will also not be a problem. You can create mods in multiple languages and/or add languages to existing ones. This applies to the base game as well.<br /><br />#Nebuchadnezzar#CityBuilder#makemoney{% endraw %}
