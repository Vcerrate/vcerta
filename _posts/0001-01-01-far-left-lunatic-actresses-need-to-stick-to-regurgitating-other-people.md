{% raw %}Sky News host Rita Panahi says Susan Sarandon has demonstrated wisdom does not always come with age by uploading an image of NYPD officers mourning detective Jason Rivera and mocking the gathering – comparing the cops to fascists.<br /><br />“So, if all these cops weren't needed for CRIME that day, doesn't that mean they aren't needed ANY day?” Ms Sarandon said. <br /><br />The American actress has since apologised for her post.<br /><br />“I deeply regret the meme I recently shared on Twitter that included a photo of officer Jason Rivera's funeral,” she said.  <br /><br />“I reacted quickly to the picture without connecting it to a police funeral and I realise now how insensitive and deeply disrespectful it was to make that point at that time.”<br /><br />Ms Panahi lambasted Ms Sarandon for being aware of “precisely where and when that picture was taken”.<br /><br />“It was front page news in your town, and, in any case, when is it ever acceptable to casually label American police officers fascists?” she said.   <br /><br />“I think it really would be best if these far-left lunatic actresses, and that includes you Whoopi, just stuck to regurgitating other people's lines.”{% endraw %}
