{% raw %}The date was November 27, 2021.  We had a very short window of opportunity to fish before the rain moved in.  The winds were coming in from the east at about 5 mph.  With the recent swings in weather, I decided to bank fish and leave the kayak for another day. <br /><br />#speckletrout  #flounder  #galveston{% endraw %}
