{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.blairsinger.com">http://www.blairsinger.com</a> Blair Singer explains that you can battle your Little Voice and boost your self confidence by bragging. Practice this technique by yourself. Make sure no one is within ear shot. Take a few second, get up, be loud, be outrageous, exaggerate or even lie, and beat your hands against your chest if you need to. When you scream at the top of your lungs that you are the best ________ (fill in the blank) in the world and wave your hands around like a maniac, it immediately changes your state of mind and body. All those doubts in your brain are going to be pushed aside. It doesn't matter if what you say is true, the point is to beat back the Little Voice that tells you you aren't good enough. Sometimes you have to fake it until you make it.<br /><br />Connect with Blair at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.blairsinger.com">http://www.blairsinger.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bzkpress.com">http://www.bzkpress.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/blairsinger1">http://www.facebook.com/blairsinger1</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/blairsinger">http://www.twitter.com/blairsinger</a>{% endraw %}
