{% raw %}&quot;TMBG wishes to make the case that not all of our songs have a single strict interpretation, but &quot;Spiraling Shape&quot; is generally about the fervent embrace and then abandonment of a cultural &quot;bubble.&quot; It might be &quot;smart&quot; drugs, it might be virtual whatever, or it could simply be spin art. Steve Light adds his snazzy vibraphone to this swirling cut.&quot;{% endraw %}
