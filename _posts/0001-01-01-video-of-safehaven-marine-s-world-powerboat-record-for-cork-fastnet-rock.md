{% raw %}Here's a pretty cool video of our record run in the over 50ft class for the Cork to the Fastnet Rock and back UIM World powerboat record, in our 23m long XSV20 ‘Thunder Child II’. We did it in a time of 2hrs 36 minutes averaging 44.6kts, which is pretty good I think for a 23m boat, recording a maximum speed of 53kts on the run. (subject to ratification by the UIM)<br />After a recce trip to the rock the day before, and with near perfect conditions forecast we made the decision to have a crack at setting the record the next day. Crossing the start line off Weavers Point at the entrance to Cork Harbour at 2pm on Sunday the 9th of August in light winds and only a long Atlantic ground swell to contend with, we set off on the first leg heading West. Arriving at the Fastnet Rock 1hrs 21 minutes later we were surprised and delighted to see a huge flotilla of 40-50 boats waiting close by the rock to watch as we passed and wave us on. Although it was a bit stressful navigating through them as we rounded the rock it was simply fabulous to see them all set chase after Thunder Child II as she headed home. Passing the Stags Rock and Kinsale Lighthouse heading East with boats coming out to watch us as she literally thundered home, (there’s some sound track from her quad 650hp engines and apparently she could be heard 10 miles away) and putting up a huge roster tail from her surface drives we crossed the finish line to another great welcome. A special thanks to everyone who came out in boats to support us, to Safetrax for the live tracking and the UIM officials for accommodating us at short notice.<br />Thunder Child II ran faultlessly during the run looking after her crew of: Skipper Frank Kowalski, Ciaran Monks, Carl Randalls, Mary Power &amp; Robert Guzik. We were kind to her engines keeping them at just 85-90% of full power throughout, only giving her the beans for the final 10miles towards the finish line running at over 50kts.{% endraw %}
