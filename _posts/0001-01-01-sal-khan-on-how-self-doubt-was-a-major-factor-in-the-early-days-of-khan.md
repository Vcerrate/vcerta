{% raw %}Sal Khan discussed how self doubt was a major factor in the early days of Khan Academy. “Looking back, as soon as I started thinking that this is what I want to do with my life, that this could be the virtual version of the great museums or the great universities and it could serve billions of people for generations to come, I was struck with ‘who do you think you are Sal? You’re just some guy. You have an opinion about education, but you’re not a formal educator. [You’re] a guy operating out of a walk-in closet; there’s no archetype for what you think you could do. You have no business model, zero experience in a not-for-profit realm.’”<br /><br />According to Khan, when in business school, though his school did not offer grades, the one course he would have failed was “social entrepreneurship.” And he noted that when he was starting out, he was initially rejected by 20 to 30 foundations. Yet, he persevered. And he said that is the most important thing for the entrepreneur: to get to the other side. “In any life journey, you’re going to hit those lows and remembering that previous low point can be a powerful muscle to know that you’re going to be able to resolve this newest challenge,” he said.  <br /><br />Explore the vibrancy and dynamism of the world-class educational environment at the Miami Herbert Business School, please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://herbert.miami.edu">https://herbert.miami.edu</a><br /> #YourTomorrowLivesHere{% endraw %}
