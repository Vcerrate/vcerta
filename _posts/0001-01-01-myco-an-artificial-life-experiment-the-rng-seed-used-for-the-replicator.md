{% raw %}The RNG seed used for the replicator demo in this video was 3005788183336928873.<br /><br />I make an error at 10:49 - I thought the aberration had happened due to a cosmic ray writing '@@' in a position that caused other organisms to assume there was a copy there. In fact, it was likely the result of an organism executing 'r-' due to a cosmic ray or write error, causing it to copy and paste a square of reduced size.<br />Repository: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/Reconcyl/myco">https://github.com/Reconcyl/myco</a>{% endraw %}
