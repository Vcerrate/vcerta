{% raw %}Ever since coming home from traveling for 6 months (check out all that #vanlife content for yourself ;)) I've been shifting and coming into a new stage of my life. <br /><br />Stability, financial freedom, creating a home base and setting long term goals for myself. All things that a year ago, I never would've thought would be what I'm focusing on in my life. I'm so excited to build this life for myself, have a creative space from where I can flourish, grow, create, be myself and thriiiveeeee. <br />Excited for some little trips with the van once it gets warmer though ;)<br /><br />Hope you enjoy the highlights of my week, falling in love with a more simple life.<br /><br />my links:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/magdalena.m">https://linktr.ee/magdalena.m</a>{% endraw %}
