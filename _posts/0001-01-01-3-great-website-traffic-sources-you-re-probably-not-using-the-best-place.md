{% raw %}The best place to get traffic from is new sources. Today I'm going to break down three great website traffic sources that you're probably not using.<br /><br />RESOURCES &amp; LINKS: <br />____________________________________________<br />Quora: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.quora.com/about">https://www.quora.com/about</a><br />Outbrain: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lp.outbrain.com/">https://lp.outbrain.com/</a><br />Zemanta: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.zemanta.com/">https://www.zemanta.com/</a><br />ARC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arc.dev/">https://arc.dev/</a><br />Taboola: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://advertise.taboola.com/">https://advertise.taboola.com/</a><br />ZergNet: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.zergnet.com/">https://www.zergnet.com/</a><br />AllTop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://alltop.com/">https://alltop.com/</a><br />9Rules: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://9rules.com/">http://9rules.com/</a><br />Ubersuggest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/">https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/</a><br />____________________________________________<br /><br />Source one, capitalize on websites with high domain authority and user-generated content. Look, the idea is to look at websites that have massive back link profiles and high domain authority. Beyond their back links and their domain authority, you want to use these websites that accept user generated content because you can go and upload content that they accept, link back to your website, and generate traffic. Great example of this is Quora and Wikipedia. <br /><br />There's tons of sites like this, but those are two examples. They rank for everything, they get tons of traffic. Even if the links don't help you with your SEO, it's okay. Go and participate in those communities, and where it makes sense, link back to your website. Where it doesn't make sense, don't do it. <br /><br />Do what's best for their community and this will drive you instant traffic. I remember at one point I had someone full-time just focus on responding on Quora and linking to my site. It's that effective. And after a while, I didn't have to do it because I've already been on Quora so many times now that I continue to get that residual traffic. <br /><br />Source number two, content syndication platforms. with this type of platform, you can get used to fine-tuned algorithms that will match your content with the content where your sponsored posts will appear. So let's say readers on a blog post about dog food and the content that you want to generate traffic for is around vegan dog food options. <br /><br />Those platforms will allow you to put your content in front of people who are already reading content on related topics. And they have tons of customization options that allow you to fine tune your targeting. It's almost like Facebook Ads or Google Ads and you get tons of audience options and geo targets. Here are some of the great examples of this type of platform. Outbrain, Zemanta, ARC, Taboola, ZergNet, AllTop, 9Rules. These are all great sources that you should check out. <br /><br />Source number three, you consume it, but you don't leverage it, YouTube. In 2021 alone, I have received over 150,000 visitors to my website from YouTube, but here's the kicker. That's roughly 12,000 visitors a month. That doesn't account for all the people that go to my website when I tell them, &quot;Hey, if you want my agency to do your marketing for you, check out NP Digital.&quot; If you've heard me say that before, leave a comment with, &quot;Hey Neil, I've heard you do that before.&quot; You'll see in the comment section how many people are saying it. That's the power of it. And that's not counted in those traffic stats. <br /><br />And here's what's even better than that. YouTube isn't cold traffic. I'm creating videos on marketing. People watch these videos. They're getting to know me, building that rapport. So then when I tell them to check out my website or check out my ad agency, NP Digital, the conversion rate is so much higher, because they're already warmed up and they've got to know me. <br /><br />Did you know that the number one traffic source for me when it comes to conversions is, take a guess. What do you think it is? It's Google. <br /><br />Number two, YouTube. I know number two, YouTube, is owned by Google, but we separate them out because it's separate sites. Now, the way you do this and bring traffic from YouTube is really simple. You create video-based content that's on evergreen topics. You can do keyword research by Ubersuggest. So you go to ubersuggest.com, you type in keywords related to your space, it tells you what's popular, you create videos around them. <br /><br />Another strategy that I do that has worked extremely well for me on YouTube is the reason my videos get tons of views and I be able to drive all that traffic to my website is the YouTube algorithm is almost the opposite of Google. Google, if you want to rank really well, slow and steady wins the race. YouTube, not so much so. If a video does really well in the first 24 hours, it can rank instantly at the top for any keyword.<br /><br /><br />► If you need help growing your business check out my ad agency Neil Patel Digital @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://neilpateldigital.com/">https://neilpateldigital.com/</a> <br /><br />►Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/ScRTwc">https://goo.gl/ScRTwc</a> to learn more secret SEO tips.<br />►Find me on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/neilkpatel/">https://www.facebook.com/neilkpatel/</a><br />►On Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/neilpatel/">https://instagram.com/neilpatel/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/GyjZJs9bG98">https://youtu.be/GyjZJs9bG98</a><br /><br />#SEO #NeilPatel #DigitalMarketing{% endraw %}
