{% raw %}Dear Grissinis,<br /><br />Never have I ever be more anxious posting a video. <br />This video is a marking checkpoint over the 12 years of adventures I had with the Grissini. I assume it deserves an unbearably long text about it. <br /><br />I started this channel alone in a gloomy practice room. <br />I've been always attracted to chamber music and I've been lucky to meet wonderful humans and musicians along my path as a musician. <br />For now 9 years I've been filming about 80% of Grissini Project videos with the same musicians. <br />For years I've been trying to squeeze in the project into everyone calendar, career path and personality. I managed but it came with the price of my health.<br />While it's not true with our concert activities, I'm fully aware that videos are very visual and part of our community got attached to specific people. I had the same concern in 2016 when we switched from 2 violin to 1 violin &amp; 1 cello. I also expect having various reactions to this video. <br />I decided to embrace the plural identity of the Grissini. Some organ, some piano, some chamber music, some chamber orchestra, and ultimately a plentiful amount of talented musicians I'm glad to work with, in Sweden or in France. <br />It is now necessary for me to reach a much more standard organisation and healthy format as a music ensemble. My recent and incredibly scary health issues sealed a decision that was already on its way. <br />As a proud dad and (Grissini shaped) human backbone for this project, I'm now happy to have different constellations of musicians joining in and out depending on occasions and projects.   <br />To fully commit this way is a new breath for the Grissini and I'm very excited about it! I hope it'll allow us to diversify our activities, make more content, more concert, more music, more crazy videos , more art, keep growing! Tatakae!   <br />It doesn't mean it is a goodbye to our regulars, it means we're diversifying, welcoming new people that'll join my explorations :) Still plenty of videos scheduled this year with Lilou, Bastien and Marwane. <br />In the meantime, I'll remain a guardian of the Grissini Project spirit like I always did. I'll still supervise and secure the artistic growth of the project and the music we do, still with the same exigency and eager to do better and to do what has never been seen. <br />I'm fearing people will bring inaccurate comments such as ''it was better before'', often quoting at the same time a whatever rock group from last century who unsuccessfully tried to diversify their musicians. <br />The Grissini Project as you maybe imagine it through your favorite video was never set in stone and counterexamples are plenty, in the project as outside of it. <br />For those who know Postmodern Jukebox or Scary Pockets, we have pretty similar career path and organisation.  <br /><br />Anyway! Beware the new faces in the coming months! <br />Today, those who saw us in concerts will recognize Lucy and Angelika. Still, it's a complete first time for Hillevi. <br />Please welcome them and send them the immeasurable amount of kindness and warmth they deserve. They are incredibly talented and hardworking, I'm very proud to show you the result of the hard work we've been putting it for this video! <br /><br />Cheers!<br />Grisisini<br />---<br />Call of Silence from Attack on Titan and emotional moment with Ymir.
