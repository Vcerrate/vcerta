{% raw %}I think that if you make everything your fault (without beating yourself up, of course), then you are also the person with the power to change things around.<br /><br />When you hold yourself accountable, it leads to solutions; it helps you maintain a position of control instead of being a victim. So many of you right now – in this exact second – are unhappy because you’re pointing fingers and feeling a lack of control.<br /><br />The lack of accountability leads to so much worse. If we can prop up accountability instead of shying away from it, we will be happier.<br /><br />— #garyvee #garyvaynerchuk #accountability<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br />Join My Discord!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.garyvee.com/discord">https://www.garyvee.com/discord</a><br />Check out another series on my channel:<br />Keynotes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vCDlmhRmBo&amp;list=PLfA33-E9P7FCEF1izpctGGoak841XYzrJ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vCDlmhRmBo&amp;list=PLfA33-E9P7FCEF1izpctGGoak841XYzrJ</a><br />NFTs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwMJ6bScB2s&amp;list=PLfA33-E9P7FAcvsVSFqzSuJhHu3SkW2Ma">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwMJ6bScB2s&amp;list=PLfA33-E9P7FAcvsVSFqzSuJhHu3SkW2Ma</a><br />Business Meetings: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wILI_VV6z4Y&amp;list=PLfA33-E9P7FCTIY62wkqZ-E1cwpc2hxBJ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wILI_VV6z4Y&amp;list=PLfA33-E9P7FCTIY62wkqZ-E1cwpc2hxBJ</a><br />Gary Vaynerchuk Original Films: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfA33-E9P7FAvnrOcgy4MvIcCXxoyjuku">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfA33-E9P7FAvnrOcgy4MvIcCXxoyjuku</a><br />Trash Talk: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfA33-E9P7FDelN4bXFgtJuczC9HHmm2-">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfA33-E9P7FDelN4bXFgtJuczC9HHmm2-</a><br />WeeklyVee: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfA33-E9P7FBPjdQcF6uedz9fdk8XKn-b">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfA33-E9P7FBPjdQcF6uedz9fdk8XKn-b</a><br />— <br />Gary Vaynerchuk is a serial entrepreneur, and serves as the Chairman of VaynerX,  the CEO of VaynerMedia and the Creator &amp; CEO of VeeFriends.<br /><br />Gary is considered one of the leading global minds on what’s next in culture,  relevance and the internet.
