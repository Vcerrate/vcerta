Ive been restoring it and fixing alot of the common issues such as the crack in the boot floor, rod bearings, oil leaks, worn bushes and much more. Yet it seems the more i repair the more i find that needs repairing. In this video i replace alot of worn parts and change them for upgraded parts in some cases from Mercedes AMG.<br /><br />‚¨áÔ∏è Steering Wheel Covers ‚¨áÔ∏è<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://autoaccessoryuk.co.uk/">https://autoaccessoryuk.co.uk/</a><br /><br />‚¨áÔ∏è Bilstein Suspension ‚¨áÔ∏è<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bilsteinuk/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/bilsteinuk/?hl=en</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bilsteinsuspensionstore.co.uk/">https://www.bilsteinsuspensionstore.co.uk/</a><br /><br />‚¨áÔ∏è FOR DISCOUNTED GENUINE BMW PARTS | BMW SYNTER LEICESTER ‚¨áÔ∏è<br />Email: parts.bmw.leicester@sytner.co.uk<br />Tel : 0116 2827711<br />(USE CODE MAT15)<br /><br />Check if your car was damaged with Car Vertical - 10% off here üëâ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.carvertical.com/gb/landing/britain?a=Matarmstrong&amp;b=1e4c9523&amp;voucher=Mat">https://www.carvertical.com/gb/landing/britain?a=Matarmstrong&amp;b=1e4c9523&amp;voucher=Mat</a> <br /><br />Carly's scanner and free version of the app with standard OBD features are compatible with cars that have an OBD2 port.
