{% raw %}How do we assuage an All-Powerful God who is provoked to wrath? When deep darkness is on people, man’s rebellious actions can provoke God to wrath.  Israel walked in that place provoking God over and over again.  Moses stood in the breach and so can we!  As in Moses’ days it will probably require the terror of the Lord to break through. As God’s present-day kings and priests, through prayer we can participate in activating God’s response in order to gain a harvest!  The truth of Revelation 1:5-6 forms the platform for the ‘Holy-Spirit’ demonstrations through the church!{% endraw %}
