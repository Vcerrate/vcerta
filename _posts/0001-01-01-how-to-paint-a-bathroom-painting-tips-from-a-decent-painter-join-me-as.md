{% raw %}Join me as I repaint my bathroom! It's definitely not the most exciting project in the world, but it needed to be done and it's a great excuse for me to share all of the tips I've learned from more experienced painters over the years. I'm definitely not the best painter in the world, but I've shadowed some very skilled painters and pestered them with a lot of questions. <br /><br />Support Me on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/zacbuilds">https://www.patreon.com/zacbuilds</a><br /><br />Check me out on INSTAGRAM - @ZacBuilds<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/zacbuilds">https://www.instagram.com/zacbuilds</a><br /><br />My favorite work clothes (and what I'm wearing in this video):  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.badnorthamerica.com">https://www.badnorthamerica.com</a> [Use Code zacbuilds10 for 10% off]<br /><br />Check out my website for all past projects:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.zacbuilds.com">https://www.zacbuilds.com</a><br /><br />All the tools and camera gear available here:  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.ca/shop/zacbuilds">https://www.amazon.ca/shop/zacbuilds</a>{% endraw %}
