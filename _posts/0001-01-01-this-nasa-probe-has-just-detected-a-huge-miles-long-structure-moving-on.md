{% raw %}This NASA probe has just detected a huge miles long structure moving on the surface of Mars. Today, we take a look at this interesting discovery made by NASA on Mars.<br /><br />Mars has long been a place of interest. NASA and other space agencies are gearing up to send humans to the red planet, hoping that one day we may even call this place home. Interestingly, in recent years various rovers and probes have found some interesting things on the surface, leading to photographs being shared around and theories being put forward.<br /><br />One photograph that was captured a while back shows what looks like large marks on the Mars surface....<br /><br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />Thank you to CO.AG for the background music!{% endraw %}
