{% raw %}History tells us that the birthplace of Jesus was Bethlehem. Matthew specifies “Bethlehem in Judea.” Luke tells us “Bethlehem, the town of David.” Why does this matter? Because it appears that this Bethlehem, about five and a half miles southwest of Jerusalem, is exactly where the Hebrew Scriptures predicted the Messiah would be born.<br /><br />“But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,<br />Though you are little among the thousands of Judah,<br />Yet out of you shall come forth to Me<br />The One to be Ruler in Israel,<br />Whose goings forth are from of old,<br />From everlasting.” (Micah 5:2)<br /><br />Bethlehem – the birthplace of Jesus -- was a very important location for the Jewish people. This is the town where King David was born about 1,000 years earlier, and it was the town where their foretold king – the One to be Ruler in Israel – needed to be born at some point in the future.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.drivethruhistory.com/birthplace-of-jesus/">http://www.drivethruhistory.com/birthplace-of-jesus/</a>{% endraw %}
