{% raw %}#JesusIsRejectedAtNazareth #Naaman #PeopleAsBlessings #Love #LessonsInLife<br /><br />TOPIC: ARE THERE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HURT YOU BUT HAVE CHANGED YOU POSITIVELY IN THE PROCESS?<br /><br />First Reading: 2 Kings 5:1-15AB<br />Responsorial Psalm: Psalms 42:2, 3; 43:3, 4<br />Verse Before the Gospel: Psalms 130:5, 7<br />Gospel: Luke 4:24-30<br /><br />Oftentimes, those who hurt us can be the ones who bless us. God has allowed us to encounter them so that we may be blessed in a different way, not in the ideal and loving way we envision, but in some painful and hurting way.<br /><br />This is the 713th installment of our CFC quarantine contemplation series focusing on the daily liturgical readings.  <br /><br />[NOTE: All the regular reflections are between 3-7 minutes long, enough time for us to ponder what God's message is for us individually and to pray that we may live them out in our lives. This video is also available on Couples for Christ’s  and Bong Arjonillo’s Facebook pages.  In You Tube, just type ONLY BY GRACE REFLECTIONS]{% endraw %}
