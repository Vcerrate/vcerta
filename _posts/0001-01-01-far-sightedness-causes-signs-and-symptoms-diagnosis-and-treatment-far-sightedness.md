{% raw %}Far-sightedness, also known as long-sightedness, hypermetropia, or hyperopia, is a condition of the eye where distant objects are seen clearly but near objects appear blurred. This blurred effect is due to incoming light being focused behind, instead of on, the retina wall due to insufficient accommodation by the lens.[6] Minor hypermetropia in young patients is usually corrected by their accommodation, without any defects in vision.[2] But, due to this accommodative effort for distant vision, people may complain of asthenopic symptoms during prolonged reading.[2] Some hypermetropes can see clear at distance, but near vision may be blurred due to insufficient accommodation. For this reason, this defect is referred as far-sightedness.[7] If the hypermetropia is high, there will be defective vision for both distance and near.[2] People may also experience accommodative dysfunction, binocular dysfunction, amblyopia, and strabismus.[3] Newborns are almost invariably hypermetropic, but it gradually decreases as the newborn gets older.[6]<br /><br />There are many causes for this condition. It may occur when the axial length of eyeball is too short or if the lens or cornea is flatter than normal.[2] Changes in refractive index of lens, alterations in position of the lens or absence of lens are the other main causes.[2] Risk factors include a family history of the condition, diabetes, certain medications, and tumors around the eye.[5][4] It is a type of refractive error.[5] Diagnosis is based on an eye exam.[5]<br /><br />Management can occur with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or refractive corneal surgeries.[2] Glasses are easiest while contact lenses can provide a wider field of vision.[2] Surgery works by changing the shape of the cornea.[5] Far-sightedness primarily affects young children, with rates of 8% at 6 years and 1% at 15 years.[8] It then becomes more common again after the age of 40, known as presbyopia, affecting about half of people.[4] Best treatment option to correct hypermetropia due to aphakia is IOL implantation.[2]<br /><br />Other common types of refractive errors are near-sightedness, astigmatism, and presbyopia.[9]{% endraw %}
