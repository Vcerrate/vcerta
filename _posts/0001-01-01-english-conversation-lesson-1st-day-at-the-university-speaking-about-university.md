{% raw %}English conversation Lesson -  1st Day at the University ( Speaking about University life)<br /><br />Blog : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.learnex.in/english-conversation-lesson-university-life">http://www.learnex.in/english-conversation-lesson-university-life</a><br /><br />If you are studying in the university, entering a university or are interested to know about my two friends at the university then continue watching this Spoken English lesson. I am your English Teacher Michelle and we are going to learn how to talk to new ESL students at the university. This is one of the earliest English conversations between Billy and Jack at the university. When they first met each other the conversation was quite formal and introductory and so would it be, if you also meet your classmate/college mate for the first time at the university.<br /><br />Website : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.letstalkpodcast.com">http://www.letstalkpodcast.com</a><br />Facebook  : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/letstalkpodcast">http://www.facebook.com/letstalkpodcast</a><br /><br />Conversation 01<br /><br />Billy – Hey!
