It gives him the opportunity to perform some insane outplays, and just generally be more viable inside ranked queue. Add the buffs to the newest map Breeze and he honestly becomes an A-tier pick, when before he was hated by almost all. If you want to learn how to play Yoru, I post guides as often as I can, so hopefully, you enjoy those, I also post a lot of Yoru Outplay highlights/montages if that's also something you are interested in. Thanks for takin the time to read/watch, enjoy the rest of your day.<br /><br />COPYRIGHT<br />I do not own any songs used in this video, this video is meant for entertainment purposes only.{% endraw %}
