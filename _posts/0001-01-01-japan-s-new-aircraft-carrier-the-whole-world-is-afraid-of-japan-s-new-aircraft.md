{% raw %}Japan's New Aircraft Carrier The Whole World Is Afraid Of<br /><br />Japan is the only country in the world that has been banned from having its own army at the constitutional level since the Second World War in exchange for a guarantee of sovereignty by the United States.<br /><br />But despite the military restrictions, the Land of the Rising Sun intends to create a new generation aircraft carrier based on the Izumo-class helicopter carriers of the Japanese Navy.<br /><br />What will this ship be like, and will it be able to strengthen the country's defense capability?{% endraw %}
