{% raw %}One of the very first signs you might have the Omicron variant<br /><br />A sore throat is one of the earliest signs of having the Omicron variant, according to experts.<br /><br />The Covid symptom will usually appear in the first week of illness and improve quite quickly.<br /><br />Professor Tim Spector, the scientist behind symptom tracker app Zoe, says the symptom will feel worse on the first day of infection but get better on each following day.<br /><br />On average, a sore throat will last two to three days but can last longer in adults.<br /><br />If a sore throat is persisting, it’s unlikely to be Covid.<br /><br />Almost half of people who are ill with Covid will experience a sore throat. However, it’s more common in adults aged 18 to 65 than the elderly and those under 18.<br /><br />Around 11 per cent of people who were ill with Covid reported a sore throat as their only symptom.<br /><br />The mutant variant continues to sweep the nation with cold-like symptoms.<br /><br />There are over 100,000 new cases being registered each and every single day in the UK currently.<br /><br />The Manchester Evening News covers news, entertainment, sport, and what's happening around the region - and has done since 1868. <br /><br />Follow us on our social channels<br /><br />Twitter – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mennewsdesk">https://twitter.com/mennewsdesk</a><br />Facebook – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews/">https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews/</a><br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instragram.com/ManchesterEveningNews/">https://www.instragram.com/ManchesterEveningNews/</a><br />LinkedIn - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/manchestereveningnewsbusiness">https://www.linkedin.com/company/manchestereveningnewsbusiness</a><br /><br />Visit our homepage and see what's going on – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/">https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/</a><br /><br />If you have a story tip or something you feel we should be investigating, you can email newsdesk@men-news.co.uk or call on 0161 832 7200. <br /><br />LIKE | COMMENT | SUBSCRIBE<br /><br />#uknews #latestnews #covid19{% endraw %}
