{% raw %}While terms such as communism, fascism, nationalism, anarchism, liberalism, and conservatism will be familiar to many people, the precise history behind these various &quot;political ideologies&quot; remains obscure to most, as will the political philosophy and the work by philosophers such as Jean Jacques Rousseau, John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Edmund Burke, Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, and Giovanni Gentile.<br />Ideologies consist of four elements: a narrative explanation of the present, a set of moral criteria for the evaluation of facts, an orientation of the ideology's adherents towards their role in the world, and a political program for the immediate future.<br /><br />Guest speakers in this video included fellow content creators POLARSWORLD and Arken the Amerikan, as well as my buddies Fraus and Zander.
