{% raw %}The Great Glen Way travels for 79miles from Fort William to Inverness along the Great Glen. It passes Loch Lochy, Loch Oich and Loch Ness, as well as the grand Caledonian Canal. It's crammed with historical sites and beautiful forests, and whilst the route may mostly be flat (perfect for anyone new to backpacking), the climbs that do appear offer the most magnificent views as a reward. It is a truly engaging walk, and like always, has a lot to teach the open-hearted walker...<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.spendmoretimeinthewild.co.uk">https://www.spendmoretimeinthewild.co.uk</a><br /><br />Here at Spend More Time In The WILD we are not afraid to dream big but we need people like you to help see our projects to life.
