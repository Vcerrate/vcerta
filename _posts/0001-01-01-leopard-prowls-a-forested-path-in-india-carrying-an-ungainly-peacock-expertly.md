{% raw %}This leopard has just managed to get to a peacock and walks across a forest path with its catch. The tail feathers get in its way, between the leopard's legs! The remaining flock of peafowl create a ruckus and follow the leopard that has just taken away their flock member. Meal consumed, the leopard expertly jumps across a series of fences and crosses a jungle path, to get to the other side.<br /><br />This footage is part of the broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.
