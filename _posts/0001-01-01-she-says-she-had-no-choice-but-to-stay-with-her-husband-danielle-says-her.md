{% raw %}Danielle says her marriage to her husband, Josh, is “totally toxic.” She claims not only has he repeatedly cheated on her, but he’s also physically abusive and has shoved a bleach-soaked rag down her throat and choked her to the point where she thought she was going to die. Danielle, who is 13-weeks pregnant, says this has all occurred in front of their two young children. Josh claims Danielle blames him for everything wrong in their marriage, and it's “unfair.” Josh also claims he’s bipolar, which is what causes him to become physical with Danielle and to cheat on her. But Danielle says Josh is using his bipolar disorder to excuse all his bad behavior. Can Dr. Phil help save this marriage on the brink? Find out!
