{% raw %}Today we are back to logging with the horses! Jim has some extra help in the woods today with Brenda filming, and our Amish neighbor, Andy,  skidding logs out of the woods with the Percheron team, Ken &amp; Buck. Jim is using the Belgian team, Lady &amp; Bill. Jim also shares a history of this log job that he has been working at for several years, just down the road from our farm! <br /><br />Link to Brenda's boots ►   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3rnllq1">https://amzn.to/3rnllq1</a><br /><br />Watch our videos to learn about draft horses- horse logging, horses farming, and horse training! Jim uses Belgian, Percheron, and Suffolk horses to do work on the farm and in the woods. He teaches about harnesses, horse-drawn logging and farming equipment, horse feeding and maintenance, and voice commands for horses. New videos uploaded every week. Keep watching to see how Jim trains his new Suffolk Punch colts as he has trained his full-grown teams! <br /><br />Our Horses<br />Belgian team ►   Lady &amp; Bill<br />Percheron team ►   Ken &amp; Buck<br />Suffolk Punch team ►   Duke &amp; Earl<br /><br />Subscribe -  It's FREE! ►   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/workinghorseswithjim">https://www.youtube.com/workinghorseswithjim</a><br />Please like, leave a comment, subscribe, and tap the bell for video reminders! <br /><br />Website ►   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.workinghorseswithjim.com">https://www.workinghorseswithjim.com</a><br />Merchandise  ►   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.workinghorseswithjim.com/shop">https://www.workinghorseswithjim.com/shop</a><br />Brenda's Blog ►   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.workinghorseswithjim.com/blog">https://www.workinghorseswithjim.com/blog</a><br />Patreon ►   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/workinghorseswithjim">https://www.patreon.com/workinghorseswithjim</a><br />Instagram ►  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/workinghorseswithjim/">https://www.instagram.com/workinghorseswithjim/</a><br />Facebook ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/workinghorseswithjim">https://www.facebook.com/workinghorseswithjim</a><br />Amazon Affiliate Store ►   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/workinghorseswithjim">https://www.amazon.com/shop/workinghorseswithjim</a><br />Paypal ►   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/workinghorseswithjim">https://paypal.me/workinghorseswithjim</a><br /><br />Our Filming Equipment<br />Go Pro 7 ►   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2QyOLlX​">https://amzn.to/2QyOLlX​</a><br />Go Pro 9 ►   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3vurlx9">https://amzn.to/3vurlx9</a><br />Drone ►   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3dpufNW">https://amzn.to/3dpufNW</a><br />Wireless Mics ►   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3koPgva">https://amzn.to/3koPgva</a><br /><br />Contact Us! <br />Email ►   workinghorseswithjim@yahoo.com<br />Mailing Address ►   Jim Gordon P.O.
