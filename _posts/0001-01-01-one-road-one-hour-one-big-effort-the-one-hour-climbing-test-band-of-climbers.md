{% raw %}Band of Climbers launched a challenge for January, how many meters can you climb in one hour, WITHOUT using the same road twice! <br /><br />Please like and comment, it helps me know if you enjoyed the content and the effort too, so I can make more!!<br /><br />My ride - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.strava.com/activities/6557817998">https://www.strava.com/activities/6557817998</a><br /><br />Riding a bike uphill can be miserable for everyone, and can be the ultimate test for cycling. Otherwise known as VAM, this value is an important metric that pro cyclists can use to measure their effort. As you know, I love anything to do with going uphill...and then blasting down again! <br /><br />Drop a LIKE and enjoy! <br /><br />Thank you for watching this video. I hope that you keep up with the regular videos I post on the channel, subscribe, and share your learnings with those that need to hear it. Your comments are important to me, so please take a second and say ‚ÄòHey‚Äô ;).<br /><br />Ed is an elite cyclist, 2019 British Hill Climb Champion and former Under 23 British RR Champion. He has raced as a Continental level Professional Rider in Japan, Korea, Australia, Canada, Azerbaijan to name a few. He is also a public speaker, coach, and remains grounded with regular returns to his roots at Bynea Cycling Club. At the start of 2021, the Discord community began, and plonked many of Ed's viewers in to a 350+ strong group of people that had many things in common. Not least wanting to explore the world and pedal their bikes faster!<br /><br />Ed coaches lots of cyclists in the online community too! If you are interested, email laverackcoaching@yahoo.com for information on the 1-2-1 coaching package and training plans, of which there are many!<br /><br />Ed now prioritises having fun with my hard earned fitness and knowledge in the sport. Showcasing that maybe there is an alternative to racing for teams when you can race for yourself and your community of followers and brands. This YouTube channel is a docu-series highlighting what it‚Äôs like to be a cyclist in today‚Äôs competitive age of sport. <br />--<br />Follow Me Online Here:<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/edlaverack">http://instagram.com/edlaverack</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/edlaverack">https://twitter.com/edlaverack</a>  <br />Strava: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.strava.com/pros/47597">https://www.strava.com/pros/47597</a> <br /><br />F I N D   M E...<br />üçå MY STRAVA <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.strava.com/pros/47597">https://www.strava.com/pros/47597</a> <br />üì∏ INSTAGRAM <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/edlaverack">http://instagram.com/edlaverack</a> <br />üíô FACEBOOK @iamedlaverack<br />ü§ñ TWITTER <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/edlaverack">https://twitter.com/edlaverack</a><br /><br />Special thanks to my supporters - <br />- Clifton Coffee - ED15 for 15% OFF COFFEE on our website.
