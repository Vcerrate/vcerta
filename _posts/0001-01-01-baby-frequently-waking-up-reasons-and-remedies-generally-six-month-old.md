{% raw %}Generally, six-month-old babies and younger infants have a short-sleeping cycle. Babies don’t have a sound sleep. After a chunk of rest, they wake up and drift off to sleep again. Some babies wake up every hour. They slowly learn to sleep for longer stretches and master how to lull or soothe themselves to sleep. <br /><br />Although frequent waking in babies is a common phenomenon, it could be linked to other reasons like hunger or teething. This video has some reasons and remedies about the same and will help you help your baby to have a sound sleep. So if your baby wakes up constantly in the night, these remedies will be helpful. However, if your baby wakes up frequently in the middle of the night, we suggest you consult your baby’s paediatrician and follow their advice.<br /><br />#BabyFrequentlyWakingUp #WhatToDoIfABabyWakesUpFrequently #BabyWakesUpConstantlyInTheNight #BabyWakesUpEveryHour <br /><br />For More Information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/frequent-waking-in-babies-reasons-and-remedies/">https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/frequent-waking-in-babies-reasons-and-remedies/</a><br /><br />Like, comment, and share with Your family and friends.<br /><br />FirstCry Parenting helps you through your journey of Getting Pregnant, Pregnancy &amp; Parenting.
