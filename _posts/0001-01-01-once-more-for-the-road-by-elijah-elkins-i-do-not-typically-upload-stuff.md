{% raw %}I do not typically upload stuff like this, but this song my son Elijah sang at our recent annual meetings was just too much not to share. It was written by David Patillo about a man who had decided it was just too hard to serve the Lord so he was going to quit. However, he loved the Lord, so he at least wanted to thank the Lord one more time for all He had done for him. However, the more he thanked the Lord, the more he realized he couldn't live without Him. Sometimes all we need to do is thank God for the things He has done to realize He's still there, still able, and still in control. God bless you saints!<br /><br />Bro Jeff<br /><br />This road has been a rocky one<br />At times I thought all help was gone<br />But somehow You were always there to see me though<br />In situations of despair<br />I called and always found You there<br />I must confess, Your Love for me has been true<br /><br />I just don't have a reason, that would justify my leaving, all this way of life I've known with You behind<br />But like a long day in the summer sun<br />This walk of life becomes a run<br />And quitting time weighs heavy on my mind<br /><br />But it's one more &quot;I love You Jesus&quot;<br />One more &quot;Thanks for helping bear my load&quot;<br />One more time I will thank You for the things You have done<br />Let me thank You once more for the road...<br /><br />This road has been a rocky one<br />But then again, I've had a lot of fun<br />If I compare I know the good outweighs the bad<br />A foe or two along the way<br />I guess a few are here to stay<br />But thank You for the faithful Friend I've had<br /><br />Now there have been times I said I'd quit<br />But I am not that crazy yet<br />For You have been the Dearest Friend of mine<br />Just let me get down on my knees and pray<br />And everything will be Ok<br />Without You Lord I know I'd lost my mind{% endraw %}
