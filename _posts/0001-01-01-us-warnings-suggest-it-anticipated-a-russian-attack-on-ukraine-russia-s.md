{% raw %}Russia's invasion of Ukraine in a sense, may have been preordained given that US sanctions were mounting and Ukraine was refusing to return to the Minsk Accords that offered a solution to the current crisis.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this conversation on The Gist, Velina Tchakarova, director of the Austrian Institute for European &amp; Security Policy, provides a perspective of how far or how long Russia's military operations in Ukraine could go, and what President Putin wants to achieve. He has indicated no plans to occupy Ukraine.<br /><br /><br /><br />At this point it appears the US has no intention of militarily challenging Russia's armed intervention in Ukraine, then sanctions apart, does it suggest Washington has no further interest in Ukraine. As for Europe, it is now solidly behind the US with really no where to go. Does that mean the US will be free to focus on China? <br /><br /><br /><br />Tune in for more in this conversation with Velina Tchakarova.{% endraw %}
