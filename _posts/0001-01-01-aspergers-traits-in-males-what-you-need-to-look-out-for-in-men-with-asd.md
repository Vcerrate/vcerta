{% raw %}Thank you for checking out my video on Asperger's traits in males. <br />In this video I talk about some of the traits of Aspergers syndrome in men: from the perspective of an adult who has the disorder.<br /><br />We discuss social communication issues. <br />Issues with imagination, and imaginative play.<br />We talk about physical repetitive motor behaviours.<br />finally, we discuss anger/rage in meltdowns that very often are expressed in physically aggressive ways.<br /><br />If you really want to show your support for the channel, I have a Patreon page  --  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/AdamWonders">https://www.patreon.com/AdamWonders</a><br /><br />My name is Adam, and I suffered clinical depression for well over 10 years; I thankfully was able to recover and go to university to study Psychology, where I discovered (and have now been diagnosed) that I have Asperger's Syndrome!<br /><br />My particular interest is in mental health, mental illnesses, and general mental wellbeing. I regularly upload videos on these topics, so come and join one of the most all-inclusive and accepting communities on YouTube! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y4yab8cr">https://tinyurl.com/y4yab8cr</a><br /><br />Tags: #MaleAspergersTraits #MenWithAspergers #RealPsychology{% endraw %}
