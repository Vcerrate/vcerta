So, here is the answer. There aren't any side effects listening to our music. But we suggest the sound level coming through your headphones shouldn't be set too high, otherwise, it can cause hearing loss. It could also be a problem if you have epilepsy, so before trying it, you should speak to your doctor.<br /><br />Love From Good Vibes❤<br />#goodvibesofficial #openendlesspossibilities #binauralbeats #bringmiracles #888hz<br /><br />PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL &amp; Click the bell icon (🔔) to get the notification of regular updates...<br /><br />Download our app to listen to our music offline<br /> 📱Download Android App: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Fk1qAe">http://bit.ly/2Fk1qAe</a><br /> 📱Download Our IOS APP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/2Vvk0A1">https://apple.co/2Vvk0A1</a><br /><br />Connect with Us<br />    Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2yGkp8x">https://bit.ly/2yGkp8x</a><br />    Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/34hH4DK">https://bit.ly/34hH4DK</a><br />    Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3c480tp">https://bit.ly/3c480tp</a><br /><br />The elements used in this video are licensed from, Videoblocks, Freepik, and have been re-edited by us.<br /><br />© Good Vibes all rights reserved.{% endraw %}
