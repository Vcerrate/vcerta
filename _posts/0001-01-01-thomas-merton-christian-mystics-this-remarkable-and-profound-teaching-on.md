{% raw %}This remarkable and profound teaching on modes of contemplation by Thomas Merton, is from the chapter, Pure Love from the text &quot;Seeds of Contemplation.&quot; <br /><br />Thomas Merton  (January 31, 1915 – December 10, 1968) was an American Trappist monk, writer, theologian, mystic, poet, social activist, and scholar of comparative religion. On May 26, 1949, he was ordained to the priesthood and given the name &quot;Father Louis&quot;. Merton wrote more than 50 books in a period of 27 years, mostly on spirituality, social justice and a quiet pacifism, as well as scores of essays and reviews.<br /><br />Music credits: &quot;Monoku&quot; - Earlyguard<br />_______________________________________<br /><br />🙏 May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.<br /><br />🔆 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
