{% raw %}Edit: RIP Afrobeat true legend, your music was an inspiration for me through my life since i've listened to you with Fela Kuti for the first time. You, throughout your music and drum lines, will never be missed. Thank you so much for everything. <br /><br />From the 2014 album called Film of Life. This is the unedited album version. <br /><br />Release: Offering an exciting sneak preview of Film of Life, the new album from Tony Allen due for release next October on JazzVillage, the poignant ballad &quot;Go Back&quot; was written with Damon Albarn, who features on vocals and keyboards. Set to a sensual and hypnotic beat, the two musicians have created a homage to the African refugees who ended up on the Italian island of Lampedusa. This is a dazzling new masterpiece to add to the collective adventures of the brilliant English jack-of-all-trades and the cult Nigerian drummer, whose paths first crossed over ten years ago for the album Homecooking, followed by The Good, the Bad and the Queen and Africa Express.<br /><br />I do not own the rights of this song.{% endraw %}
