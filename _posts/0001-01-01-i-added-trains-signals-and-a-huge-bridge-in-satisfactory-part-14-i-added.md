It is a 3D first-person open world exploration and factory building game. The player, a pioneer, is dropped onto an alien planet with a handful of tools and must harvest the planet's natural resources to construct increasingly complex factories for automating all resource needs. The initial goal is to build a space elevator and begin supplying the company the player works for (FICSIT Inc.) with increasingly numerous and complex components for their unknown purposes.<br /><br />** Intro/Outro Song **<br />TheFatRat - Origin<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/gZIDNZh9U14">https://youtu.be/gZIDNZh9U14</a><br /><br />#Satisfactory<br />#Update5<br />#CoffeeStain{% endraw %}
