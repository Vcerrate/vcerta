{% raw %}This Video is all about stainless steel Matte/Satin finish. In this tutorial, I am guiding you on how you can achieve mat finish with the simple grinder and drill machine. I regularly experiment with stainless steel, and regularly onto my channel I make stainless steel stuff. What I experience I express the things with such tutorials.<br /><br />𝐁𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐡𝐞𝐝, 𝐃𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐨𝐫 𝐒𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐬𝐡<br />Architectural Finish is characterized by fine polishing grit lines that are uniform and directional in appearance. It is produced by polishing the metal with an 80- 180 grit belt or wheel finish. (65 RA – 30 RA)<br /><br />𝐃𝐚𝐢𝐫𝐲 𝐨𝐫 𝐒𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐬𝐡<br />This finish is commonly used for the medical and food industry – almost exclusively used on stainless steel. Great care should be taken in removing the surface defects in the metal – like pits – that could allow bacteria to grow. This finish is produced by polishing with a 180 – 240 grit belt. (30 RA – 20 RA)<br /><br />𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐬𝐡<br />Fine-grain. This finish is produced by polishing with a 180 – 280 grit belt. (20 RA – 12 RA). Smooth buffed finish with a very bright appearance. Light haze. The part is belt polished with a 280 – 320 belt then buffed with a cut and color compound. This is a common finish in preparation for chrome plating, powder coating, anodizing, etc. This is a good way to keep polishing costs down when a part needs to be shiny but not flawless.<br /><br />𝐌𝐢𝐫𝐫𝐨𝐫 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐬𝐡<br />“Mirror” bright finishes with clear reflection – Very light haze. All surface defects are removed. The part is buffed and then color buffed to achieve a mirror finish. The quality of this finish can depend on the quality of the metal being polished. Castings that have pits will be difficult – if not impossible polish to a Mirror Finish<br /><br />𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐃𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐑𝐚 𝐌𝐞𝐚𝐧?<br />As described in ASME B46.1, Ra is the arithmetic average of the absolute values of the profile height deviations from the mean line, recorded within the evaluation length. Simply put, Ra is the average of a set of individual measurements of a surface's peaks and valleys.
