Each type is served on two overlapped small tortillas and sometimes garnished with guacamole, salsa, onions, and cilantro (coriander leaf). Also, prepared on the grill is a sandwiched taco called mulita (&quot;little mule&quot;) made with meat served between two tortillas and garnished with Oaxaca style cheese. &quot;Mulita&quot; is used to describe these types of sandwiched tacos in the Northern States of Mexico while they are known as Gringa in the Mexican south and are prepared using wheat flour tortillas. Tacos may also be served with salsa.<br /><br />Tacos de cabeza (&quot;head tacos&quot;), in which there is a flat punctured metal plate from which steam emerges to cook the head of the cow. These include: Cabeza, a serving of the muscles of the head; Sesos (&quot;brains&quot;); Lengua (&quot;tongue&quot;); Cachete (&quot;cheeks&quot;); Trompa (&quot;lips&quot;); and, Ojo (&quot;eye&quot;). Tortillas for these tacos are warmed on the same steaming plate for a different consistency. These tacos are typically served in pairs, and also include salsa, onion, and cilantro (coriander leaf) with occasional use of guacamole.[13][14]<br />Tacos de camarones (&quot;shrimp tacos&quot;) also originated in Baja California in Mexico. Grilled or fried shrimp are used, usually with the same accompaniments as fish tacos: lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, avocado and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla.<br /><br />Tacos de cazo (literally &quot;bucket tacos&quot;) for which a metal bowl filled with lard is typically used as a deep-fryer. Meats for these types of tacos typically include Tripa (&quot;tripe&quot;, usually from a pig instead of a cow, and can also refer to the intestines); Suadero (tender beef cuts), Carnitas and Buche (Literally, &quot;crop&quot;, as in bird's crop; or the esophagus of any animal.<br /><br />Tacos de lengua (beef tongue tacos),which are cooked in water with onions, garlic, and bay leaves for several hours until tender and soft, then sliced and sautéed in a small amount of oil. &quot;It is said that unless a taqueria offers tacos de lengua, it is not a real taqueria.&quot;[18]<br /><br />Two fish tacos in Bonita, California<br />Tacos de pescado (&quot;fish tacos&quot;) originated in Baja California in Mexico, where they consist of grilled or fried fish, lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla. In the United States, they were first popularized by the Rubio's fast-food chain, and remain most popular in California, Colorado, and Washington. In California, they are often found at street vendors, and a regional variation is to serve them with cabbage and coleslaw dressing on top.<br /><br />Tacos dorados (fried tacos; literally, &quot;golden tacos&quot;) called flautas (&quot;flute&quot;, because of the shape), or taquitos, for which the tortillas are filled with pre-cooked shredded chicken, beef or barbacoa, rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep-fried until crisp. They are sometimes cooked in a microwave oven or broiled.<br /><br />We don’t mess around when it comes to tacos. Whether it’s Taco Tuesday, Cinco de Mayo, or just another weeknight, tacos show up on our kitchen table more often than we’d like to admit. We love how wrapping pretty much anything in a corn tortilla or flour tortilla turns it into a killer meal. <br />#tacorecipe #tacos #easytacorecipe{% endraw %}
