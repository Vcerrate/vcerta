{% raw %}Welcome ladies and gentlemen to Plague Inc A fun little plague simulator which demonstrates at least a partially educational look at the spread of a disease in a entertaining way. It is by no means an accurate game but it does encourage more people to enter the field of epidemiology. Now today The Spiffing Brit will be discovering if Plague Inc is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or if unlocking all the genes instantly to create overpowered combos is broken. So its time to sit back relax and grab a cup of tea as that funny british man finds unique developer approved game mechanics to exploit and glitch the system in his favour creating some very funny moments for us all. <br /><br />What you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. <br /><br />So sit back relax and enjoy Plague Inc in 2020 with an infinite gene exploit! <br /><br />Magestic Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://freshmerch.fm/collections/spiffing-brit">https://freshmerch.fm/collections/spiffing-brit</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing">https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing</a><br />Twitter: @thespiffingbrit<br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/spiffing">https://discord.gg/spiffing</a><br /><br />Title: Plague Inc Is A Perfectly Balanced Game With No Exploits - Unlock All Genes Instantly<br /><br />#funny #montage #glitch{% endraw %}
