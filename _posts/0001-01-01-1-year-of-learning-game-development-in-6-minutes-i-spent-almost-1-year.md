That means I had to learn c#, how to make game assets, and a billion other things.  I've made 5 games so far: a 2d hack and slash game, a voice-controlled platformer, a tower builder for androids, a 3d RPG gladiators game, and a 3d puzzle game. How did I do all of that? Well, youtube is full of great game dev videos, and... ok ok, it was brackeys.<br /><br />● About<br />Digging deep, huh? I am an indie game developer and self-taught(don't know much) programmer and artist. I make videos about games I make in Unity's game engine, drawing game assets, and everything related to games in general. If you are an epic gamer yourself you should join my journey and be a part of it!<br /><br />● Music<br />Intro song : Blitz - Retro Gaming Version [Royalty Free]<br />Music provided and produced by LonePeakMusic <br />Link : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/bn-9FFT3KZM">https://youtu.be/bn-9FFT3KZM</a><br /><br />Renaissance by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://audionautix.com/">http://audionautix.com/</a><br /><br />#gamedev #unity #giedzilla #makegames #unity3d #rpg{% endraw %}
