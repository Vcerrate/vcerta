{% raw %}Yooooooooooo<br /><br />New Video with CJ dropping today at 7am PST !!<br />One of Cj's goals this year was to land a backflip on dirt, and well, it only took him a couple months of being in the Into The Gnar Progression team to succeed. So my brain, and my ego told me that, if he can do it, there is no reason that I can't. Hahahaha!!!<br /><br />Join us, CJ, Steve and I, in this video at the Airrec center, on our big bikes, and watch us go upside down !!<br />Cj's progression has been completely crazy so far and it's amazing to see. The kid rides everyday, and his passion for biking only keeps on growing. <br /><br />We are registered for some DH and enduro for the season, it's gonna be sick.<br /><br />Our partners <br /><br />Guerrilla Gravity<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ridegg.com​​​">https://ridegg.com​​​</a><br />Industry Nine<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://industrynine.com​​​">https://industrynine.com​​​</a><br />PNW components<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pnwcomponents.com​​​">https://www.pnwcomponents.com​​​</a><br />North Shore Billet<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://northshorebillet.ca​​​">https://northshorebillet.ca​​​</a><br />Hutchinson tires<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hutchinsontires.com/en/ho...">https://www.hutchinsontires.com/en/ho...</a><br />Dissent Lab<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dissentlabs.com">https://www.dissentlabs.com</a><br />Ride 100 percent<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.100percent.com​​​">https://www.100percent.com​​​</a><br />Ride wrap<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ridewrap.ca​​​">https://www.ridewrap.ca​​​</a><br />NF Clothing<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ridenf.com">https://www.ridenf.com</a><br />EXT<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.extremeshox.com/mtbproducts/">https://www.extremeshox.com/mtbproducts/</a><br />TRP<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://trpcycling.com">https://trpcycling.com</a><br />WPL<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wplbike.com">https://wplbike.com</a><br />LOLO RACKS<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://loloracks.com">https://loloracks.com</a><br />SDG COMPONENTS<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sdgcomponents.com">https://sdgcomponents.com</a><br /><br />See you on the trails <br /><br />YoB{% endraw %}
