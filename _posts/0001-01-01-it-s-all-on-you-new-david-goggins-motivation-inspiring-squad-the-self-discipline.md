{% raw %}The Self-Discipline is the one thing that made David Goggins into the men he is today. The SELF part is very important, it all comes down to you, are you willing to suffer, suffering is the only way to grow. But when you decide for yourself to go the distance, to push hard, to go through resistance you will discover that you have no limits. Your potential is near limitless. You can only change you, it is you vs you, Stay hard and keep grinding, even if you don't feel like doing it.<br /><br />ðŸ”¥ The best Motivational Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3McP7ao">https://bit.ly/3McP7ao</a><br /><br />Speakers: <br />ðŸ‘‰ David Goggins <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://davidgoggins.com/">https://davidgoggins.com/</a><br />ðŸ‘‰ Jocko Willink <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JockoPodcastOfficial/videos">https://www.youtube.com/c/JockoPodcastOfficial/videos</a><br />ðŸ‘‰ Eric Thomas <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/etthehiphoppreacher/videos">https://www.youtube.com/c/etthehiphoppreacher/videos</a><br /><br />ðŸ‘‰About us:<br />The Inspiring Squad is a place where you can stay motivated and take charge of your life!
