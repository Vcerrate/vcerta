{% raw %}#ItIsWell #BethelMusic <br /><br />Lyrics:<br />Grander earth has quaked before<br />Moved by the sound of His voice<br />Seas that are shaken and stirred<br />Can be calmed and broken for my regard<br />And through it all, through it all<br />My eyes are on You<br />And through it all, through it all<br />It is well<br />And through it all, through it all<br />My eyes are on You<br />And it is well with me<br />And far be it from me to not believe<br />Even when my eyes can't see<br />And this mountain that's in front of me<br />Will be thrown into the midst of the sea<br />And through it all, through it all<br />My eyes are on You<br />And through it all, through it all<br />It is well<br />And through it all, through it all<br />My eyes are on You<br />And it is well<br />It is well<br />So let go my soul and trust in Him<br />The waves and wind still know His name<br />So let go my soul and trust in Him<br />The waves and wind still know His name<br />So let go my soul and trust in Him<br />The waves and wind still know His name<br />The waves and wind still know His name<br />And it is well with my soul (sing it, everybody)<br />It is well with my soul<br />It is well with my soul<br />It is well<br />It is well with my soul<br />Oh it is well with my soul ('cause of who you are)<br />Oh it is well with my soul<br />It is well with my soul<br />It is well<br />It is well with my soul<br />It is well<br />It is well with my soul<br />It is well<br />It is well with my soul<br />And through it all, through it all<br />My eyes are on You<br />And through it all, through it all<br />It is well, Lord<br />And through it all, through it all<br />My eyes are on You<br />And it is well with me{% endraw %}
