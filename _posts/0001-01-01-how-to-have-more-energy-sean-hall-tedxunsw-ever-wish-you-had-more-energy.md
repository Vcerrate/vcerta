{% raw %}Ever wish you had more energy? Or wonder why you’re so tired? Energx Founder Sean Hall introduces us to seven ‘energy crisis indicators’ that are likely to be depleting you, and millions like you, today. Cumulatively, these surprisingly everyday indicators have resulted in a human ‘energy crisis’ of epidemic proportions. Our health, happiness, and the economy are suffering, and it's impacting our ability to drive social change. After researching the root cause, Sean created the skill of ‘energy intelligence’ or ‘ExIQ’. In this talk he shows how this can help us, practically and immediately, find more energy for what matters. Sean is an awarded marketer, innovator and strategist with twenty years of leadership experience ranging from Global Marketing Manager for Les Mills, the creator of the world’s most popular workouts through to senior executive roles in marketing and HR at $12B Top 20 Global Telco brand Telstra.<br /><br />After suffering burnout or an ‘energy crisis’ twice in three years, Sean developed a deep understanding and fascination with energy and wellness at both a personal and professional level.<br /><br />As Founder and CEO of performance coaching company Energx, Sean is on a mission to change that by helping Australian’s build their energy intelligence so that they are more able to identify and deal with the stresses that deplete their energy. He believes building energy intelligence is the key to a healthy, happy, inclusive society.<br /><br />The symptoms of chronic stress and energy depletion are all around us. All at once we are experiencing an ‘epidemic of epidemics’ ranging from obesity, depression, bullying, addiction, and loneliness to sleep deprivation and heart disease. Sean believes a key contributor to this is that we have never been taught what impacts our personal energy on a physical, mental, emotional and spiritual level.<br /><br />Sean is passionate about the role of technology in addressing matters of social equity, a mentor to TEDxUNSW, Project ROCKIT and Youth Off The Streets and an alumni scholar of The Marketing Academy. His first book focused on personal energy and wellness, BOOM! Why Energy Intelligence Is The Key To A Successful Life will be published in 2017. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
