You see, I have a history of building the biggest projects on YouTube (SpongeBob's House in my Backyard, Real Life Technoblade, Giant Cereal Bowl in my Bedroom, and a Real Life Squid Games Doll), but I've never built something edible. Thatâ€™s exactly why I decided I had to build MrBeast three of the worldâ€™s largest candy bars every built. I built one chocolate bar in each of the flavors that Feastables launched on day one: Original Chocolate, Quinoa Crunch Chocolate, and Almond Chocolate. To top things off, we only had 7 days to build them. We ended up ordering over 1,000 pounds of chocolate to make these bars and they turned out incredible! We delivered them across the country to North Carolina to surprise Jimmy just in time for the big reveal. He was AMAZED at how good they turned out! This was a real challenge to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. <br /><br />If youâ€™re reading this youâ€™re a real one! <br />Comment â€˜â€™I love chocolate!&quot; so I can notice you!<br /><br />Not Worldâ€™s Most Dangerous Escape Room!, But How MrBeast Launched His Own Snacks Brand (Feastables), But $100,000, But In The Circle, But Extreme Hide and Seek, But 1,000 times, But Buried Alive, But Last to Leave, But 24 Hours, But 50 Hours, But Squid Game, or any other video like MrBeast, ZHC, Stokes Twins, Ben Azelart, Lexi Rivera, Brent Rivera, Pierson, Faze Rug, Carter Sharer, Preston, Unspeakable, Brianna, or Ryan Prunty would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) surprises MrBeast (aka Jimmy Donaldson) with three of the worldâ€™s largest chocolate bars for the launch of his Feastables candy company!{% endraw %}
