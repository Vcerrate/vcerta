{% raw %}Thank you to everyone who took part in our Primary Sports Day this year and made the event successful! We couldnâ€™t have done it without your help. The children have really enjoyed the activities; they surely have learned a lot about healthy competition, teamwork and camaraderie.{% endraw %}
