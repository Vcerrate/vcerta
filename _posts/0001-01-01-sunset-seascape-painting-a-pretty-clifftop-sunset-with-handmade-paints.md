Today I'll be painting this lovely soft sunset scene for you, with a light path over the water. To paint this, I'll be using colours from Batch 2 of Davidson's Pigments small batch artisan hand made watercolour paints! These paints are simply lovely, highly pigmented and really great quality - and I should know, I helped make them!! Please follow the link above to my Etsy Store, MorgaineRoseArt, to find out more. <br /><br />Equipment list: today I'm using Saunders Waterford cold pressed 100% cotton paper, high white, 140lb weight, cut into a quarter of an imperial sheet. My colours are: Permanent Yellow, Permanent Orange, Prussian Blue and Mineral Violet Deep, all from Batch 2 of Davidson's Pigments. My brushes are a Daler Rowney Aquafine 'Skyflow' 2 inch synthetic wash brush; an Escoda Ultimo synthetic mop brush size 10; a Mastertouch Aquamarine watercolour round brush, size 2; a Pro Arte Sword Liner, size Small; and a Daler Rowney Aquafine fan brush, size 2.{% endraw %}
