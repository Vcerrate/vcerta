{% raw %}Does autism present differently in women than men? Do you have autistic traits you’ve been explaining away since childhood? Why are women underdiagnosed?<br /><br />Learn how autistic women fly under the radar and what some of our “tells” are. We’ll explore appearance, intellect, emotions, learning styles and relationships. We’ll define camouflaging and masking and how this makes it harder for us to identify where we get stuck.<br /><br />I'm Tay. I'm a mom of 2 who received an unexpected autism diagnosis at age 31 and it's been a monumental journey!<br /><br />The road to an adult autism diagnosis can be challenging, but I’m here to help you by providing resources and information I’ve learned along the way. Obtaining a diagnosis can help you develop more self-compassion, lessen stress and anxiety, and discover effective coping strategies. <br /><br />Being autistic is nothing to be ashamed of. It’s a very intricate and unique way of seeing the world that has plenty of strengths and advantages. <br /><br />🟥🟧🟨 SUPPORT THE CHANNEL 🟩🟦🟪<br />1️⃣ If you have been positively impacted by the channel and would like to show your support, you can do so in the following ways 🤗<br /><br />🟢 Venmo: @TaylorHeaton<br />🔵 PayPal: paypal.me/MomOnTheSpectrum<br /><br />2️⃣ MELTDOWN SURVIVAL GUIDE ⭐️✨🤩💃💪<br />Name Your Price for my custom-created 11-page Meltdown Survival Guide to help you make it through the tough times.<br />👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://taylorheaton.gumroad.com/l/meltdownsurvivalguide">https://taylorheaton.gumroad.com/l/meltdownsurvivalguide</a><br /><br />👏🏻 FREE 👏🏻 WAYS TO SHOW YOUR SUPPORT 🦾<br />🟥 SUBSCRIBE to the channel<br />🟧 LIKE the videos that are helpful to you<br />🟨 COMMENT in the comment section<br />🟩 Click the “bell” to be notified when I release new videos<br /><br />🙏 Thank you immensely to those of you who have already donated, been active on the channel, and/or purchased the Meltdown Survival Guide! <br /># WhatDreamsAreMadeOf # IsThisMyLife<br /><br />I’d love to hear from you in the comments below.

In future videos I will make sure to address this issue when referencing any materials that use this term. If you are interested in learning more about the origins of this term, please be warned that you will be reading very upsetting information regarding TRIGGER WARNING child violence. I apologize for any upset or harm I may have caused by using these terms without knowing their origins.<br /><br /><br />#autism #autistic #femaleautism #adhd #mentalhealth{% endraw %}
