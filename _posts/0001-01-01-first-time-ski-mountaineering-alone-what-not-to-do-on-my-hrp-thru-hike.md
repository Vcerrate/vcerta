{% raw %}On my HRP thru hike last summer, I was forced to go around Pic Carlit because of bad weather. This vlog is my winter attempt to climb Pic Carlit - it did not go well. I don't recommend doing anything in the mountains alone, but I want to share my experience in the hope you can learn from it.<br /><br />TRAINING PROGRAMS:<br />$10 Beginners Program ►Elements: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Elements-Program">https://bit.ly/Elements-Program</a><br />Strength &amp; Mobility Program ►Hike Strong: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/hikestrong101">https://bit.ly/hikestrong101</a><br />Uphill fitness program  ►Uphill Endurance: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Uphill-endurance-BC">https://bit.ly/Uphill-endurance-BC</a><br />Knee Strength Program ►Mountain Proof Knees: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/MPK-program">https://bit.ly/MPK-program</a><br /><br /><br />SUPPORT<br />Buy a tee to support the channel ►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://basecampmerch.threadless.com/">https://basecampmerch.threadless.com/</a><br />Info on the Gear I Use ►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kit.co/ChaseMountains">https://kit.co/ChaseMountains</a> <br />Support the Channel on Patreon  ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/chasemountains">https://www.patreon.com/chasemountains</a><br /><br />CONNECT<br />Connect with me on Instagram ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/chase_mountains">https://www.instagram.com/chase_mountains</a><br />Visit my blog &amp; website ►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.basecamptraining.com.au">https://www.basecamptraining.com.au</a>{% endraw %}
