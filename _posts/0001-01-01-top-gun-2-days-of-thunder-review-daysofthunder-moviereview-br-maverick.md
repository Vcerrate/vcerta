{% raw %}#DaysOfThunder #MovieReview<br />Maverick is only a few weeks away (unless it gets delayed again) so I thought I would look back on another Tom Cruise classic, Days of Thunder. A film that basically reboots Top Gun and replaces the planes with race cars. Yet, I couldn't help but find Days of Thunder to be the better of the 2 films. The movie is a carbon copy in almost every way. Tony Scott implements the same beautiful, orange cinematography. Cruise once again plays a cock-sure  wild-card who can only be tamed by a beautiful blonde (Nicole Kidman). This film's Ice Man is Michael Rooker. There is even a deadly wreck that shakes up the main protagonist. There is no denying Top Gun 2 was already made, it was just called Days of Thunder.<br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmuP70--NYoqgyo3N0ZwDCA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmuP70--NYoqgyo3N0ZwDCA/join</a><br /><br />My Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/adamdoesmovies">https://www.patreon.com/adamdoesmovies</a><br /><br />My Social Media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/adamolinger">https://linktr.ee/adamolinger</a><br /><br />Narrated by: Adam Olinger<br />Edited by: Adam Olinger{% endraw %}
