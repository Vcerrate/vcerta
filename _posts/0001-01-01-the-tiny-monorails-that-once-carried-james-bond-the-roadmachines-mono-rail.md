{% raw %}The Roadmachines Mono-Rail may have been the only truly useful, fit-for-purpose monorail in the world. Of the hundreds that were built, most were never meant for passengers. But they did carry a couple of famous people in their time, including a certain secret agent...<br /><br />Thank you to the staff and volunteers at the Amberley Museum - Harry and Gerry in particular - for running the monorail specially, and letting me film! The Amberley Museum is a massive industrial heritage museum in the South Downs, and you can find out more about them here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amberleymuseum.co.uk/">https://www.amberleymuseum.co.uk/</a><br /><br />There are lots more videos of Amberley's rail vehicles at the volunteers' channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMHTdXU7cfBdNBzdVkgaIrQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMHTdXU7cfBdNBzdVkgaIrQ</a><br /><br />My research is heavily based on David Voice's &quot;Mono-Rail: The History of the Industrial Monorails Made By Road Machines Ltd., Metalair Ltd and Rail Machines Ltd&quot;, ISBN 1874422877, available from Adam Gordon Books: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ahgbooks.com/index.php/product/mono-rail/">http://www.ahgbooks.com/index.php/product/mono-rail/</a><br /><br />Thanks to Derry Faux-Nightingale for the initial idea!<br /><br />The Tanat Valley Railway in Nantmawr is the home for the Richard Morris collection, more than seventy surviving Roadmachines Mono-Rails: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tanatvalleyrailway.co.uk/monorail">https://www.tanatvalleyrailway.co.uk/monorail</a><br /><br />Also a helpful resource:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.irsociety.co.uk/Archives/16/Monorail.htm">https://www.irsociety.co.uk/Archives/16/Monorail.htm</a><br /><br />I'm at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tomscott.com">https://tomscott.com</a><br />on Twitter at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tomscott">https://twitter.com/tomscott</a><br />on Facebook at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/tomscott">https://facebook.com/tomscott</a><br />and on Instagram as tomscottgo{% endraw %}
