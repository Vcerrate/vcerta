Need to step closer to the edge.<br />One  step closer  <br /><br />I know I'm ready to fly<br />I'm breaking over, breaking over <br />cut these chains and rise<br />I'm taking control, taking control<br />Breaking myself away ( I'm breaking over, breaking over)<br />This is my way to say (I`m taking control, taking control)<br /><br />Why am I still here, I'm freezing.<br />Lips are turning blue, I'm shaking<br />Cold breath in the morning, inhaling the dust you keep feeding to me<br />Are this cage and chains just meant for me<br /> &quot;I will shout out loud, there's a way out&quot; <br />Is there anyone who can set me free <br />“I don't need to know how, this is the way out”<br /><br />It's getting harder to breathe. Lips are turning blue.<br />Inhale.<br />Try to inhale<br /><br />You need to take a deeper breath, get on your knees and stand up. <br />It ain't so hard  Keep moving. Break yourself free<br />(scream: you need to breathe, get on your knees)<br /><br />━━━━━━<br /><br />Tourdates<br /><br />09.02.2022: Rock Fabrik, Ubach Palenberg, Germany<br />10.02.2022: Z-7, Pratteln, Switzerland<br />11.02.2022: Rock Palast, Bochum, Germany<br />12.02.2022: Baroeg, Rotterdam, The Netherlands<br />13.02.2022: Belvedere, Namur, Belgium<br />14.02.2022: The Dome, London, UK<br />15.02.2022: La Boule Noire, Paris, France<br />16.02.2022: Rock and Eat, Lyon, France<br />18.02.2022: Hard Club, Porto, Portugal<br />19.02.2022: RCA Club, Lisboa, Portugal<br />20.02.2022: X Club, Seville, Spain<br />21.02.2022: Caracol, Madrid, Spain<br />22.02.2022: Bóvedo, Barcelona, Spain<br />24.02.2022: tba, Milano, Italy<br />25.02.2022: Backstage, München, Germany<br />26.02.2022: Café Central, Weinheim, Germany<br />27.02.2022: Randal Club, Bratislava, Slovakia<br />28.02.2022: tba, Berlin, Germany<br />-{% endraw %}
