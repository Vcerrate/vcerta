{% raw %}Update 8.10 has arrived in WoT Blitz! It'll be easier to complete Operations: The number of levels was decreased from 80 to 60, and a License that will help you receive rewards faster was introduced. The prices for Premium shells were adjusted. Their cost is directly related to the tank's tier, as well as to their penetration and damage.
