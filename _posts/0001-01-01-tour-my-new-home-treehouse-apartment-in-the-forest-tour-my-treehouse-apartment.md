{% raw %}Tour my Treehouse Apartment in the Forest - new empty home tour<br /><br />A huge apology for the poor camera quality during the walkthrough tour. I only had an old phone with me when I got the chance to film it empty! It is now filled with boxes that I need to sort üò¨ (also, a big thank you to the subscriber who sent me the animal head carving, I love it and sent you a card in the mail, I hope you recieve it soon!)<br /><br />The bottom of my house is not yet complete, renovations are still happening. However, I did manage to put together - at least - a little introduction to the new home. I am calling this house, presently, the tree house, as it gives me the feel of a little tree home my father built me when I was very young. I am really enjoying this new space, it is currently empty except for a couple furniture items and some boxes, but I hope to be further along in the moving process by next week. <br /><br />MY ETSY SHOP ü¶ä üçÑ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/thecottagefairyart">https://www.etsy.com/shop/thecottagefairyart</a> <br />Thank you for the support!
