{% raw %}Remember us talking on Instagram and Facebook about sharing all the videos of the Signature Haircuts DVD? The first up? The Executive Contour. This DVD was made in 2012 where we show our way of working on different chops. Some of you were not too happy about us wanting to share it online for free bc you already bought it. We understand. But you know, isn’t buying a CD from your favorite band and listening it online also the same thing? Thanks for understanding, we just want to spread more knowledge when it comes down to the craft we take pretty serious. <br /><br />-FOLLOW US-<br /><br />Want to know more about Schorem, our barber academy The Old School (www.theoldschoolbarberacademy.com) and it’s five courses (beginner &amp; advanced)?
