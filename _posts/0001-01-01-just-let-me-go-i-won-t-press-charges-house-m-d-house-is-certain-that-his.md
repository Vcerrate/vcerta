He decides to intervene and take matters into his own hands, but both the actor and House's team dismiss his assessment and do not believe there is anything wrong. Meanwhile, Wilson and Amber have their first argument and Cuddy tries to keep up appearances when an inspector makes an unexpected visit to Princeton-Plainsboro.<br /><br />Your favorite shows, movies and more are here.
