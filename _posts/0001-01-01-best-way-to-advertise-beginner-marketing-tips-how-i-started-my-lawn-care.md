As I was getting ready to graduate college with a 4-year bachelors degree in communication, I was faced with 2 options: either getting a boring 9-5 and joining the rat-race real world&quot;, or take matters into my own hands and try to build something up on my own! The closer I came to graduating, the more I realized I had to make something happen. On a whim, one day I posted an ad for basic lawn care work on Craigslist as I sat in the Vietnamese restaurant I was working in at the time. I got a call the next day, and that same day I quoted and landed my first job. I got paid $65 in 1.25 hours... and the lightbulb moment went off! From that moment, I went all in begin picking up as many customers as possible &amp; never looked back. As soon as I had 20~ customers I left that serving job, and for the past 5 year's I've been 100% self-employed via this lawn care business model and each year has only gotten better than the last. My only goal is to teach others how to use a simple, solo lawn care business model as their vehicle for achieving financial financial freedom- and that making $500/day with 3 tools &amp; a truck is very simple once you have proper systems in place &amp; quality weekly/biweekly recurring customers locked into your schedule! Work outdoors, be your own boss, and live a great life üå±<br /><br />üî•üå± ‚û°Ô∏è And it all started with just 3 tools &amp; a truck... <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.makemoneymowing.com/">https://www.makemoneymowing.com/</a> <br /><br />#lawncare #selfemployed #startyourbusiness{% endraw %}
