{% raw %}Fondly called Padma Shri Chaiwala, Mr Prakash Rao Ji dedicated his entire life to educating &amp; feeding the slum kids. Over the years, he has transformed thousands of lives with the power of education. A poor chaiwala, he saw poverty ruining the lives of slum kids around him. He took it upon himself to educate them. An initiative that began in the backyard of his small house led to the establishment of the Asha O Ashwasana school. Today, Prakash Rao Ji is no more but his daughter Bhanupriya wishes to continue his legacy, his good work. But to do that, she needs your help. Bhanupriya &amp; the poor kids of Asha O Ashwasana need your help to continue his good work! Please donate now to keep the school running: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3wnMoVG">https://bit.ly/3wnMoVG</a>{% endraw %}
