{% raw %}Today on the channel, I drive the rare supercharged version of the first generation Toyota MR2. Not available in Europe, this model was sold only to the US and Japanese markets. I've previously tested a Mk1 MR2 and enjoyed it, but didn't fall for it - this changes all that.<br /><br />#Toyota #MR2 #Supercharged<br /><br />Want to see your car on the channel?
