{% raw %}Russian forces have seized control of the Chernobyl power plant, 60 miles north of Kiev, after a 'fierce' battle with the condition of nuclear storage facilities 'unknown', officials in Kiev have said. Video revealed Russian tanks and armoured vehicles in front of the destroyed reactor, amid fears radiation could leak and shower Europe with fallout.
