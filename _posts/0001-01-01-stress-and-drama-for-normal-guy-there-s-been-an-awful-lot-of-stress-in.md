{% raw %}There's been an awful lot of stress in my life over the past few weeks.  First Meg, Ash and I caught covid.  That caused some interesting problems because Meg couldn't go to work, and our nanny couldn't help us with our son.  Then we decided to live out our dream and buy a new home!  We're moving!  While trying to figure that out with movers, mortgage, insurance, etc... The Howard caught on fire!  And then the next day the Ferrari California got in a wreck!  Holy cow, you'd think that would be enough stress but no, more bad things.  We were still dealing with the bureaucracy of trying to get our dealership license, and then we had to get our house ready to be sold!  Overall, it's just been absolutely nuts here.<br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfl49oZa0uJq_5ZpOb9drrQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfl49oZa0uJq_5ZpOb9drrQ/join</a><br /><br />Check out my website for parts, services, and merch! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.normalguysupercar.com">https://www.normalguysupercar.com</a><br />Use the code ngs10 and save 10% off most items!<br /><br />Email us sales@normalguysupercar.com for custom quotes.<br /><br />Memberships: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ngsmember">https://bit.ly/ngsmember</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fb.me/normalguysupercar">https://fb.me/normalguysupercar</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/normalguysupercar">https://www.instagram.com/normalguysupercar</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/normalguysuperc">https://twitter.com/normalguysuperc</a><br /><br />#Stress #Drama #Moving{% endraw %}
