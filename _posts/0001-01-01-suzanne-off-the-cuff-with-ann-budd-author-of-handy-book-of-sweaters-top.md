She worked as an editor for Interweave Press for more than 20 years and is now a freelance editor, teacher, and designer. Ann has authored more than a dozen knitting books, including the popular The Knitter’s Handy Book series, Getting Started Knitting Socks, Sock Knitting Master Class, New Directions in Sock Knitting, and many of Interweave’s Style series books. More recently, Ann began her own retreats, aptly called Knit For Fun Retreats, that take place three times a year in the U.S. and Canada. Ann lives in Boulder, Colorado, and teaches workshops across North America and beyond.
