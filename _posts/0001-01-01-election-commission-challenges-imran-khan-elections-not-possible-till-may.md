{% raw %}While Imran Khan and PTI are demanding resignation of Raja Sikander Sultan, Chief Election Commissioner, Election Commission has dropped a new bomb shell by claiming that Elections are not possible before May 2023. This is clearly politics by Chief Election Commissioner because he had previously taken a position in front of Supreme Court that Elections are not possible before Oct 2022. Now Raja Sikander says that new census must be held before delimitation in Aug 22, and it will take four months, then fresh delimitation will be needed and it will not complete till May 2023. If system is supporting this politics by Chief Election Commissioner then its obvious that Pakistan's ruling elite has not learnt any lessons from country's painful history. Pakistan faces insurgencies in two provinces, serious political polarisation due to the way Imran Khan govt was removed and an economic crisis that needs a strong government. Amidst this humongous political crisis the kind of games being played reflect a childish bureaucratic mindset without a national vision. Lets hope sanity prevails and the power elite realize that earliest Elections are the only practical solution.<br /><br />Moeed Pirzada, Editor Global Village Space, is a prominent TV Anchor and strategic Analyst.
