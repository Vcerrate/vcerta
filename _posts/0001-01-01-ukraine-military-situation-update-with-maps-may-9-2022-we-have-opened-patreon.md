No changes today or yesterday.<br />- Zaporizhya frontline - no changes today.<br />- Ukrainian army has lost control over Popasna<br />- Russian troops are squeezing line around Severodonetsk and attempting to establish bridgeheads near Bilogorivka and Pryvillya. Russian side has established bridgehead near Bilogorivka, but the pontoon bridge was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery which led to a loss of the bridgehead, as small Russian force was mopped by Ukrainian forces.<br /><br />1. Kharkiv: Ukrainian troops are slowly pushing Russian side out - they captured village of Lyptsi, Vesele. Russian is withdrawing its battle-worn troops from here to Russian territory.<br />2. Izyum bridgehead: No major Russian progress today. It is extremely dangerous penetration by Russian troops that potentially could lead to large pocket for Ukrainian troops west of Donetsk. <br />3. Lyman bridgehead. No changes today.<br />4. Popasna, Rubizhne and Severodonetsk. Russian troops captured all of Rubizhne. Russian mercenaries - Wagner Group operates in Popasna, also Russian 57 brigade operates there as well. Confirmed capture of Popasna by Russian troops.<br />5. West of Donetsk: Avidyivka and Maryinka. Avdiyivaka - never ending attempts of the Russian side to break-through there. Russian forces captured village called Troitske, attacking towards Novobakhmutivka.<br />6. Vugledar is in Ukrainian hands. <br />7. Velyka Novosilka - Gulyapole stretch of frontline. Ukrainian strongholds are towns of Gulyaypole and village of Velyka Novosilka. Russian 19D is operating there. Russian troops are consolidating their gains. Also, 42D has been spotted in the area. Russian troops caputred village Vremivka attached to Velyka Novosilka from west and separate by small river. The most northern group of Russian troops has been stopped before village of Vilne Pole. Ukranian side brought its 128 brigade and regiment Azov Kyiv to stop Russian advance there. No Russian progress here today.<br />8. No new attacks on Orikhiv.<br />9. Mariupol: opportunity to do a breakout attempt by the Ukrainian forces might have been lost as density of Russian troops increased due to smaller perimeter. Based on other sources, opportunity  to break out is still viable.<br />9. Mykolayiv: No major changes.{% endraw %}
