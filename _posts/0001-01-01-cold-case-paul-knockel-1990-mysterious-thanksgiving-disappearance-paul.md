The following day on November 13th one of his nephews noticed Paul's car parked on U.S. Route 151 near the 'Welcome to Wisconsin' sign just a mile from the Dubuque-Wisconsin Bridge. <br /><br />This family member didn't report seeing Paul at the time and didn't stop to check if he was in any trouble.<br /><br />Later that day the same family member reported the car wasn't parked there anymore.<br /><br />Paul never made it to Thanksgiving Dinner on November 26th and his family soon realized he had failed to turn up to a job at a Mail Order Warehouse in Monroe, Wisconsin. <br /><br />They traveled to his home at 2105 Washington Street and found no sign of Paul and his car was gone, but he had left behind his wallet, watch, and even his shoes.<br /><br />Family members then reported Paul missing to the Dubuque Police Department.<br /><br />INVESTIGATION<br />Police found the case a particularly difficult one to investigate.<br /><br />Paul hadn't had a social life outside of his family. <br /><br />He hadn't been in trouble with the law and wasn't known to abuse alcohol or drugs.<br /><br />Paul also hadn't been known to be depressed or suicidal and didn't usually travel anywhere but to see his family and to work.<br /><br />This made it difficult to ascertain what he could have been doing when he disappeared or even when he disappeared.<br /><br />Initially, police believed that whatever had happened to Paul occurred on or around November 13th when his vehicle, a maroon-colored 2-door 1981 Mercury Zephyr with license plate NBL923 went missing. <br /><br />The problem with this assertion was that a witness later came forward to say they saw Paul driving that car near his home on November 17th, suggesting everything was still normal at that time.<br /><br />Police could never find any evidence that Paul had been involved in organized crime, drugs, or any other illegal activity that might explain his sudden disappearance.<br /><br />Other then a search of the rivers and Woodlands near where Paul lived and where his car was seen parked on November 13th, police had little indication of where else to look for the 53-year-old. <br /><br />Our search did not uncover any evidence of Paul or his vehicle in the area. <br /><br />Hug the ones you love for you never know when it might be the last time you see them. <br /><br />As of the release of this documentary, because of your support: 19 Missing Person Cold Cases Have Been Solved since 2019, bringing resolution and answers to families looking for their lost loved ones.<br /><br />The AWP Movement would not be possible without your support, helping us travel the US offering our services for FREE to families searching for their lost loved ones.<br /><br />Donate to AWP and Help Further Our Efforts.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://adventureswithpurpose.com/products/make-a-donation">https://adventureswithpurpose.com/products/make-a-donation</a><br /><br />üé¨üçø Watch More of Our Recoveries<br /><br />SOLVED: Missing 23-years Underwater<br />(Samantha Hopper, 22-month-old Daughter Courtney, Unborn Baby)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/isqd8OOcJpQ">https://youtu.be/isqd8OOcJpQ</a><br /><br />SOLVED 84-Year-Old Missing Person Case..
