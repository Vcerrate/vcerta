{% raw %}We found a town that is completely gone now. They put in a huge dam project in this area of Hunan, so what you see in this video has not only never been documented, but doesn't even exist now. We hope you enjoy our travels through China, and decided to make some cozy videos about what we see, and feel, and our observations of the area, and translations of the signs etc. We will be heading north soon!<br /><br />One day, nationalists trolls called us &quot;2 Cheats hit the clown&quot;. Try as we might, we never figured out what it meant... So why not profit off of the hate! 2 Cheats Hit the Clown is BACK!!!
