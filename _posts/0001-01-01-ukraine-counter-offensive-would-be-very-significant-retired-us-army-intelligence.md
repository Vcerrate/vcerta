{% raw %}Retired US Army Intelligence Officer Chuck DeVore says a Ukrainian counter-offensive could occur north west of Kyiv. <br /><br />Mr DeVore said Ukraine has up to seven million personnel fit for military service and pointed to their “high morale.” <br /><br />“We’re likely to see a very significant Ukrainian counter-offensive north west of Kyiv, in that very marshy and wooded terrain that is very ideal for the use of dismounted infantry,” he told Sky News Australia.{% endraw %}
