They are all great thinkers seeking our deepest connection with the universe and where we fit in with everything. Ervin Laszlo explores where we come from, with an understanding that our universe is not just holographic, but holotropic – which means, moving toward wholeness. As we collectively come into awareness that everything in the universe acts as one and that nothing is ever truly disconnected, we stand at the cusp of an evolutionary leap in consciousness.<br /><br />About Gaia:<br />Gaia offers the largest resource of consciousness expanding videos.
