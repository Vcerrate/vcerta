{% raw %}NOTE: THIS IS NOT CONFIRMED YET (JANUARY 19 2022), NOR HAS A TIME FRAME BEEN GIVEN.  But it is highly assumed that, thanks to a tweet by community manager DMG, gunsmith materials will be removed from the game at some point in the near future, most likely Witch Queen, but who knows for certain.  As a result, you will likely have thousands of Gunsmith Materials to purge (or not purge because who cares).  So while you're purging, might as well take a look at some rolls to see if they're worth keeping around.<br /><br />Introduction - 0:00<br />Night Watch - 2:18<br />Whispering Slab - 2:48<br />Eternal Blazon - 3:08<br />Contingency Plan - 3:25<br />Gnawing Hunger - 3:41<br />Stochastic Variable - 4:07<br />Last Perdition - 4:43<br />Legal Action II - 4:56<br />Scathelocke - 5:09<br />Dire Promise - 5:19<br />Annual Skate - 5:31<br />Warmind Cell Weapons - 5:51<br />Ikelos Sniper - 6:25<br />Distant Tumulus - 6:42<br />First In, Last Out - 6:52<br />Truthteller - 7:13<br />Cartesian Coordinate - 7:39<br />Main Ingredient - 8:17<br />Falling Guillotine - 8:59<br />Class Swords - 9:14<br />Tarantula - 9:40<br /><br />True Prophecy - People still like Timed Payload on this thing, so go nuts, Explosive Payload also good, first perk I'd probably do Overflow or Rangefinder.<br /><br />5% discount on ASTRO gear: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.astro.family/DATTO">http://www.astro.family/DATTO</a> (works in all available regions)<br /><br />Save $50 dollars when you buy a pre-built PC from Evolve PCs when you use code DATTO at checkout: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.evolvepcs.gg">https://www.evolvepcs.gg</a><br /><br />Epic Games Store Creator Code: HelloDatto<br /><br />Danielle's Advanced.GG code: TRVL at checkout (Datto has no affiliation with advanced.gg)<br /><br />Need a good chair?
