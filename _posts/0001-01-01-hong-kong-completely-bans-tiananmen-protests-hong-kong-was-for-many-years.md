{% raw %}Hong Kong was for many years the only place in &quot;China&quot; where the Tiananmen Square Massacre was commemorated every year. That's no longer the case after Hong Kong passed the national security law that would allow people charged with crimes to be extradited to the mainland for prosecution. In this episode of China Uncensored, we look at what happened during the Tiananmen protests 33 years ago, how the Hong Kong government has banned protests, and what has happened to people who tried to organize commemorative vigils. <br /><br />YouTube demonetizes our channels, we need your support!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/ChinaUncensored">https://www.patreon.com/ChinaUncensored</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chinauncensored.locals.com">https://chinauncensored.locals.com</a><br /><br />We also accept bitcoin!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chinauncensored.tv/bitcoin">https://chinauncensored.tv/bitcoin</a><br /><br />Buy our merchandise!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chinauncensored.tv/merchandise">https://chinauncensored.tv/merchandise</a><br /><br />Make sure to share this video with your friends!<br />______________________________<br />Subscribe for updates:<br />youtube.com/ChinaUncensored?sub_confirmation=1<br /><br />______________________________<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ChinaUncensored">https://twitter.com/ChinaUncensored</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/ChinaUncensored">https://facebook.com/ChinaUncensored</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/ChinaUncensored">https://instagram.com/ChinaUncensored</a><br /><br />And check out the China Unscripted podcast!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/chinaunscripted">https://youtube.com/chinaunscripted</a><br /><br />#China<br />______________________________<br />Â© All Rights Reserved.{% endraw %}
