{% raw %}In today’s podcast I am joined by my great friends, Benjamin and Azrya Bequer- Co-Founding Stewards of BEQOMING. We delve into the contents of their new book, BEQOMING: Everything You Didn’t Know You Wanted. This episode focused on the intricacies of relationship, and specifically how Benjamin and Azrya deepened their union at quantum speed. We explored the available tools for deepening bonds, the relationship between safety and freedom, and how fear is our ultimate ally. This powerful quote kicked off the podcast and was woven into the entirety of this conversation; “We are alive only to the degree of which we are willing to be annihilated”.<br /><br />Check out Benjamin and Azrya Bequer's new book BEQOMING: Everything You Didn’t Know You Wanted.
