{% raw %}God Bless America: How the US is Obsessed with Religion | Investigative Documentary From 2019<br /><br />Despite being an officially secular country, religion is everywhere in the United States. 70% of Americans are Christians and the majority of them voted for Trump. Evangelicals mobilized in their masses to get Donald Trump elected and they similarly geared up to do the same in the most recent election. Evangelicals have even created their own Bible-themed attractions, boldly rewriting the science books to educate their children. In Kentucky, an actual-size Noah’s ark has been built along with a museum that supports the theory that the universe was created in just six days. In this documentary, we dive into the religious world inside the United States. <br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br /><br />Subscribe ENDEVR for free: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3e9YRRG">https://bit.ly/3e9YRRG</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG">https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/endevrdocs/">https://www.instagram.com/endevrdocs/</a><br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />#FreeDocumentary #ENDEVR #GodBlessAmerica<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br /><br />ENDEVR explains the world we live in through high-class documentaries, special investigations, explainers videos and animations.
