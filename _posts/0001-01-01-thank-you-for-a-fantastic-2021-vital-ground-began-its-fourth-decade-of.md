{% raw %}Vital Ground began its fourth decade of conservation work with tremendous success in 2021. Our supporters and partners enabled the organization to complete more habitat protection projects across the Northern Rockies than we have in any year before. We also teamed up with a record 15 partners on crucial coexistence projects helping wildlife and people share the landscape safely. Finally, your support helped us bid farewell to a beloved ambassador and further cement his conservation legacy.{% endraw %}
