In this video, we are going to discuss the process of globalization on global and regional scales. Today, here in Tyumen, we are beginning a series of lectures on the Conception of Social Safety. Why the Conception of Social Safety, but not National Safety&quot;.<br /><br />Russian General Petrov on Global Mafia and their Methods of Manipulation (Lecture 1):<br />&quot;Russia and moreover - the population of our planet, consists of many nationalities. So, in our opinion, it is more correct to raise a question on the Conception of Social Safety, so that all the people on Earth live peacefully and happily&quot;. <br /><br />Russian General Petrov on Global Mafia and their Methods of Manipulation (Lecture 1):<br />&quot;The first ones who consciously came to an understanding of this issue were the ancient Egyptian Zhretses.

Wielding secret knowledge, which belonged only to them and which they hid from the masses, enabled them to manipulate the consciousness of all people, from illiterate mobs to pharaohs themselves, which is properly shown by Boleslaw Prus in his novel “Pharaoh”. By the way, it is also a film. The film shows how Zhretses manipulated the Pharaoh and killed him in the end by possessing secret knowledge of the solar eclipse&quot;.<br /><br />Russian General Petrov on Global Mafia and their Methods of Manipulation (Lecture 1):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/xCj_hU6xAxw">https://youtu.be/xCj_hU6xAxw</a><br /><br />You can find more lectures by Petrov here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtH7t4KO6uGit_EgB9h2aYMlDIO0TZgEK">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtH7t4KO6uGit_EgB9h2aYMlDIO0TZgEK</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Russian-View-104856751025830">https://www.facebook.com/Russian-View-104856751025830</a><br /><br />#russiangeneral #crisis #politics{% endraw %}
