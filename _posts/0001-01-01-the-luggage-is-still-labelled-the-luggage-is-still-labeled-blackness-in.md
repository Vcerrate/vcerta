{% raw %}The Luggage is Still Labeled: Blackness in South African Art. Co-produced by Vuyile Voyiya and Julie McGee. <br /><br />Author: Vuyile C Voyiya; Julie L McGee.<br />Editor: Stephen Gogolak.<br />Music composition: Titus Abbott and Frank X. Mauceri.<br /><br />For South African artists of color the demise of apartheid did not radically change access or attitudes. Separateness and difference still divide the contemporary art world into black and white. Black artists are beginning to take on some of these issues - - access, recognition, education. Despite initiatives such as Vakalisa (&quot;Awake&quot;), the Community Arts Project, or BLAC art project, South African artists of color are still disadvantaged. Formal art education, which was not available to artists of color in the apartheid days, remains an elitist enterprise with little collegial support. Michaelis School of Art in Cape Town has not yet shaken off its institutional racism in terms of student intake, faculty recruitment, or Eurocentric curriculum. Art criticism is similarly biased against artists of color. Old paradigms persist, e.g., &quot;township art&quot; or &quot;black art.&quot; Artists are still pigeon-holed. Freedom of artistic expression has not really arrived. Where are the black art critics?<br /><br />The South African National Gallery (SANG), formidable, unwelcoming, admits to huge gaps in its collections. Artists of color perceive SANG as another white bastion not yet breached. They feel that SANG is not interested in them and their work.<br /><br /><br />To explore these issues of race and access the filmmakers conducted interviews with several South African artists and players on the art scene. Among those on camera are: Peter E. Clarke<br />Garth Erasmus<br />Thembinkosi Goniwe<br />Zayd Minty<br />Gavin Younge<br />David Koloane<br />Mgcineni Sobopha<br />Berni Searle<br />Lallitha Jawahirilal<br />Gabisile Ngcobo<br />Moshekwa Langa<br />Graham Faulken<br />Lionel Davis<br />Marilyn Martin<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/luggage-is-still-labeled-blackness-in-south-african-art/oclc/52761698">https://www.worldcat.org/title/luggage-is-still-labeled-blackness-in-south-african-art/oclc/52761698</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sil.si.edu/SILPublications/ModernAfricanArt/maadetail.cfm?subCategory=South%20Africa">https://www.sil.si.edu/SILPublications/ModernAfricanArt/maadetail.cfm?subCategory=South%20Africa</a>{% endraw %}
