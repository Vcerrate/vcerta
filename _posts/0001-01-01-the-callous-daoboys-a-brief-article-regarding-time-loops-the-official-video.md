Ignore! <br />(Spread across the floor, you fucked up the floor) <br />In your moral panic with a thousand doors, <br />How a cycle treats you, <br />Like you’re a cold sore <br />(Just give me the case, she’ll at least have life) <br /> <br />(You must’ve suffered) <br />Pagans mocking <br />(You must be tired) <br />biography  <br />(You can lay your head) <br />Written with lightning <br />(Put it on the tracks, pray the train’s your friend) <br /> <br />(You must’ve suffered) <br />In a murder of rainbows <br />(You must’ve suffered) <br />You’re the only crow <br />(You must’ve suffered) <br />Just sit back <br />(Over and over, over and over) <br /> <br />(Everyone remembers there first experience with deja-vu. For her it was her 1st grade art teacher saying “these shouldn’t look like octopuses” to the class while they were painting trees.) <br /> <br />(“You said that in my dream!” she exclaimed. Believing her experience to be nothing but a subconscious escapade) <br /> <br />(She then realized her response was also part of the “dream”. 30 years later, she felt this way 800 times over. Like she had been here before, repeating the same actions day in and day out) <br /> <br />Shatter everything, sever all your ties, <br />Give the sand a new home inside your cavities, <br />Obey the homily, jerk off in your car, <br />Kick up pollen while you drive back to the living quarters <br /> <br />Stand and watch, <br />This is what you did with the one life you had <br />You ruined it <br />I want to earn this moment <br />I want to work my way back <br />I want to earn this moment <br />I want to work my way back, <br />I want to start over, <br />I want to start over, <br />I want to start over, <br />I want to start over <br /> <br />The angels are all the same <br />The owls are not what they seem <br /> <br />(Start over) <br /> <br />#thecallousdaoboys #abriefarticleregardingtimeloops #mathcore<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vevo.ly/oeuRGr">http://vevo.ly/oeuRGr</a>{% endraw %}
