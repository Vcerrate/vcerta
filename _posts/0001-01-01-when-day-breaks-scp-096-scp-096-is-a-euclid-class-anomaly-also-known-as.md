{% raw %}SCP 096 is a Euclid Class anomaly also known as The Shy Guy.<br /><br />SCP-096 is a humanoid creature measuring approximately 2.38 meters in height. Subject shows very little muscle mass, with preliminary analysis of body mass suggesting mild malnutrition.<br />SCP096's jaw can open to four (4) times the norm of an average human.<br />SCP096 is normally extremely docile, with pressure sensors inside its cell indicating it spends most of the day pacing by the eastern wall. However, when someone views SCP-096's face, whether it be directly, via video recording, or even a photograph, it will enter a stage of considerable emotional distress. SCP-096 will cover its face with its hands and begin screaming, crying, and babbling incoherently. Approximately one (1) to two (2) minutes after the first viewing, SCP-096 will begin running to the person who viewed its face (who will from this point on be referred to as SCP-096-1).<br /><br />LIKE &amp; SUBSCRIBE to SCP Explained - Story &amp; Animation<br /><br />Watch these other SCP videos we love:<br /><br />SCP-096 - The Shy Guy (SCP Animation)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcNiHBvMWM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcNiHBvMWM</a><br /><br />SCP-096 - Look at a Picture of Shy Guy in Space?
