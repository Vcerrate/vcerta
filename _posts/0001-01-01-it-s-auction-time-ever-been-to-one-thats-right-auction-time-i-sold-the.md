{% raw %}Thats right, auction time. I sold the haybine, didnt quite get what we wanted for it but the barn space more than makes up for the price. Going to another one Friday morning. Its going to be a pretty good sale. If you like these kind of videos, let me know. As far as im concerned, there's farm equipment involved so its farming to me. Thanks for watching everyone{% endraw %}
