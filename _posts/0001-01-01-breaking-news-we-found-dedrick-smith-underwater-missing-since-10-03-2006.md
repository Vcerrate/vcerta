{% raw %}April 01, 2022, AWP began our search for 26-year-old Dedrick Smith who was last seen in Winston-Salem, North Carolina on October 3, 2006, and by late afternoon, the Adventures With Purpose team located Dedrick's car in just 14' of water.<br /><br /><br /><br />The next morning, April 2nd, AWP working alongside local law enforcement, Dedrick's car containing human remains, was recovered.<br /><br /><br /><br />Dedrick was last seen at his girlfriend's home when she went out in the middle of the night to get food, and when she returned he was gone. <br /><br /><br /><br />He changed his shirt and left his girlfriend's house on Booker Street, driving his bright blue/turquoise 1993 Pontiac Grand Am with the North Carolina license plate number NYB3645, which had never been spotted again, until today, April 1st, 2022. (This is not an April Fools Joke)<br /><br /><br /><br />There were reported sightings of him in the local area after his disappearance, but none of these were confirmed. His vehicle, which contained several extra changes of clothes, was never located.<br /><br /><br /><br />Smith maintained daily contact with his loved ones prior to his disappearance, and he had promised his mother he'd visit her house on October 4, but none of his family and friends have heard from him since he went missing.<br /><br /><br /><br />At this moment we want to take a moment to express our sympathies to Dedrick's family as they navigate this tragic outcome to a nightmare that has lasted 15 years. <br /><br /><br /><br />We are honored to be in this position to help families and it is because of you, our supporters, that this is possible. <br /><br /><br /><br />Take the time today to hug your loved ones a little tighter and cherish the moments you have. <br /><br /><br /><br />An edited episode of our searching for Dedrick and this case will be released in a few weeks as well as our podcast investigation episode. <br /><br /><br /><br />A full autopsy will need to be conducted before confirmation can be made that Dedrick has been brought home. <br /><br /><br /><br />The AWP Movement would not be possible without your support, helping us travel the US and offering our services for FREE to families searching for their lost loved ones...
