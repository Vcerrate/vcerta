{% raw %}Have you ever wondered what takes place after your application for a tenure-track position has been sent in? Are search committees at research institutions looking for the same things as teaching focused institutions? <br /><br />In this webinar, hosted by the ASBMB's Education and Professional Development Committee, panelists discussed what it’s like to be on both sides of the hiring process. They explain the ‘W’s of applying for a job — what you need to get an interview, what the search committee looks for in your application, and what makes your applications stand out.<br /><br />Panelists:<br />-Nathan Vanderford, University of Kentucky (Twitter: @nlvanderford)<br />-Rich Singiser, Clayton State University (Twitter: @DrRichSingiser)<br />-Dorothy Lerit, Emory University (Twitter: @LabLerit){% endraw %}
