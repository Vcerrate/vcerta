{% raw %}Hello friends, You are currently watching our original sleeping music video for toddlers - 3 Sleepy Owls &amp; Lullaby for Babies to go to Sleep 10 Hours dark screen # 22 with my song: &quot;Fairytale Dream&quot; by Greg S.<br /><br />This video has a darker screen after 3 hours so that you don't have to dim the screen of your device. <br /><br />ðŸ¦‰ How owls sleep? ðŸ™‚<br />Just turn on this animation and you can put the baby to bed and for 10 hours you will see the owl falling asleep and sleeping, and even 3 owls - the whole owl family in the forest at night. A lullaby that plays for the entire duration of the video also will help you fall asleep faster.<br /><br />We hope that every child and not only, will enjoy watching this video and will fall asleep quickly.<br /><br />The music I created especially for this lullaby sleep music video is tailored so as not to distract you too much from watching and relaxing or falling asleep.<br /><br />Subscribe to this channel â–º  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH-GlQNRjjdizKr57o-7oaA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH-GlQNRjjdizKr57o-7oaA?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Have beautiful relaxation and dreams, my dear friends.<br />Gregory S.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Listen to this song on my Soundcloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/user-717431308/fairytale-dream">https://soundcloud.com/user-717431308/fairytale-dream</a><br /><br />Our Facebook with lullaby songs â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/uploadre79/">https://www.facebook.com/uploadre79/</a><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Recommended playlists with baby lullaby songs go to sleep from Relaxing Lullabies &amp; Sleep Music<br /><br />Sleep music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmg6jiUGAZk&amp;list=PL6H9z5b8jE7Ve25fNP7KPnWQlymkk15Mn">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmg6jiUGAZk&amp;list=PL6H9z5b8jE7Ve25fNP7KPnWQlymkk15Mn</a><br />Relax music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6H9z5b8jE7VRCM1eLCvPz7GESK5JTw7Q">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6H9z5b8jE7VRCM1eLCvPz7GESK5JTw7Q</a><br /><br />Our the best lullaby ever (it works for many babies): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/CBoBxMrM2gQ">https://youtu.be/CBoBxMrM2gQ</a><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Song: &quot;Fairytale Dream&quot; by Greg S<br />Music: Greg S<br />Production: AVM - Relaxing Lullabies &amp; Sleep Music<br /><br /><br />I am a composer and producer. <br />All songs on this channel are mine or my team's.<br />I have all rights to them myself.<br />Please contact me first before you want to copy them.<br />Greg S.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />#3_sleeping_owls #lullaby_for_babies_to_go_to_sleep #bedtime #sleepy_time #3_sleepy_owls <br /><br /><br /><br />Â© 2022 Relaxing Lullabies &amp; Sleep Music by Greg S.<br />All rights reserved.
