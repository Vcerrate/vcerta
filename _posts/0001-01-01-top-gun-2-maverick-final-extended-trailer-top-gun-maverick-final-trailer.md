When he finds himself training a detachment of TOPGUN graduates for a specialized mission the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen, Maverick encounters Lt. Bradley Bradshaw (Miles Teller), call sign: “Rooster,” the son of Maverick’s late friend and Radar Intercept Officer Lt. Nick Bradshaw, aka “Goose.”<br />Facing an uncertain future and confronting the ghosts of his past, Maverick is drawn into a confrontation with his own deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who will be chosen to fly it. <br /> <br />STARRING Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Glen Powell, Lewis Pullman, Charles Parnell, Bashir Salahuddin, Monica Barbaro, Jay Ellis, Danny Ramirez, Greg Tarzan Davis with Ed Harris and Val Kilmer<br />DIRECTED BY Joseph Kosinski <br />SCREENPLAY BY Ehren Kruger and Eric Warren Singer and Christopher McQuarrie<br />STORY BY Peter Craig and Justin Marks<br />BASED ON CHARACTERS CREATED BY Jim Cash &amp; Jack Epps, Jr.<br />PRODUCED BY Jerry Bruckheimer, Tom Cruise, Christopher McQuarrie, David Ellison<br />EXECUTIVE PRODUCED BY Tommy Harper, Dana Goldberg, Don Granger, Chad Oman, Mike Stenson<br /><br /><br />Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Glen Powell, Lewis Pullman, Charles Parnell, Bashir Salahuddin, Monica Barbaro, Jay Ellis, Danny Ramirez, Greg Tarzan Davis with Ed Harris and Val Kilmer{% endraw %}
