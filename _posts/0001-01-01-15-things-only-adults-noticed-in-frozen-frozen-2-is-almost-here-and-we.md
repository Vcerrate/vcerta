{% raw %}Frozen 2 Is Almost Here And We're Expecting A Lot From Disney<br />Subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant</a><br /><br />El Video Que Debes Ver Antes De Frozen 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/NccgpfNKAxw">https://youtu.be/NccgpfNKAxw</a><br /><br />Howdy ScreenRanters! We have a treat for you today. You’re welcome! We’re going to take a look a gander at the singing, Icey themed, animated epic that is Frozen. With the sequel coming out soon, we wanted to take a look at the first film, once more. Only this time, we’re going to let you know about all the details that only made sense to the adults among us. So, if you’re a child, some of these entries today may have escaped your attention. Then again, the same may be true if you’re an adult! But that’s what we’re here for, to enlighten the minds of all.<br />Frozen is a family friendly film (alliteration). However, they slipped in many adult references to entertain the older generation, as they sat through the film for the 22nd time. Some entries refer to the themes of the plot, some refer to specific sentences and moments. You can expect to learn about Olaf’s acceptance of his snowman related dark fate. Elsa’s lack of a romance story and why that matters. Anna and Kristoff chatting about shoe size. Why King Agnarr and Queen Iduna are terrible parents. The odd parental behaviour of the magic Trolls. Who is Oaken’s family! As well as many, many innuendos scattered through Arendelle. Disney’s animated epic placed in a number of these fun references. So, watch the video to find out what they are!<br /><br />Our Social Media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/screenrant">https://twitter.com/screenrant</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant">https://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant</a><br /><br />Our Website<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://screenrant.com/">http://screenrant.com/</a>{% endraw %}
