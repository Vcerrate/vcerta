{% raw %}DOWNLOAD FORMERLY KNOWN- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/wcke2">http://goo.gl/wcke2</a><br /><br />&quot;Everybody wants to be heard. Everybody wants to be seen. Everybody wants to be known, and everybody's got some dreams.&quot;<br /><br />At first glance, the title &quot;Formerly Known&quot; will strike a chord with anyone who has been following Andy Mineo's music. Those who know about the name change from c-lite to Andy Mineo will get it, but that's not the only reason the mysterious title.<br /><br />Each of us long to be understood, loved, known. Most of us spend a majority of our life pursuing people, places, and things that we believe can offer this kind of comfort. Andy's hope is that this project will point people to the answer to those longings. We were made to have fellowship with the God that created us and knows us better than we know ourselves. The God that knew us before we were formed in our mothers womb. The God that knows every hair on our head. The God that makes us a new creation.<br /><br />&quot;I share quite a bit about my past on this project. Much of the album is testimonial. Prior to coming to faith in Jesus, I was an enemy of God. I was my own king, I lived life opposing the loving commands God has given us. I was what the bible describes as &quot;a child of wrath&quot; - but through Christ saving work on the Cross, that is only what I am formerly known as. Now, I am a child of light, a friend of God. My prayer is that many would come to know this God that makes all things new.&quot;- Andy Mineo<br /><br />www.twitter.com/andymineo<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/iamandymineo">http://www.facebook.com/iamandymineo</a>{% endraw %}
