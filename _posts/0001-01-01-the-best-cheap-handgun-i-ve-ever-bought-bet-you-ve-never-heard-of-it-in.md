{% raw %}In this episode of TFBTV, James Reeves talks about the best handgun he's ever bought for under $200. James has reviewed guns from BUL Armory in the past, so he was surprised to find a gun called the &quot;BUL Impact&quot; - also known as the &quot;Charles Daly DDA&quot; - for just $179 in surplus condition. This cheap pistol was too much for James to resist, so he bought it and tested it for months before making this review. Is this the best handgun James has ever purchased for under $200?
