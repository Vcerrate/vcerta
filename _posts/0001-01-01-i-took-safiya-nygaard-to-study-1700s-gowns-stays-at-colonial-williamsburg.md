When we were making plans for the Williamsburg trip, I knew I wanted to get Safiya into collections and show her some actual 18th-century gowns, stays, and even a particular waistcoat. I feel so lucky that Neal Hurst, Associate Curator of Costumes &amp; Textiles, and the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation were open and accomodating for us to film the experience! <br /><br />The center front closing black silk satin pleated back gown with colorful trim and embroidery has been one of my favorite gowns of all time, for a very very long time. I remember opening it up in a drawer and getting emotional when I was a wee intern baby at Colonial Williamsburg a hundred billion years ago. It's so unusual with its black satin &amp; rainbow trim...definitely made for a woman who had a lot of personality and knew what she wanted in a gown. It also made me think of Safiya, with her personal style and aesthetic. <br /><br />Same for the waistcoat...it has always made me laugh with how beautiful and grotesque it is...the ultimate power suit...if you will. ü§£And who doesn't love some good corsetry content (i know the youtube algorithm sure does...) so we also looked at some great examples of stays (what the 18th century called corsets) too! <br /><br />Anyways, if you would like to see more of this visit and support my channel, check out my Youtube Membership (click the Join button that's next to the subscribe button) or head on over to my patreon!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/abbycox">https://www.patreon.com/abbycox</a><br /><br />ü•≥Socials<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abbycoxcreates.com">https://www.abbycoxcreates.com</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/iamabbycox">https://www.instagram.com/iamabbycox</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/abbycox">https://www.patreon.com/abbycox</a><br />Tiktok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@iamabbycox">https://www.tiktok.com/@iamabbycox</a><br /><br />üìöMy books:<br />The American Duchess Guide to 18th-Century Dressmaking: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2GrkAIQ">https://amzn.to/2GrkAIQ</a><br /><br />The American Duchess Guide to 18th-Century Beauty: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2TTwJtq">https://amzn.to/2TTwJtq</a><br /><br />üíåBusiness Inquiries *ONLY* abbycox@semaphorebrands.com<br />(This email goes directly to my management and not to me.)<br /><br />üì™ Abby Cox<br />642 N.
