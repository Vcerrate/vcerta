Chet was there as the concept of the OODA Loop was being developed and constructed the first graphics of the OODA Loop from sketches Boyd drew. Chet is the author of the widely read business book “Certain to Win” which was the first book to describe Boyd’s strategy in terms familiar to business leaders and show how the OODA Loop and associated Boyd concepts apply to today’s business problems.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Certain-Win-Strategy-Applied-Business/dp/1413453767">https://www.amazon.com/Certain-Win-Strategy-Applied-Business/dp/1413453767</a><br /><br />Questions for Chet:<br />1) What are similarities and differences between business and military? How do you apply ideas from military field to business?<br />2) What are the characteristics of Toyota Production System? How are those ideas related to John Boyd's ideas?<br />3) Why is Agility the fundamental secret of the universe?<br />4) What topics from Certain to Win would you like to talk about today that we did not get to talk about last time?<br />5) What are the pitfalls you have seen in people trying to apply OODA loop?<br />6) What advice do you have for people who want to study John Boyd's ideas in depth? Where should they start and how should they proceed?<br />7) How does OODA loop apply to cooperation as opposed to competition?<br /><br />Please watch previous presentations on John Boyd and OODA loop by Chet Richards and Chuck Spinney to prepare for this great Meetup here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqpF1l8gdXlF4avTh71b868UPENKqmqhS">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqpF1l8gdXlF4avTh71b868UPENKqmqhS</a><br /><br />Don't Miss It!<br /><br />See the calendar at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.meetup.com/52LivingIdeas/events/calendar/">https://www.meetup.com/52LivingIdeas/events/calendar/</a><br />A Meetup Every Day, Every Week, For Everyone!<br />Every Weekday at 9pm ET; On Weekends at 2:30pm ET<br /><br />We record all our Meetups and post them on YouTube.
