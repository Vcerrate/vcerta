{% raw %}Ontario's first Active Gaming facility is opening in the fall in Burlington, Ontario at the Rio-Can Millcroft Shopping Centre. Activate is a fully Canadian company based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Our original location is the highest rated entertainment facility in the province with 5/5 stars on all review platforms. In addition, we are rated the #1 &quot;fun&quot; thing to do in the city. <br /><br />Our new COVID-19 cleaning procedures ensure the highest level of safety for our customers. Our process ensures that every use of our game rooms are completely cleaned prior to every use. We use a ULV fogger with a natural electrolysed solution and have frequent hand sanitizing stations throughout the facility. <br /><br />What is Activate?<br /><br />Active gaming is just like a video game, where you need to get your avatar from point A to point B. Except this time YOU are the player and point B is a specific achievement. Games will require you to jump, crawl, run, and hide or risk losing a life. Every game is timed and scores are allotted based on how fast you can complete each level.<br /><br />Activate offers a unique set of physically interactive games with over 200 levels that need to be beat in order to earn stars and get high scores. All players create a profile and are given an RFID wristband inside the facility, which records their progress. Playersâ€™ scores are available online, in addition to stars, badges, and leaderboards.{% endraw %}
