{% raw %}The goods and services that soils provide are essential to our local and global communities. Less understood are the tiny organisms supporting these massive benefits to society: soil microbes. The soil microbiome is a fundamental aspect of soil health, and both researchers and Ontario farmers are adapting their practices to study and support a healthy soil microbiome. Featuring University of Guelph microbiologist Dr. Kari Dunfield, graduate student Sarah Fournier, and Ontario Soil Network farmer Thomas Farrell.<br /><br />Research funding is provided by Canada Research Chairs, NSERC Discovery Grant, NSERC Collaborative Research and Development grant, Grain Farmers of Ontario, OMAFRA, Ontario-Quebec Partnership funding, and CFREF-Food From Thought.<br /><br />Ridgetown Campus is one of 15 Research Stations owned by the Agricultural Research Institute of Ontario and managed by the University of Guelph through the Ontario Agri-Food Innovation Alliance, a collaboration between the Ontario Government and the University of Guelph.{% endraw %}
