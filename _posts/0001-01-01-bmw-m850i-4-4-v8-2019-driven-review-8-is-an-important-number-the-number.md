{% raw %}The number eight is important for many reasons. Some cultures consider it a number representing luck and prosperity, to some, it symbolises harmony and balance and to BMW it represents a very important group of models. Well over 20-years ago BMW shocked the world with its grand touring sports car, the original 8-Series and subsequently, we have seen models such as the Z8 and more recent i8 electric roadster appear. Now 2019, and BMW is ready to shock the automotive world again, with the all-new essence of dynamic sporting luxury, the M850i.<br /><br />Presence<br /><br />They say an image says a thousand words, a statement that certainly holds true with the all-new 8-Series BMW. Literally, anyone you drive it turns heads and garners many on-lookers. A muscular front-end flanked by large air dampers, even larger BMW trademark kidney grills and the brand's iconic double-bubble style roof all help add to the 8-Series grand presence.<br /><br />From both the side and rear profile, the 8-Series is comprised of graceful and purposeful lines, which all culminate in what is a very beautiful blend of a sporting GT with saloon style stature.<br /><br />Luxury Meets Power<br /><br />Less is more can help describe how the 8-Series approaches luxury. The cabin is a delicate sophisticated blend of materials, all resulting in a cabin space which is svelte and sophisticated without being over cluttered. Taking centre stage within the dashboard is BMW's advanced Connected Drive Services 7.0 multimedia interface. <br /><br />The likes of full voice control is available as well as a platoon of modern connected services which assist in making the drive more connected and creating an office on the go environment when driving the vehicle. The digital dashboard represents a clean, almost aircraft cabin inspired design as we have started seeing present throughout much of the modern BMW line-up.<br /><br />Cosseting premium seats, a leather-wrapped dashboard and suede roof-lining all help make for a very comfortable place, perfect for long journeys. The M850i, however, is not just about long journeys, it also is about sporting bursts. <br /><br />With a whopping 4.4-Litre TwinPower Turbo V8, the vehicle produces a very, very healthy 390 kW and 750 Nm of torque. The result is a big bruiser, which is nimble on its toes if commanded and 0 - 100 km/h being dealt with in a mere 3.7 seconds.<br />A smooth shifting 8-speed transmission and xDrive all-wheel steering all assist in making the 8-Series a rapid response and comfortable grand tourer.    <br /><br />To Conclude<br /><br />The M850i brings with a level of luxury, elegance and sporting dynamism which is very difficult to match within the grand touring space. With a helping of BMW 7-Series stately stature beautifully combined into some of BMW's M DNA, the luxury GT represents a symbiosis of athleticism and luxury and finds the balance to excel at both these two elements.<br /><br />Full written review and SA pricing available at:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://technobok.co.za/">http://technobok.co.za/</a> bmw-m850i-2019-launch-review-8-is-an-important-number/<br /><br />Watch our drive in the new G03 BMW X3 proudly built in SA:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZDpm...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZDpm...</a><br /><br />Our drive in the recent BMW 4-Series:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR8nb...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR8nb...</a> <br /><br />Also, be sure to watch our drive in the BMW X2 20i:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg_RH...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg_RH...</a><br /><br />Our review of the luxurious BMW 740e Hybrid Electric: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5z1t...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5z1t...</a><br /><br />And, our drive in the BMW sporty M240i:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN6N1...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN6N1...</a><br /><br />Catch latest test drives &amp; reviews at: <br /><br />Twitter: @TechnoBokMedia <br /><br />Instagram: @technobok_media <br /><br />Web: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.technobok.co.za/">http://www.technobok.co.za/</a> <br /><br />Embedded Video/Logo Components: All embedded video/logo/audio components remain the property of their rightful and respective owners - all rights reserved – BMW Motor Group South Africa <br /><br />Video <br />Credits: BMW South Africa : BMW Group AG<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BMWSouth...">https://www.youtube.com/user/BMWSouth...</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BMW/videos">https://www.youtube.com/user/BMW/videos</a><br /><br />Music<br />Credits:<br /><br />Mrs. Zazzara by Loxbeats <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/loxbeats">https://soundcloud.com/loxbeats</a> Creative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported — CC BY 3.0 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...</a> Music promoted by Audio Library <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Ct2MXTilkdk">https://youtu.be/Ct2MXTilkdk</a>{% endraw %}
