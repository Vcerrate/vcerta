{% raw %}I first became aware of Jimmy O. Yang because of his role on Silicon Valley as Jian-Yang, a character whose occasionally menacing, always scene-stealing deadpan made the HBO series a must-watch comedy. From there, the Hong Kong-born actor, comic, and writer went on to the silver screen (Crazy Rich Asians), an Amazon stand-up special (Good Deal), a sitcom opposite Steve Carell and John Malkovich (Space Force), and most recently, a starring role in the holiday-season rom-com Love Hard.<br /><br />Yang's is an earnest collection, one many readers will relate to. I know I did. The only difference is that while many of us have let our first watches slip away, Yang has managed to hang onto his earliest pieces, including an anime tribute to Dragon Ball Z from his Hong Kong childhood. Join us for the watches and stay for the laughs. This is your Talking Watches with Jimmy O. Yang.<br /><br />For the full story, go to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/talking-watches-with-jimmy-o-yang">https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/talking-watches-with-jimmy-o-yang</a><br /><br />Follow HODINKEE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hodinkee/​">https://www.instagram.com/hodinkee/​</a><br />See more videos on our site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hodinkee.com/videos​">https://www.hodinkee.com/videos​</a><br />Download our podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hodinkee.com/podcasts​">https://www.hodinkee.com/podcasts​</a><br />Shop for new watches and accessories: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.hodinkee.com​">https://shop.hodinkee.com​</a><br />Shop for vintage watches: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.hodinkee.com/collections/vintage-watches">https://shop.hodinkee.com/collections/vintage-watches</a><br /><br />And don't forget to SUBSCRIBE to our channel.
