Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter. 22On judgment day many will say to me, ‘Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.’ 23But I will reply, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God’s laws.’<br /><br />Please check our playlists we cover every book in the Bible, with lots more other interesting biblical truths. <br /><br />Follow us: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/reformedchristianteaching">https://www.facebook.com/reformedchristianteaching</a><br /><br />#bibleteaching #expositorypreaching #gospel #bible #God #reformedtheology{% endraw %}
