{% raw %}Rebecca Lovell-Smith lost her historic Lyttelton home and her shop, called God Save the Queen!, in the Christchurch earthquake of 22 February 2011. But through her design work and business acumen, she has been able to adapt and survive. Rebecca's popular 'Sure to Rise' tea towels borrow elements from the Edmonds baking powder tin -- an iconic piece of Kiwiana with deep ties to Christchurch -- to communicate a message of resilience and hope.<br /><br />This video is part of a series of interviews about creative and community responses to the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes in Canterbury, New Zealand.
