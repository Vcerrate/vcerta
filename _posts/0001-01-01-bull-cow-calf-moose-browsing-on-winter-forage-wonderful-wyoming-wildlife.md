Hello! I'm Ariel. My husband and I live off grid in a tiny house (yes, one of those only 160 square feet and on wheels kind) in the western mountains of Wyoming. We split wood for heat, use water that is gravity fed from a spring, and attempt to grow as much of our own food as possible between the weather and wildlife here. <br /><br />I enjoy the stunning scenery and wildlife that I am surrounded by on a daily basis. As a child, I was fortunate enough to be able to spend much of my free time exploring and playing in the woods. Little has changed now that I'm older I suppose. I moved to a place with a bigger woods and still enjoy spending my time outside hiking, exploring, and photographing the natural world around me.<br /><br />Photography fascinates me. It is almost like a time machine, allowing a fraction of a moment in time to be frozen and shared later. Things that only last seconds or less, like a rainbow, relationships between people, the sunrise or sunset light that is constantly changing, or those fleeting interactions with wild things. It also creates a visual journal of my life. For me, photography is a mostly self taught hobby with the assistance of some very skilled friends. <br /><br />Photography is certainly one of my hobbies that gives me a great deal of pleasure. And sometimes, in between shooting photos, I take a few videos of the beauty I encounter as well. <br /><br />For more of my photography follow me on MeWe at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mewe.com/join/arielcelestephotography">https://mewe.com/join/arielcelestephotography</a><br /><br />Or to order prints or photo gifts please visit ArielCelestePhotography.zenfolio.com.{% endraw %}
