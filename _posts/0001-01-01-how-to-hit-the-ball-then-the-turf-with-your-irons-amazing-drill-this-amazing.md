I created this website as a resource just for you to support you on your golfing journey as I know how tricky learning this game can beâ€¦to say the least!<br /><br />I personally found learning the game too long and difficult in the early days. I read all the books, watched all the videos but my game was not improving. Then after studying various forms of neuro science, motor learning, psychology and personal development in less than two years I went from struggling golfer to the final stage of the Open Championship.<br /><br />On YouTube and my personal website (www.dannymaude.com) I will bring you the most up to date training, training that is getting tangible results for my clients right now.  I donâ€™t know where you are in your golfing journey, you could be just starting out or maybe your body isnâ€™t as flexible as it once was or youâ€™ve got ambitions to slash your handicap.  Wherever you are Iâ€™ve created a place here you can learn, share your ideas, ask questions and get all the support you need to enjoy this great game.<br /><br />Be prepared though. If its a quick fix you are after Im not your man. Here I will give you step-by-step advice that you can take straight to the practice ground and apply to the course but it will require you to get stuck in, screw upâ€¦a lot, practice some more and then watch those scores tumble<br /><br />Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of coaching thousands of students all around the world and if you are up for the challenge and are ready to get in the gameâ€¦LETS GO TO WORK!<br /><br />-----------------------<br />SUBSCRIBE!!<br />-----------------------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSwdmDQhAi_-ICkAvNBLEBw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSwdmDQhAi_-ICkAvNBLEBw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />This golf lesson provides a couple of wonderful drills to help you strike a ball with an iron.
