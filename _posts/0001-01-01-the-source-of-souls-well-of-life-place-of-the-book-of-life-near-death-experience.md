{% raw %}Near Death Experience N.D.E. of RÃ©gine in Alsace: &quot;&quot;Good evening Sean's friends, take this testimony as you feel. I didn't know how to develop as I would have liked to, because my English is basic. I'm not important, here, it's really the message that is. Times are difficult, if you let yourself be impregnated, always keep this distance that gives you time for reflection. Just and justly take back your place on this earth. The sojourn there could be magnificentðŸ’ž.&quot;&quot;<br />regine.nde.emi@hotmail.com<br />klein.pascal1966@gmail.com<br />When RÃ©gine from Alsace was only 7 years old, she had a game with her play friends to keep their breaths the longest possible. Then at home she went training for that to get better, and she was stuck in between the mattresses and couldn't get out anymore and consequently suffocated and died. And in this fascinating witness account for the first time ever on the internet, she explains in English, what happened in the other world, which she calls &quot;THE SOURCE&quot;, and where she rewrote her Book of Life; English is not her language so I Sean Hross helped fill in the linguistic gaps a little bit during the interview.{% endraw %}
