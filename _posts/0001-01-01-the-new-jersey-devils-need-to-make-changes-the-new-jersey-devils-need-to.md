{% raw %}The New Jersey Devils need to do something to help their roster for next season. From ownership down this organization needs to address alot of areas. There is a need for consistency with their game and The NJ Devils dont offer that game in and game out.<br />In This video I discuss coaching changes, offseason free agents, restricted free agents with forwards, defense, and goaltending.<br />Theirs alot of names that can help the Devils next season whether its Johnny Gaudreau, tomas hertz, Kris Letang, nazem Kadri, filip forsberg, John Klinger, jack campbell, Bryan rust or restricted free agents like Matthew tkachuk, patrik laine, brock boeser.  Theres alot of options that can offer a faster track to making the NHL Playoffs  next season.<br />Also talk about the NHL standings and the 2022 NHL Draft. <br />#newjerseydevils #torontomapleleafs #njdevils #jackhughes<br /><br />Follow me on Twitter @<br />The Hockey Skatedown @TSkatedown<br /><br />Follow me on Instagram  @ thehockeyskatedown<br /><br />Follow me on Facebook @ <br />hockey skatedown<br /><br />Follow Other YouTube Channel @ <br />The Superhero Scene<br /><br />Used images in video with Fair Use.<br />Fair use is a doctrine in the law of the United States that permits limited use of copyrighted material without having to first acquire permission from the copyright holder.{% endraw %}
