{% raw %}My friends, not only we're about to spray a rather complex four-tone camouflage, but we'll also make the saddest tank in history!<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/nightshiftmodeller">https://www.patreon.com/nightshiftmodeller</a><br /><br />Enjoying this type of content? Well, if you're new here, then don't be shy to subscribe and maybe even turn on notifications because I keep posting stuff like this every week!<br /><br />Disclaimer: Most of the weathering products I use in my videos such as Ammo by Mig Jimenez, AK-Interactive, Wilder and VMS were sent to me for free, but with no obligations to promote them. I received a lot of them a long time ago, even before I started this channel. VMS is also one of my Patreon supporters. Being independent from big and exclusive sponsorship deals and showing you a wide variety of different brands and products was one of the founding ideas of this channel and I will always stand by this. <br /><br />Music: Quincas Moreira - Scratch the Itch - Youtube Audio Library{% endraw %}
