{% raw %}Kit Dale shows shows one concept that can change your whole game when applied to BJJ.<br /><br />Learning jiu jitsu is a skill and an art. You have to approach it the most effective way and unfortunately all schools don't do that. some of you may be exposed to random techniques from your instructor, a lot of warmup and little to no positional sparring. You may also feel that your conceptual understanding of jiu jitsu could use some structure. In that case you may be interested in my master project.<br /><br />🚨 KITDALETRAINING.COM 🚨<br />🎥Online Instructional videos<br />💥THE ART OF LEARNING JIU JITSU 💥<br />🥋By x2 World Pro Champ &amp; BJJ Black Belt Kit Dale<br />________<br /><br />✍🏻TESTIMONIALS<br />“It's honestly by far the greatest content I've seen on BJJ and I've bought, watched, and read over 50 hours of content in just this year alone.” Antoine B.<br /><br />“Kit Dale’s conceptual approach really works for me. As someone who only started training late in their early 30s it feels like a much more efficient way to learn. Which is important considering I have to scrape together hours to train each week between work and family commitments.” Cam G.<br /><br />&quot;I watched volume 1 of The Art of Jiu Jitsu. Then I went to class and instantaneously performed effortless sweeps and maintained my base in every roll. I am shocked at how 3 principles stated out loud improved my game.&quot; Sean R.<br /><br />&quot;The approach to Jiu Jitsu outlined in your videos are pure gold. Kit Dale is the Tim Ferris of Jiu Jitsu! Thank you for putting this out. I have a new plan for learning and to teach my wife &amp; kids.&quot; Mike K.<br /><br />________<br /><br />📌FOLLOW KIT DALE<br />🌎 KitDaleTraining.com<br />📸 instagram.com/kit_dale_official<br />📸 instagram.com/kitdalebjj<br />💻 facebook.com/kitdale<br />🐦 twitter.com/kitdalebjj{% endraw %}
