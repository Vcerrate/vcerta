{% raw %}In the rarified air of the world’s wildest mountains, alpinist Graham Zimmerman has seen firsthand the effects of human-driven climate change on the world. He has seen glaciers recede, winters become shorter, and weather patterns become more volatile. As his eyes have been opened to the irreversible damage that humans are doing to the planet, he has been forced to acknowledge that he is complicit in destroying these places that he loves​. Despite his own carbon footprint, Graham decides that he must take action and joins Protect Our Winters, an advocacy group that enlists him in the fight against Climate Change. In doing so, he starts down the path of advocacy in an increasingly turbulent world. A world that will challenge him in many ways, not least of all, by asking if he can accept​ his imperfections to become an effective advocate.<br /><br />www.instagram.com/grahamzimmerman<br /><br />Subscribe <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Outsidetelevision">https://www.youtube.com/c/Outsidetelevision</a><br /><br />Head to  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://watch.outsidetv.com/">http://watch.outsidetv.com/</a> to download the FREE Outside TV App and find other ways to stream Outside TV<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.outsidetv.com/">http://www.outsidetv.com/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/outsidetv/">https://www.facebook.com/outsidetv/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Outside_TV">https://twitter.com/Outside_TV</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/outsidetv/">https://www.instagram.com/outsidetv/</a><br /><br />Have your own adventure video you want to share with the world?
