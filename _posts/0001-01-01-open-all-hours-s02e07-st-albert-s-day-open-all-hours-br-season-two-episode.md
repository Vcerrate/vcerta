{% raw %}Open All Hours<br />Season Two, Episode Seven - 5 Apr. 1981<br /><br />To the envy of Granville who has never attended one,Arkwright is taking Nurse Gladys to a wedding and has taken his old suit out of moth-balls, but it still reeks of camphor. Nurse Gladys makes him hang it out of the car window as they drive along but the trousers end up under a tractor's wheels. Thank goodness Nurse Gladys is wearing a trouser suit.{% endraw %}
