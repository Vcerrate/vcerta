{% raw %}The Navy's new LOCUST (Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology) launchers fire a swarm of drones that can jam enemy communications, and waste enemy resources by drawing fire. The launchers are capable of tube-launching 31 drones in just 40 seconds. The drones can fly autonomously but can also be controlled manually.<br /><br />At just $15,000 a unit, the drones are expendable and can be used in dangerous situations. LOCUS is now in its development and testing phase.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Follow BI Video on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs">http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs</a><br />Follow BI on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n">http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n</a><br />Read more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/">http://www.businessinsider.com/</a><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Business Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.
