{% raw %}Hello and welcome!  In this video, I will show you how to step up an inexpensive wooden easel using silicone molds and air dry clay.  Framing all of your artwork can get expensive, not to mention the issue with wall space.  I display my art on these easels throughout my home and change the paintings depending on the season, holiday or my mood.  This little DIY project is inexpensive, fun and so pretty.  I hope you give this a try and be sure to share with me on my Facebook page.  I'd love to see how yours turns out.<br /><br />Follow me on Facebook to see more of my art and share yours with me - www.facebook.com/VivoVintageDesigns<br /><br />SUPPLIES:<br />Easels<br />*MEEDEN 6Inch 24Pcs Mini Natural Pine Wood Display Easel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3KQ2gWo">https://amzn.to/3KQ2gWo</a><br /><br />Mold<br />*Neepanda DIY Baroque Scroll Relief Cake Border Silicone Molds - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/33Yun51">https://amzn.to/33Yun51</a><br /><br />CLAY<br />*Creative Paper clay, 8 Ounces, White - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3IHvMLP">https://amzn.to/3IHvMLP</a>  <br />*Sculpey Air-Dry Porcelainâ„¢ White, Non Toxic, Air Dry Clay, 1.1 pound bar - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3IJ9R7b">https://amzn.to/3IJ9R7b</a><br /><br />PALETTE KNIFE<br />*HTS 316S7 7&quot; Small Wood Handle Stainless Steel Palette Knife - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3g5nVM0">https://amzn.to/3g5nVM0</a><br /><br />CORN STARCH<br />*Rumford, Corn Starch, 12 oz - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3o4snPy">https://amzn.to/3o4snPy</a><br /><br />*As an Amazon Associate I earn a small commission on qualifying purchases made through the links above at no extra cost to you.<br /><br />*Paypal tip jar - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://paypal.me/jeannettevivo">http://paypal.me/jeannettevivo</a>{% endraw %}
