{% raw %}#Piaget #ProfEd #TeacherEducation<br /><br />Piaget conceptualizes moral development as a constructivist process, whereby the interplay of action and thought builds moral concepts.<br /><br />Piaget (1932) was principally interested not in what children do (i.e., in whether they break rules or not) but in what they think. In other words he was interested in childrenâ€™s moral reasoning.{% endraw %}
