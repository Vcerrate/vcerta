{% raw %}If you need to clear off space from your Mac's hard drive, there are some places you should look first. You may have some old iPhone backups, installers, or other downloaded files.

Applications store support files and caches in your Library folder, but they may not have been cleaned up when you uninstalled the app.<br />#Mac #Clean #Storage #AppleOnlineAcademy<br /><br />THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW<br />----------<br />üé¨ - MOST RECENT VIDEOS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfOhIXyb0UKJ02s0gVkqTRA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfOhIXyb0UKJ02s0gVkqTRA?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />üéì - LEARN MORE AT THE APPLEONLINEACADEMY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://appleonlineacademy.com">https://appleonlineacademy.com</a> and get 50% OFF from complete macOS Big Sur course.<br /><br />‚è± TIMESTAMPS<br />0:00 Intro<br />0:50 Clean Storage with Recommendations <br />3:00 Clean Storage Manually <br />7:25 Clean Up System Files<br /><br />SOCIAL<br />----------<br />üìù - BLOG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://appleonlineacademy.com/blog/">https://appleonlineacademy.com/blog/</a><br />üõ†Ô∏è - AppleOnlineAcademy SUPPORT: appleonlineacademy@gmail.com <br />üë• - FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AppleOnlineAcademy">https://www.facebook.com/AppleOnlineAcademy</a>{% endraw %}
