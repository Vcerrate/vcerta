A judge who decides a case on the merits considers that any technical or procedural issues that have been raised are either dealt with or irrelevant. The purpose of deciding cases in this way is to ensure that justice is done, rather than reward or punish one of the parties unfairly because of adherence to, or failure to follow, procedural requirements.{% endraw %}
