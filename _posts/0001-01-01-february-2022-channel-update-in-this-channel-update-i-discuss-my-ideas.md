{% raw %}In this channel update, I discuss my ideas for upcoming LPs.<br /><br />For this recording, I decided to use OBS, since Shadowplay does not support the game.  I may consider a separate tech demo with some actual combat, to see how well OBS can keep up with it.<br /><br />To summarize my plans, I'm going to play Final Fantasy IV Pixel next, possibly with 100% achievements, which would include all of the rare summons and the Adamant Armor.  However, if I find that it takes me multiple days of farming, I may just skip them, but I would like to try to acquire them.<br /><br />Currently, I don't plan on bonus episodes of Bravely Default, even if it was just a few of them for the bosses.  I may change my mind, but it seems like too much time for not enough content.<br /><br />Hopefully, I'll be able to have Bravely Second ready by the time I finish FF4.  I've just had a lot of difficulty figuring out the game, but I'm getting there.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2980168">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2980168</a><br />Here's my Patreon profile, if you're interested in supporting me there.
