{% raw %}In this episode, James Reeves reviews the modern Welrod pistol, the B&amp;T Station Six. The Station Six is truly a real life spy gun and a modernized take on the integrally suppressed Welrod pistol from the World War II era. This Swiss 9mm bolt-action pistol with removeable integral suppressor could be one of the quietest guns ever made, but is it worth the $2,250 street price these are going for? Watch today's video to get James' opinion and to hear the Station Six in action.<br /><br />««« GEAR USED IN THIS VIDEO »»»<br />• Recommended Subsonic Ammo - Federal Syntech 150gr <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3Nh708w">https://bit.ly/3Nh708w</a><br />• James' Sunglasses of Choice: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Iso4F4">https://amzn.to/3Iso4F4</a><br />• Oakley Ballistic M-Frame Shooting Glasses: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3tg58Uj">https://amzn.to/3tg58Uj</a><br />• Walker Razor Slim Electronic Muffs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3CdwC1b">https://amzn.to/3CdwC1b</a><br />• Apparel: All TFBTV apparel is sponsored by 5.11 Tactical and you can get it at www.511tactical.com<br /><br />««« GUN AND GEAR GIVEAWAYS »»»<br />Check out our Utreon and SubscribeStar pages if you enjoy our program, and consider helping us at TFBTV out.
