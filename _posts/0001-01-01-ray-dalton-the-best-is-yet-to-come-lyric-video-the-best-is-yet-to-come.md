{% raw %}The best is yet to come is everything we’ve been looking forward to. After all the ups and downs in life, know that we’re so close to where we want to be. Looking back, I appreciate my personal journey, and I’m so happy to be where I am now. While listening to this song, I hope everyone can reminisce on their own journey and know that the best is yet to come. <br /><br />Stream or download the single: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://raydalton.lnk.to/TBIYTC">https://raydalton.lnk.to/TBIYTC</a><br /><br />Follow Ray<br />►Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/raydaltonmusic/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/raydaltonmusic/?hl=en</a><br />►Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://open.spotify.com/album/2zs4alV54L7X8B0lNghrG7">http://open.spotify.com/album/2zs4alV54L7X8B0lNghrG7</a><br />►TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@raydaltonmusic?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@raydaltonmusic?lang=en</a><br /><br />Lyrics:<br />Like a song on the radio<br />Follows me wherever I go<br />All my troubles playing on repeat in my head<br />The more I try to drown it out<br />The more it comes back around<br />It’s got a hold on me<br />A hold on me<br /><br />Back when I was 14 I had my first heartbreak<br />didn’t wanna leave my room for days<br />It felt like the end of the world<br /><br />My mama used to say oh son<br />Some days you’ll get it wrong<br />When every little step feels heavy you got to carry on The best is yet to come<br />So when I’m feeling low<br />And Every time my soul gets heavy I know that I ain’t done<br />The best is yet to come<br /><br />Every year I start with a wish<br />Say I’m gonna be an optimist<br />Oh by February<br />My heart’s half empty<br /><br />PRE:<br />When I feel like I’m running out of better days<br />I look up the wall and then I see your face <br />I know it's not the end of the world<br /><br />My mama used to say oh son<br />Some days you’ll get it wrong<br />When every little step feels heavy you got to carry on<br />The best is yet to come<br />So when I’m feeling low<br />And Every time my soul gets heavy<br />I know that I ain’t done<br />The best is yet to come<br /><br />When I feel like I’m running out of better days<br />I look up the wall and when I see your face{% endraw %}
