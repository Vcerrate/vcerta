{% raw %}If you were as excited as I was to see the Stealth propellers for the Mavic Air 2, you know how disappointing this is for me.  Master Airscrew props are the best in the business, but something went wrong with these. <br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />I got this response from Master Airscrew this morning: <br /><br />“ First of all, thank you for sharing this thread on the Mavicpilots forum.<br /><br />My colleagues have acknowledged this issue for some of our props and are already replacing some equipment to fix this. It's also the reason we have some delay in shipping now which should be solved by the end of the week.<br /><br />Please feel free to post this reply on the forum as well, so people are informed on time.”<br /><br />Want to support my testing?
