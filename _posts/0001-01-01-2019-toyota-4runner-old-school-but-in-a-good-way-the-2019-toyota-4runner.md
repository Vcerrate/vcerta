{% raw %}The 2019 Toyota 4Runner may be living on decade-old DNA, but its old-school feel adds to a compelling off-road resume.<br /> <br />Shop for the 2019 Toyota 4Runner on CarGurus: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cargur.us/v7sGd">https://cargur.us/v7sGd</a><br /> <br />With a naturally aspirated, 4.0-liter V6 engine mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission, the 4Runner makes good power (270 horsepower and 278 pound-feet of torque)—but not good fuel economy. 4-wheel-driver versions of the 4Runner return a paltry 17 mpg city, 20 highway, 18 combined.  That said, the TRD trims also offer impressive off-road equipment, including a locking rear differential, Multi-Terrain Select, and crawl control. If you choose the top-of-the-line TRD Pro, you’ll also enjoy Fox Racing shocks, TRD-tuned front springs, and a thicker front skid plate.<br /> <br />Inside, the Toyota 4Runner features a small 6.1-inch touchscreen (roughly the size of a smartphone) and no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto support. Back-to-basics interior features include chunky knobs and dials to control the Entune infotainment system and a familiar and straightforward display.<br /> <br />Safety is also a sore point for the 4Runner. Although it manages 4 out of 5 stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the 4Runner doesn’t come with any advanced safety equipment outside of airbags, traction control, and a reversing camera.<br /> <br />On the positive side, the 4Runner has plenty of space. It easily bests its primary competitor, the 4-door Jeep Wrangler, with nearly 90 cubic feet behind the rear seats (putting it almost in Chevy Tahoe territory). Pricing ranges from $35,310 to over $46,000, but in a market full of soft-roading crossovers, this true off-roader stands apart from the crowd.<br /> <br />For more information on the 2019 Toyota 4Runner, read George’s full review on CarGurus: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cargur.us/v7sFh">https://cargur.us/v7sFh</a><br /><br />Presenter: George Kennedy<br />Cinematography: Venn Creative Media<br /><br />Subscribe to the CarGurus Channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/cargurus">https://www.youtube.com/c/cargurus</a><br /><br />Check out our Test Drive Reviews playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLih2CvHcvvNPa7Z68XVGYqCTr365h4tXz">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLih2CvHcvvNPa7Z68XVGYqCTr365h4tXz</a><br /><br />Crossovers &amp; SUVs<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLih2CvHcvvNM7dUifLm4faH8wQQVXBojz">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLih2CvHcvvNM7dUifLm4faH8wQQVXBojz</a>{% endraw %}
