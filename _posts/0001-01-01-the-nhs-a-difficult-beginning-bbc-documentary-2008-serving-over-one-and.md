{% raw %}BBC documentary (2008):  Serving over one and a half million patients and their families every day, the NHS is the biggest service of its kind in the world. It is universally regarded as a national treasure - the most remarkable achievement of post war Britain.<br /><br />Yet, surprisingly, the National Health Service very nearly did not happen at all. In the months leading to its launch it was bitterly opposed - by the Tory Party and the national press. But its most vicious and vocal opponents were the very people its existence depended on - surgeons, nurses, dentists and Britain's 20,000 doctors. To get the NHS at all required the persistence and determination of one man - Nye Bevan, Labour's minister of health.<br /><br />This film tells the extraordinary story of the six months leading up to its traumatic birth.<br /><br />Narrator: Imelda Staunton | Director: Ian MacMillan | Producer: Mark Hayhurst | Executive Producer for the BBC: Charlotte Moore | Executive Producer: Edmund Coulthard | Executive Producer: Grant McKee<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/841244?view=credit">http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/841244?view=credit</a>{% endraw %}
