{% raw %}In late 1975, CBS Musical Instruments decided to drop the Fender name from the Rhodes line of products, in order to establish Rhodes as its own brand. The Rhodes Suitcase Piano and Rhodes Mark I Stage Piano continued to be produced in 73- and 88-key configurations.<br /><br />Aside from the new logos, there were two main differences between the Fender Rhodes and Rhodes Mark I pianos: the hammers and the tines. These differences were small ones, but they still had a noticeable impact on the pianos tone. The new hammers were completely plastic, reducing the weight of the piano while retaining the same shape and replaceable Neoprene tips. The tines featured a swaged design, tapered in a way that made them 4 times more durable than the previous generation. The combination of these improvements produced the more mellow, less bell-like sound heard on most Rhodes recordings from the late 70s.{% endraw %}
