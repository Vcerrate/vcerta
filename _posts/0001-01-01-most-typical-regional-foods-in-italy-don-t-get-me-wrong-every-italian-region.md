{% raw %}Don't get me wrong: every Italian region has dozens of typical foods. I had to choose a selection. Some of them were challenging to pick up from a huge selection of possibilities. <br />Furthermore, it may happen that someone who lives in the north like me does not even know certain dishes from the south, and vice versa.<br />So, let's discover the most typical food of every Italian region (in my opinion).<br /><br />Please consider subscribing to the channel and follow me on Instagram: www.instagram.com/italianauts <br />I will show you a lot of interesting Italian places and food. <br /><br />#italy #food #map<br /><br />Music license by Artlist: <br />Piggyback - Dan Pundak{% endraw %}
