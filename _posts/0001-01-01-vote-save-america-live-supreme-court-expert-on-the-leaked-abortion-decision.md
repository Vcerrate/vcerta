{% raw %}We planned an event to talk about the 2022 midterm map. But then… things changed. <br /><br />First, we want to acknowledge what a grave and scary moment this is. On Monday, a Supreme Court draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, was leaked to the press, suggesting that a majority of justices are prepared to overrule Roe vs Wade. If (and when) Roe vs Wade is overturned, at least 23 states will immediately or shortly thereafter have bans or extremely severe restrictions on abortion. That won’t end abortion in those states, but it will end safe abortions, causing needless deaths, disproportionately among low-income and minority women. If you’re reading this and feeling overwhelmed, scared, or sad, we’re right there with you, and are sending you our love and solidarity. <br /><br />In light of this news, we’re switching things up for our event this evening at 7:30 ET/4:30 PT. Law professor, Strict Scrutiny co-host, and Supreme Court expert Leah Litman is joining us to talk through the draft decision and what comes next in the fight to secure reproductive justice.<br /><br />With our constitutionally protected right to abortion under attack, abortion funds are working nonstop to make sure people can still access (and afford) abortion.<br />Visit votesaveamerica.com/roe to learn more, donate, and take action.{% endraw %}
