{% raw %}With the alarming onset of food shortages and the global food crisis rapidly accelerating toward us, discussing the inevitable crash of the markets and other economic problems is secondary to me right now. <br /><br />Today I'm going to discuss the meat and egg shortage warnings from supermarkets and the strange increases in the rates of animal diseases in recent weeks. I will also delve into their plans for us to transition to lab-made meat, milk, and fish.<br /><br />As I mentioned in my previous video, the reduced production or entire shutdowns of fertilizer factories across the globe, one after another, demonstrates that their plan is working in a systematic way. Although your shelves may be fully stocked now, this will not continue. Seeing empty shelves only shows you the result of one segment of their plan in regards to vegetables, carbohydrates, and other products made from agricultural products, which are humanityâ€™s primary food sources. However, they also have a design for our other sources of food. Namely, meat, seafood, eggs, and milk- our primary protein sources. <br /><br />When supermarket CEOs and supply chain distributors evaluate problems, they generally focus on the loss of labor force, rising shipping costs, and supply chain issues. Yes, They are right, But there are other factors that make the story even uglier.<br /><br />There are new developments that are further complicating the situation. One of these is the animal diseases spreading all over the world, which will directly affect meat and egg shortages. The first cases of the reemergence of the Avian flu we heard of were in Israel, and now we see that it has spread to farms all over Europe, East Asia, and the United States as well.<br /><br />I would also like to draw attention to the latest news on Canada and  Australiaâ€™s food shortage. Because of labor shortages and supply chain issues, Canadaâ€™s food manufacturers are struggling to find raw ingredients and are not able to fulfill demand, but say they are focusing on essential products to consumers, which means other more non-essential products will be more limited.<br /><br />Itâ€™s very clear we will experience extreme shortages of meat and eggs soon. Itâ€™s not just a prediction, but experts around the world are confirming this. It wonâ€™t stop at this. The problems will trickle down to other products in the coming months.<br /><br />No one wants to hear the truth, but itâ€™s necessary. So as I always say- be prepared!<br /><br />#foodshortage #foodcrisis #emptyshelves<br /><br />00:00 | Food Shortage 2022 Accelerates<br />00:38 | Empty shelves in local grocery stores<br />02:00 | Their primary agenda for 2022 is the global food crisis<br />03:02 | The meat &amp; egg shortage warnings from supermarkets<br />04:33 | The animal diseases spreading all over the world<br />05:09 | Europe is experiencing the greatest avian flu epidemic itâ€™s ever seen<br />06:09 | In addition to the crisis in the supply chain and loss of labor force, this is likely to take a heavy toll on food shortages<br />09:12 | Canada food shortage &amp; supply chain crisis<br />09:38 | Canada trucker shortage<br />10:02 | Australia food shortage &amp; supply chain crisis<br />10:21 | The coming storms will leave a large number of market shelves empty<br />11:03 | Lab-made meat - Lab-made milk - lab-grown fish<br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ To learn the truth and prepare yourself for the future, keep watching Financial Argument. <br /><br />ðŸ‘‰  References, Charts &amp; Full Transcription: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://financialargument.net/food-shortage-2022-animal-diseases-spread-worldwide-meat-egg-shortages">https://financialargument.net/food-shortage-2022-animal-diseases-spread-worldwide-meat-egg-shortages</a><br /><br />ðŸš¨ All Rights Reserved Â© 2022 Financial Argumentâ„¢ <br />ðŸš¨ Footages By Financial Argumentâ„¢ Team<br /><br />ðŸš¨ DISCLAIMER: The financial and political opinions expressed in this video are not necessarily of &quot;Financial Argument&quot; or its staff.
