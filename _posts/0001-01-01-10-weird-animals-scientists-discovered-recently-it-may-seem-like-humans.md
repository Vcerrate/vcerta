{% raw %}It may seem like humans have found everything there is to find on the entire planet, and in some ways, we have. But the Earth still has its secrets, we've barely just scratched the surface. Every year, scientists discover hundreds of new animal and insect species. According to scientists, a significant portion of Earth's living creatures is still unknown. It's estimated that 86 to 99 percent of species have yet to be discovered. From a millipede whose name is inspired by Taylor Swift to an Orange Bat and a fish that could easily pass off as an alien here are 10 of the Weirdest Animals Scientists Discovered Recently. <br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ">https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ</a><br /><br />Watch our “10 Scariest Criminals That Are Still On The Loose&quot;<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/i1btxwKq7_o">https://youtu.be/i1btxwKq7_o</a> <br />Watch our “10 Times People Got Stuck In Strange Places&quot;<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SradHi4hTE4">https://youtu.be/SradHi4hTE4</a> <br />Watch our “10 Dangerous Men You Never Want To Mess With&quot;<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/KyeYo9zEaMs">https://youtu.be/KyeYo9zEaMs</a><br /><br />World’s Smallest Reptile<br /><br />Brookesia nana, or B. nana for short, is a new species of chameleon that was discovered in a rainforest deep inside northern Madagascar.  This nano-chameleon is about the size of a seed and could very well be the tiniest reptile to ever exist! The tiny lizard is so small that someone with bad eyesight could hardly even see it. <br /><br />The discovery of such a small reptile raises intriguing questions about how vertebra life can exist at such small body sizes. It also highlights Madagascar's incredible—and critically endangered—biodiversity, according to scientists. The researchers who discovered this species believe that the tiny lizard will soon be extinct because of how vulnerable it is becoming due to deforestation in its home region. <br /><br />Orange Furred Bat<br /><br />A group of scientists discovered a fuzzy orange species of bat in the caves and mining tunnels of Guinea's Nimba Mountains. Called the Myotis namibiensis, this newly discovered species is named after its home mountains, which are described as &quot;African sky islands,&quot; with peaks rising 1,600 to 1,750 meters above sea level. <br /><br />Despite only recently being discovered the bats are thought to be near extinction. Bat Conservation International and the local mining company Société des Mines de Fer de Guinée are working together to improve their habitats by strengthening the tunnels and caves so that the bats can continue to live safely in the mountain.<br /><br /><br /><br />Follow Us On Social Media <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► For copyright issues, send us an email at : factsjunkie@gmail.com{% endraw %}
