{% raw %}This animation shows spin waves propagating through an antiferromagnetic material, in which neighboring atoms (balls) have opposite spins (arrows). When a photon, or light particle (gold ball), of the right wavelength hits an atom and perturbs its spin, the disturbance spreads like ripples in water. These spin waves can be detected with a technique called RIXS, which analyzes the energy and momentum of photons emitted by the disturbed material. An international study led by Stanford and SLAC scientists has found unusual behaviors of spin waves in a superconducting copper oxide material. The next step is to see whether and how this new excitation is related to the materialâ€™s ability to conduct electricity with 100 percent efficiency.
