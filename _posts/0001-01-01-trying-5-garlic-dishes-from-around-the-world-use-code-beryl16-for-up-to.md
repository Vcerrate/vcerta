Season with salt and add the oil to the paste, pouring it in a thin streak like when you make mayonnaise. Mash the garlic as finely as possible and add it to the bean paste, then add pepper and a pinch of paprika powder (more for the look). Taste everything and adjust to your preferences (sometimes I put more garlic or salt or oil, it depends). Eat on simple toasted bread (a more dense white bread with a crust and toasted well would be my choice).<br />Optional (yummy) topping and side:<br />Tomato-onion sauce: chop the onion in thin long slices and sauté it with a bit of oil. When it is well cooked, season to taste and add the tomato juice. When it's all done, add it as a topping to the beans. Definitely worth adding: pickled cucumbers on the side (salty pickles!).<br /><br />Czech česnečka:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mission-food.com/cesnecka-czech-garlic-soup-aka-hangover/">https://mission-food.com/cesnecka-czech-garlic-soup-aka-hangover/</a><br /><br />Chinese Laba Garlic: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pandacheffy.medium.com/laba-garlic-%E8%85%8A%E5%85%AB%E8%92%9C-f6156cd3c905">https://pandacheffy.medium.com/laba-garlic-%E8%85%8A%E5%85%AB%E8%92%9C-f6156cd3c905</a><br /><br />Bangladeshi/Indian Lahsun Bhorta<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42V-Q9V5R70">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42V-Q9V5R70</a><br /><br />Indian Garlic Kheer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://recipes.timesofindia.com/us/recipes/garlic-kheer/rs55371319.cms">https://recipes.timesofindia.com/us/recipes/garlic-kheer/rs55371319.cms</a><br />More on Garlic Kheer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/benami-kheer-or-garlic-kheer-how-to-make-ups-famous-lehsun-ki-kheer-2340037">https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/benami-kheer-or-garlic-kheer-how-to-make-ups-famous-lehsun-ki-kheer-2340037</a><br /><br />Time Codes: <br />00:00 Intro <br />00:25 Romanian Fasole Batuta<br />01:49 Trying Romanian Fasole Batuta<br />02:47 Artist of the Day Abby Hubbard<br />03:15 Czech Česnečka<br />04:23 Trying Česnečka<br />06:08 Hello Fresh!<br />07:30 Chinese Laba Garlic <br />09:38 Trying Chinese Laba Garlic<br />11:31 Bangladeshi/Indian Rosun Bhorta<br />13:25 Trying Rosun Bhorta<br />16:09 Indian Lahsun Ki Kheer<br />17:18 Trying Garlic Kheer <br /><br />_____________________<br />Where I get my earrings with a little discount code! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/32k14">https://shrsl.com/32k14</a><br />Pops of Color aka the Microgreen kit I swear by: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/32k93">https://shrsl.com/32k93</a><br /><br />Wanna mail something?<br />Beryl Shereshewsky<br />115 East 34th Street FRNT 1<br />PO Box 1742<br />New York, NY 10156<br /><br />Follow me on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shereshe/">https://www.instagram.com/shereshe/</a><br />Support me on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/beryl">https://www.patreon.com/beryl</a>{% endraw %}
