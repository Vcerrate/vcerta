{% raw %}Today we’ll be looking over the best vertical mobility abilities that players can use in the game, or abilities that allow your character to move in ways that are different from a normal run speed increase.  And also we won’t be looking at toys, profession items, or zone gear items, since they could make another video on their own.  These abilities are very handy when trying to get somewhere up high or low without taking fall damage, and this video was written while the writer was trying to reach treasures in Zereth Mortis before flying was available. <br /><br />Video edited by Felplague and Splitrift.
