{% raw %}In this video, I show you an easy Math trick that you can use to read anyone's mind! All that you have to do is make them choose a number between 1 and 10, and have them go through a series of mathematical operations using that number. If they have done the Math correctly, they will end up with 3 as their final number! It's actually not a real magic trick, but it simply uses Math to lead the person to end up with the number 3, regardless of the first number that they chose to start with! <br /><br />CONNECT WITH ME:<br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mikechimmy/">https://www.instagram.com/mikechimmy/</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=helpfuldiy">https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=helpfuldiy</a><br /><br />FREE DIY ADVICE EBOOK:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gumroad.com/l/vFujc">https://gumroad.com/l/vFujc</a><br /><br />Disclaimer: Some of the links in this description may be affiliate links.
