{% raw %}I was fortunate to get my hands on 2 very old and overly loved skillets. The build-up on the pans was extreme and I need to bring out my grinder to get through many, many years of carbon buildup. In this video, I show you the steps that I used to get these pans back into useful shape and ready for another lifetime of use. <br /><br />Restoration of these cast iron skillets was not quick but it was an enjoyable process and stopped 2 pans from going in the garbage.{% endraw %}
