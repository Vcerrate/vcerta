{% raw %}Pietta Brand Cap and Ball Revolvers are the cheapest priced models on the market, and they do leave a lot to be desired.  This is a look at my first (and only) Pietta revolver (1861 Navy Sherriff's Model) that I've had for a year and what was wrong with it and what went wrong throughout the year. <br /><br />Full Article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blackpowderguide.com/pietta-black-powder-revolver-review/">https://blackpowderguide.com/pietta-black-powder-revolver-review/</a> <br /><br />With any black powder revolver, you're going to have to do some post-purchase gunsmithing.  No brand is exempt from that.  <br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with my Pietta for the knowledge that I've gained about the mechanics of how a cap and ball revolver works, as I've done a bit of work with this one.  In fact,  as you will see in the video, I still have some work to do to make the revolver reliable.<br /><br />Going forward, I'm not sure if I will purchase another, but if you're looking for the most inexpensive brand to get your feet wet in the hobby, then Pietta is an excellent choice.  <br /><br />You'll learn a lot, repair a lot, and they shoot well.  Fit and finish leave something to be desired, but for a field gun that you just want to have fun with, you can't go wrong with Pietta.{% endraw %}
