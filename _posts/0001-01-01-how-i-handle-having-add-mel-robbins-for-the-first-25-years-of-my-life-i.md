{% raw %}For the first 25 years of my life I dealt with severe panic and anxiety. There were several things I did to cope with complete overwhelm and lack of focus and clarity -- mostly procrastinate until the very last minute, ask for extra time on papers in college, and cross my fingers someone could bail me out of a tight situation. It wasn't until I was 47 years old that I learned something that would completely change how I relate to my own inability to focus, to become seriously distracted, and feeling like I was the most unorganized person I know...I was diagnosed with ADD.<br /><br />Stephanie sent in a question about how I deal with it, the pros and cons, and how I treat it. What's so interested about ADD, especially in Generation X women, is that we have been misdiagnosed for decades as having ANXIETY, when some of us may actually have been struggling with a learning disability. <br /><br />The article I reference in this video is here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://qz.com/592364/decades-of-failing-to-recognize-adhd-in-girls-has-created-a-lost-generation-of-women/">https://qz.com/592364/decades-of-failing-to-recognize-adhd-in-girls-has-created-a-lost-generation-of-women/</a><br /><br />In the comments, I'd love to hear your stories of either struggling or dealing with anxiety/ADD or any other disorder. I hope the information I share in this #AskMel helps you! <br /><br />--- <br /><br />Subscribe to the channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=melrobbinslive">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=melrobbinslive</a><br /><br />--- <br /><br />Follow me here: <br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/melrobbinslive">http://instagram.com/melrobbinslive</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/melrobbins">http://facebook.com/melrobbins</a> <br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://melrobbins.com">http://melrobbins.com</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/melrobbins">http://twitter.com/melrobbins</a>{% endraw %}
