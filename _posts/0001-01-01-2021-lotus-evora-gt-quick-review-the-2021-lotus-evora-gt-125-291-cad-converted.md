{% raw %}The 2021 Lotus Evora GT ($125,291 CAD converted, $98,945 USD starting) is a lightweight precision sports car with a mid-engined supercharged V6 that makes a strong 416 horsepower. Available with optional rear seats, the Evora GT can carry up to 4 people and was available in either a 6-speed manual or 6 speed automatic. It also came standard with hydraulically-assisted steering and a Torsen limited-slip differential when mated with the 6-speed manual. With formidable power, a lightweight chassis, and all sorts of sports car goodies, will the Lotus Evora GT live up to Thomas and Jamesâ€™ expectations? Watch to find out what they think!
