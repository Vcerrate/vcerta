{% raw %}A very personal video this time because a year ago today I lost a very close friend and life long RC flyer, Pete Taylor. We had worked together for many years and after his passing this model was left to me. I go into more details in the video on the model and its history. Pete you are sorely missed and my thoughts as always go out to your loving family.<br /><br />Links below for the talking points from the video as mentioned:<br /><br />RCGroups Savex Spitfire Community build thread:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?1486614-Savex-Spitfire-Mk-Vb-the-Ultimate-ARF!">https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?1486614-Savex-Spitfire-Mk-Vb-the-Ultimate-ARF!</a><br /><br />Link to Essential RC's video of my Savex Mk5 Spitfire:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/cUCC7mfRBpg">https://youtu.be/cUCC7mfRBpg</a><br /><br />Link to my old channel with video of maiden of my Savex Mk5 Spitfire:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/h6_IrJ5p39U">https://youtu.be/h6_IrJ5p39U</a><br /><br />Thanks for tuning in and please do comment if you'd like to see an Avios Mk1a Spitfire too.
