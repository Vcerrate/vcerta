{% raw %}OK Guys, its time to get up to date on the latest Montreal Canadiens news with regards to their general manager hunt. TSN insider Pierre Lebrun gave some updates yesterday, alongside sportsnet's Eric Engels, both saying that the list of candidates are down to 3 - 4 people. In this video, we take a look at each remaining candidate, and at the end I give my prediction on who I think, will be the Habs next GM. <br /><br />Let me know in the comment sectino who YOU think will get the position, does anybody still have some hope that Patrick Roy maybe gets the job, or is everybody coming to terms that its either going to be one of the 3 listed in this video?<br /><br />If your a fan of the Habs, or just hockey in general, than please consider subscribing to my channel, as I upload a tonne of hockey content, and would really enjoy, having some more of you grasshoppers, tag along for the ride!<br /><br />To support my channel , consider slapping that Join button and become a member today..
