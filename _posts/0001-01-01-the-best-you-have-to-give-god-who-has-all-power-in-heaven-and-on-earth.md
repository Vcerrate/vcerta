{% raw %}God, who has all power in heaven and on earth, is looking for people who want to worship Him. Everyone is worshipping something. Are you worshipping God? Itâ€™s not a matter of WHO you will worship, but WHEN. A day will come when every knee shall bow. Now is the time to choose wisely. We must give God our very best. Worshipping Him is priceless and absolutely life-changing!{% endraw %}
