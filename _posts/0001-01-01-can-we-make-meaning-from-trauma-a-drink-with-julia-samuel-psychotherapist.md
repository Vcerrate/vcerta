{% raw %}Psychotherapist Julia Samuel chats to Idler editor Tom Hodgkinson about her new book, 'Every Family Has A Story: How We Inherit Love and Loss.' <br /><br />In her book, Julia explores the complexities of how families influence the individual. Through a collection of eight family narratives, which read like short stories, Julia offers healing, sensitive insights into how trauma is passed down through generations – or how it can be stopped. It is an utterly fascinating book, in which descriptions of specific situations allow you to reassess much about your own life for the better.

As Julia tells us, &quot;Trauma is never inevitable. It’s about the meaning you make of your experience.&quot; <br /><br />This is the beginning of an eye-opening discussion available to magazine and Academy subscribers - to watch the full recording, visit the website to join: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.idler.co.uk/">https://www.idler.co.uk/</a><br /><br />Julia Samuel, MBE, is a leading British psychotherapist and the author of the Sunday Times bestsellers This Too Shall Pass and Grief Works.
