{% raw %}In this video, Dynamic Structural Analysis is introduced. <br />The difference between Dynamic and Static analysis of structures is explained.<br />The main concepts and definitions related to dynamic analysis are explored such as the natural time periods, the natural frequencies and mode shapes.<br />The meaning of shear frames as used in dynamic analysis literature is explained and the difference between Single degree of Freedom and Multiple Degrees of Freedom Systems is shown.<br />The main methods used in Structural Dynamic analysis are briefly introduced such as the Time History Analysis and the Modal Analysis{% endraw %}
