{% raw %}Professional baker Bill Clark and home cook Daniel are swapping ingredients and hitting the kitchen to have a crack at each other's loaded waffle recipe. We set Daniel up with $112 worth of supplies - everything he’d need to make Bill’s marbled pumpernickel waffles with citrus-cured salmon and homemade cream cheese. Meanwhile, a more modest $14 worth of ingredients was sent back the other way for Bill to elevate into something gourmet. As is customary, food scientist Rose dialed in for a conference call to answer some questions Daniel had along the way. Alright, no more waffling: which one of these loaded waffles looks best to you?<br /><br /><br /><br />Chef Bill is on Instagram at @billclarkmakes<br /><br />Follow Daniel at @iamdanielvictor<br /><br />Keep up with Rose at @rosemarytrout_foodscience<br /><br />Still haven’t subscribed to Epicurious on YouTube? ►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/epiyoutubesub">http://bit.ly/epiyoutubesub</a><br /><br /><br /><br />ABOUT EPICURIOUS<br /><br />Browse thousands of recipes and videos from Bon Appétit, Gourmet, and more.
