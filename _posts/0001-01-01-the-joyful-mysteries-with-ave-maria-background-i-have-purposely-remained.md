{% raw %}I have purposely remained silent during the second half of the Our Father, the Hail Mary, the Glory Be and the Fatima Prayer (&quot;Oh my Jesus...&quot;), so please say the second half of these prayers as we pray the Rosary together. God bless.<br /><br />To say the same rosaries on my channel without ad interruptions, go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lbry.tv/@SatisCognitum:7?page=1&amp;order=new.">https://lbry.tv/@SatisCognitum:7?page=1&amp;order=new.</a>{% endraw %}
