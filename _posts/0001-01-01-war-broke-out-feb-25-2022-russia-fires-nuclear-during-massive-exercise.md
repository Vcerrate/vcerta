{% raw %}Russia fires nuclear during Massive Exercise Amid Ukraine Standoff.<br /><br />Russia announced massive nuclear drills while Western leaders grasped Friday for ways to avert a new war in Europe amid soaring East-West tensions, after unusually dire U.S. warnings that Moscow could order an invasion of Ukraine any day. <br /><br />Western officials, focused on an estimated 150,000 Russian troops posted around Ukraine's borders, fear the long-simmering conflict could provide the spark for a broader war. <br /><br />NATO allies are also flexing their might, beefing up military forces around eastern Europe, but insist the actions are purely defensive and to show unity in the face of Russian threats.{% endraw %}
