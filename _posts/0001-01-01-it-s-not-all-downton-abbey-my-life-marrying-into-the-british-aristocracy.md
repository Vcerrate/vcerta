{% raw %}Downton Abbey life? Think again. Since I married into the British Aristocracy, I've realised that the Downton Abbey 'life' doesn't exist anymore. So much has changed since the Second World War. <br /><br />In this video, I answer some of the questions you've asked in the comments on previous videos, such as when was the first time I wore a hat, my first 'bad' experience with table etiquette, how many historic homes were destroyed after the Second World War and where the Earl of Sandwich name originally came from.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this video, be sure to LIKE &amp; SUBSCRIBE!
