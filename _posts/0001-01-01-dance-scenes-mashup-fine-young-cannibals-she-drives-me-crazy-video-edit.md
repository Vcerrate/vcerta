Their 1988 album, The Raw &amp; the Cooked, topped the UK and US album charts, and contained their two Billboard Hot 100 number ones: &quot;She Drives Me Crazy&quot; and &quot;Good Thing&quot;.<br /><br />In 1990 the band won two Brit Awards: Best British Group, and Best British Album (for The Raw &amp; the Cooked). Their name came from the 1960 film All the Fine Young Cannibals starring Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood.<br /><br />&quot;She Drives Me Crazy&quot; is a song released in 1988 by English group Fine Young Cannibals, and included on their 1989 album The Raw &amp; the Cooked.
