And of course I love to challenge myself, so if you have an idea, let me know in the comments and I’ll give it a try!<br />I am an acrylic pouring addict, without a doubt. Playing with colors, testing out new fluid art techniques, brands, sizes &amp; collaborating with other abstract fluid artists; is the best. Since I started this journey I feel more balanced in my work and passion. If you see these fluid painting tutorials and feel like, this is something for me: go for it! The fun thing about fluid painting is, that even though you do exactly the same, the outcome is different everytime. Also everybody has a different view of composition, colorcombinations and the way of doing a technique, what makes and keeps it so interesting to watch. Thank you for watching and following me in my modern art journey! <br /><br />More about rinske douna: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rinskedouna.com/">https://rinskedouna.com/</a><br />Art for sale: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rinskedouna.com/shop/">https://rinskedouna.com/shop/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rinskedouna">https://www.instagram.com/rinskedouna</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/rinskedouna.art">https://www.facebook.com/rinskedouna.art</a><br />Amazon store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/rinskedouna">https://www.amazon.com/shop/rinskedouna</a><br />Merchandise: teespring.com/nl/stores/rinske-douna<br /><br />Rinske is an amazon  affiliate and receives a small commission on the sales at no extra cost for you!<br /><br />#acrylicpouring​​ #rinskedouna​ #acrylicpainting{% endraw %}
