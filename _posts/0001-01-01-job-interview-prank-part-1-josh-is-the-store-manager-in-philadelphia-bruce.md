{% raw %}***Josh is the store manager in Philadelphia. Bruce is one of the owners of Pets Plus and asked Josh to come to the Lansdale store to interview Teste. We were there an hour before setting up the cameras***<br /><br />Thanks to our friends at Pets Plus in Philadelphia who arranged this prank for us. The owners of Pet Plus set up an interview with Josh, one of the store managers. I posed as Always Teste for the interview and was accompanied by Jack Vale who posed as my parole officer. Jack will be uploading another interview we did with a different manager, so stay tuned to his channel as well:<br /><br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/jackvalefilms">http://www.youtube.com/jackvalefilms</a><br /><br /><br /><br />The new Ed Bassmaster Intro was designed by my friend Austin Ragno from Killer Kreations in South Philly.
