{% raw %}Western views and the legal system tend to view nature as property, and as a resource from which wealth is extracted, a commodity whose only value is to provide for human needs. But for millennia indigenous communities have viewed themselves as part of nature.<br /><br />As pressures on ecosystems mount and as conventional laws seem increasingly inadequate to address environmental degradation, communities, cities, regions and countries around the world are turning to a new legal strategy known as The Rights of Nature.<br /><br />This film takes viewers on a journey that explores the more recent origins of this legal concept, and its application and implementation in Ecuador, New Zealand, and the United States. Learn how constitutional reforms adopted in Ecuador have helped recognize nature as a legal entity, and how partnerships between the Māori and the government of New Zealand have led to personhood status for rivers, lakes and forests, and a renewed sense of balance between people and nature. See how the Rights of Nature function in the urban setting of Santa Monica, California.<br /><br />The film explores the successes and challenges inherent in creating new legal structures that have the potential to maintain and restore ecosystems while achieving a balance between humans and nature.<br /><br />Original Premiere at DOK.fest Munich, Germany<br /><br />Additional Screenings<br />Rachel Carlson Center (Germany) <br />DOKfest Munich (Germany)<br />International Earth Trusteeship Gathering (Netherlands)<br />International Symposium on the Rights of Nature (Ecuador)<br />FICMA Barcelona Film Festival (Spain)<br />Envirofilm Bratislava (Slovak Republic)<br />Reel Earth Film Festival (New Zealand)<br />FICMA Montevideo (Uruguay) <br />DOCUTAH (United States)<br /><br />Producers: Issac Goeckeritz, Hal Crimmel, María Valeria Berros<br />Writer: Hal Crimmel<br />Narrator: Shawn Murdock<br />Editor / Camera: Issac Goeckeritz<br />Audio Post Engineer: Gerald Hartly{% endraw %}
