{% raw %}Did you spot this in Turning Red? These are some of the hardest to spot easter eggs in the whole movie! Pixar includes a reference in all of their films to A113, which is the number of a room at the California Institute of the Arts where many of their animators went to school. Turning Red has not one, but two incredibly hard to spot instances of this easter egg, the first being on the line chalker Dad is pushing during the ritual, and the second coming after the credits, when we see a pair of 4 Town tickets that also have an A113 reference on them.<br /><br />#movielogic #moviedetails #turningred{% endraw %}
