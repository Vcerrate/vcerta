{% raw %}Prehistoric creatures have been spotted all around the world, from the loch ness monster, to the megalodon shark, and giant snakes, to dire wolves chasing regular wolves - wait t'ill you see this! <br /><br />Subscribe for more amazing videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest</a> ◄<br /><br />Video footage credit: <br />Steve Williams<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq7IOfk6qfQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq7IOfk6qfQ</a><br /><br /> <br />We would never want to share our planet with some of the fierce prehistoric predators that used to walk-- or swim-- the earth. From the giant megalodon shark that used to lurk in the oceans to the terrifying titanoboa snake that could be more than 40 feet long. But not all evidence suggests that these mysterious creatures are actually gone. Dinosaurs could still walk among us. Maybe they’re just really good at hiding. <br /><br />There have been sightings all over the world of strange, unexplainable creatures. From giant direwolves to land-sloths the size of elephants. There are tales of sea monsters like the Loch Ness monster and of giants like bigfoot, who could really just be the mysterious prehistoric great-ape gigantopithecus. We’ve found evidence that we were off by hundreds of thousands of years about when some of these creatures went extinct, like the saber-toothed tiger and the giant birds called teratorns. So couldn’t that mean we’re wrong about them going extinct at all? <br /><br />We’ve dug up some of the most prominent legends, sightings, and evidence that suggest that these prehistoric creatures are still alive and well-- and that they’re just hiding in their own elusive parts of our world. From tales passed down through generations to unexplainable footprints, here are all the reasons these “extinct” creatures could still be out there today.  <br /><br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com{% endraw %}
