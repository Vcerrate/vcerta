{% raw %}Welcome to Earth Relaxation !<br />New Zealand, MƒÅori Aotearoa, island country in the South Pacific Ocean, the southwesternmost part of Polynesia. New Zealand is a remote, mountainous group of islands in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. The two main islands, North and South Islands, are separated by the Cook Strait. Although New Zealand is small, its geologic history is complex. The islands were created just 23 million years ago when land was thrust out of the ocean by volcanic forces. New Zealand has more than 50 volcanoes, some of which are still active today. The mountainous country of both islands is cut by many rivers, which are swift, unnavigable, and obstructive to communication. The longest is the Waikato, in the North Island, and the swiftest is the Clutha/Mata-Au, in the South. New Zealand‚Äôs climate is determined by its latitude, its isolation, and its physical characteristics. There are few temperature extremes.<br />Music has so many benefits, and one of them is that it calms your nerves down. It's always a good idea to listen to some background music while you're doing something.
