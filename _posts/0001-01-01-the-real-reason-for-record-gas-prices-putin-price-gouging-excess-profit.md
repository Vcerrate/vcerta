{% raw %}Putin! Price gouging! Excess profit!<br /><br />Politicians blame the wrong things for record gas prices.<br /><br />--------<br />Don't miss a single video from Stossel TV.

Companies are always greedy. They were just as greedy when prices dropped.<br /><br />“If big oil could raise prices anytime they wanted … then why were they so cheap in 2020?” asks Ben Lieberman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.<br /><br />He points out that the record price “all comes down to cutting back on supplies.”<br /><br />Exactly. Prices change because of supply and demand. Politicians, pushed by environmental activists, have restricted oil production.{% endraw %}
