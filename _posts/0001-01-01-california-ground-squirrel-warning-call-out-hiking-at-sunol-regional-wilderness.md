{% raw %}Out hiking at Sunol Regional Wilderness, I came across an area full of California ground squirrels. Apparently they didn't like my presence very much, because they issued some warning calls and went on &quot;high alert.&quot; Although they didn't immediately dive into their burrows. Anyway, you can see and hear their response in this video.{% endraw %}
