{% raw %}Hello Everyone! <br /><br />This week I decided to create a video about five ways to help you feel more youthful during (and after) your transition to grey hair. Let me tell you, feeling good on the inside is number one when it comes to looking and feeling youthful, but tweaking our beauty routines can help us feel more confident and vibrant. Silver or grey hair can sometimes wash us out, especially those of us with lighter complexions, so the right make-up and clothing can make a world of difference. <br /><br />I hope you enjoy this video. Please see the links below for all of the products mentioned in the video that I personally use and endorse. Do you have a different way to feel/look more confident then one of the ones mentioned in the video? If so, please let me know in the comment section below. <br /><br />Have a great week! <br /><br />Yours in Health and Happiness, <br />Erica xo<br />********************************************************************* <br />Intro Song: Emily Klassen. &quot;Today's the Day.&quot; Shutterstock Music.<br /><br />Video Links: <br />My Blow-Dry Party: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/maktgq9HhFM">https://youtu.be/maktgq9HhFM</a><br />Grey Hair and the Sun: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/o9H9k66ze3g">https://youtu.be/o9H9k66ze3g</a><br /><br />Make-up and Hair Products: <br /><br />**In the video I recommend John Frieda Frizz-Ease Thermal Protection but it seems to have been replaced with John Frieda Frizz-Ease Expert Finish Polish.
