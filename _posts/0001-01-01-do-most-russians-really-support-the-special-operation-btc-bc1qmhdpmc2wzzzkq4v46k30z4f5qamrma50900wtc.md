{% raw %}BTC: bc1qmhdpmc2wzzzkq4v46k30z4f5qamrma50900wtc<br />ETH/BSC: 0x0fDBC92B5285e1e1694C64C6a9bB63567e7B2aE5<br />My Telegram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/roman_nfkrz">https://t.me/roman_nfkrz</a><br />A lot of people online like to say that most Russian citizens actually support what's currently going on in Ukraine. And technically, according to the governmental polls in Russia, that is true: over 70% of Russians are supporting the &quot;special military operation&quot;, and Putin's approval rate is at 83%. But are these stats actually real and can we fully believe them? I don't think it's that simple.
