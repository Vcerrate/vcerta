{% raw %}In this video is about the lower erosion of Petra, the ancient rock hewn city. This marvelous creation contains over 800 sandstone caves. While looking at photos of Petra’s beautiful facades, we notice many caves’ lower portions are more damaged and sometimes we see a horizontal rock layer has been stripped off. Why are these monuments more eroded on the bottom than on top?  Some have proposed that the severe lower erosions we see at Petra were caused by floods. Petra is in a semi-arid and mountainous region, and it is susceptible to flash floods like most dry areas. But are flash floods really the cause of the lower erosions of the caves? After researching and reading several scientific papers, I’ve come to the conclusion that floods are unlikely to be the main factor of this curious lower erosion of the rock structures. The real culprit is something or someone else. <br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/curiousbeing">https://www.patreon.com/curiousbeing</a><br />Instagram: instagram.com/curiousbeingtina<br /><br />References:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.geotimes.org/june04/feature_petra.html">http://www.geotimes.org/june04/feature_petra.html</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.khammash.com/research/petra-iron-and-manganese">https://www.khammash.com/research/petra-iron-and-manganese</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Analysis-of-sandstone-weathering-of-the-Roman-in-Paradise/79fe4d4c5886adf9a3c2dee1a0c24f3523aca301">https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Analysis-of-sandstone-weathering-of-the-Roman-in-Paradise/79fe4d4c5886adf9a3c2dee1a0c24f3523aca301</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/books/book/538/chapter/3801738/Petra-revisited-An-examination-of-sandstone?redirectedFrom=PDF">https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/books/book/538/chapter/3801738/Petra-revisited-An-examination-of-sandstone?redirectedFrom=PDF</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290708116_Slope_dynamics_monitoring_and_geological_conservation_of_the_Siq_of_Petra_Jordan">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290708116_Slope_dynamics_monitoring_and_geological_conservation_of_the_Siq_of_Petra_Jordan</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327721313_The_Protection_of_Petra_from_Flash_Floods">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327721313_The_Protection_of_Petra_from_Flash_Floods</a><br /><br />This is my YouTube Channel “Curious Being.”  I have many diverse and interesting topics to share, such as Lost Ancient Human Civilizations, Megalithic Sites, and other related fascinating studies.
