{% raw %}BRILLIANT CAMPING TRICKS YOU SHOULD TRY ON YOUR NEXT TRIP<br /><br /><br /><br />In this video, I show you some incredible camping ideas that will improve your time during your next adventure. <br /><br />You can make your own little tent using a large rope and a bedding sheet. Simply hang the rope from one tree all the way to the other side, then add the sheet on top and secure it on the ground with some heavy rocks. <br /><br />If the ground is damp, you can make your own hammock using a bedding sheet, and some ropes. <br /><br />I also show you how to make your own water filter using three layers of fabric. First, add some coal on top, then some grass in the middle, and finally some sand at the bottom. Then boil it over some fire to get rid of all the bacteria and voila.<br /><br />If your shoes got wet, simply put them in a cooking pan with some rocks and bring them to boil. Then remove the rocks, place them in your shoes and they’ll dry in no time. <br /><br /><br /><br />Timestamps:<br /><br />0:36 – DIY hammock<br /><br />1:24 – DIY water filter <br /><br />2:21 – Awesome tricks with matches <br /><br />4:14 – How to dry your socks really fast<br /><br />7:02 – How to simplify your camping trip<br /><br />8:52 – DIY tricks using plastic bottles<br /><br />12:36 – DIY toilet paper dispenser <br /><br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
