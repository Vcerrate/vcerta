{% raw %}Twist the grip to train the wrist and master club face control.<br /><br />This is why your golf is not improving!<br /><br />So you want to know why you never *really* improve? You want to know what stops you from playing better golf - the golf you‚Äôve always dreamed of playing.<br /><br />Club face control.<br /><br />When it comes to the golf swing, CLUB FACE is KING üëë. Where the club face points at impact will dictate the primary starting direction of the ball. If that club face is not orientated correctly, the rest of the swing (and your body) will make compensatory moves to try and ‚Äúsquare‚Äù the club face to help you hit a straighter shot.<br /><br />The wrists control the club face and how you grip the club and move your wrists matters as much as anything else you do in the swing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the wrist movement is complex, and golfers learn to move their wrists in ways that are detrimental to their performance. The problem is, they DON‚ÄôT KNOW they‚Äôre doing it wrong! They assume that the way they move their wrists is correct, because it FEELS natural. When asked to change their wrist movement, it often feels extreme and sometime uncomfortable. However, unless you fix the wrists and club face permanently, you will ALWAYS revert back to your old pattern and habits leading to poor ball striking and wayward shots!<br /><br />The HACKMOTION wrists sensor allows you to MEASURE exactly how your wrists are moving (and believe me, they are moving A LOT!) throughout the swing and accurately pinpoint the area where you need to practice. You can only manage what you measure. If you know what is wrong, you can work on it and make improvements. Without good feedback, you are likely just whacking 100‚Äôs of balls at the driving range ingraining a poor pattern and solidifying those bad habits.<br /><br />I will show you the common mistakes golfers make when it comes to the wrist movements in the golf swing. I will also show you how HACKMOTION can measure those movements and begin to help you train a more efficient pattern that will improve your club face control, which will ultimately improve you ball striking &amp; accuracy - making you a better golfer!<br /><br />üì¶ LEARN MORE ABOUT HACKMOTION HERE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hackmotion.com">https://hackmotion.com</a><br />Use code &quot;GRIDLIFE&quot; to get FREE SHIPPING WORLDWIDE üåç <br /><br />üé• Watch more HACKMOTION videos on this PLAYLIST - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKCOOPZaPE20ENhiovRhVA69bxzkcM0r1">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKCOOPZaPE20ENhiovRhVA69bxzkcM0r1</a><br /><br />***GET 15% OFF THE HANGER from WATSON GOLF using CODE: GRIDLIFE *** <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hangergolf.com?sca_ref=1238925.SgEjyMtWLV">https://www.hangergolf.com?sca_ref=1238925.SgEjyMtWLV</a><br /><br />üé• OTHER WRIST VIDEOS CAN BE FOUND BELOW...<br />MASTER THE WRISTS - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/gFU21qshmzo">https://youtu.be/gFU21qshmzo</a><br />HOW THE WRISTS WORK - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/x7sshGiStaA">https://youtu.be/x7sshGiStaA</a><br />HIT HARD, STOP QUICK - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/BelbBH5NkKQ">https://youtu.be/BelbBH5NkKQ</a><br /><br />#golftec‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã #hackmotion‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã #stackandtilt{% endraw %}
