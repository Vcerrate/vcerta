{% raw %}My previous video for leveling right here covers most all of what you need.<br /><br />Reach Max Power Level Fast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/aQ9oWhXd0is">https://youtu.be/aQ9oWhXd0is</a><br /><br />The updated information we got from the recent TWAB tells us if you do ALL the campaign missions on Legend Difficulty you will get a set of blue (rare) gear at 1520 and 8 upgrade modules which you can infuse into some decent gear you already have and get a HUGE head start on the Powerful and Pinnacle grind that starts after you hit 1500. Even if you get to the soft cap of 1500 before you finish all the missions, I still recommend doing those first so you can make that huge jump in power. <br /><br />If you enjoyed the video, likes are appreciated.  Other than that, good luck out there and have fun. <br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks and helps support me if you like:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9xJ-_kYMxVGHuL5hG3iJyg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9xJ-_kYMxVGHuL5hG3iJyg/join</a><br /><br />I am sponsored by Advancedgg and you can use code “Ebontis” for 10% at <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://advanced.gg/?ref=Ebontis">https://advanced.gg/?ref=Ebontis</a><br /><br />EPIC Creator Code: Ebontis<br /><br />ElGato - it’s how I manage my stream and nearly all my content creation:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://e.lga.to/ebontis/">http://e.lga.to/ebontis/</a>   <br /><br /><br />Looking for 10% off at KontrolFreek.com, use code “Ebontis”, click here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kontrolfreek.pxf.io/c/410189/367518/5408">https://kontrolfreek.pxf.io/c/410189/367518/5408</a><br /><br /><br />You can also find me at:<br />Twitch – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/ebontis">https://www.twitch.tv/ebontis</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Ebontis">https://twitter.com/Ebontis</a><br />You can support me at:<br />Patreon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Ebontis">https://www.patreon.com/Ebontis</a><br /><br />Subscribe to my channel here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9xJ-_kYMxVGHuL5hG3iJyg?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9xJ-_kYMxVGHuL5hG3iJyg?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />PS4 = Ebontis<br />XB1 = Ebontis<br />Steam = Ebontis (look for the cheetah)<br /><br />If interested in my discord let me know as well.<br /><br />Ebontis, Destiny 2, Xur, Nightfall, Shattered Throne, Destiny 2 Shadowkeep, Armor 2.0, Where is Xur, Nightfall Solo, Guide, Walkthrough, Hunter, Warlock, Titan, Beyond Light, Stasis, Shadebinder, Behemoth, Revenant, Season of the Chosen, Battlegrounds, Cabal Gold, Max Level, Powerful Gear, Pinnacle Gear, Hammer of Proving, Cabal Champions, Caiatl, Season 13, Ticuu’s Divination, Bell of Conquests, Umbral Engrams, Focused Engrams, Hammer Charge, Prismatic Recaster, Umbral Decoder, Presage, Dead Man’s Tale, Season of the Splicer, Override, Splicer Gauntlet, Encrypted Data, Expunge, Mithrax, <br /><br />Destiny 2, Season of the Lost, Dreaming City, Spine of Keres, Divilian Mists, Atlas Skews, Tracing the Stars, Divilian-Rheasilvia Path, Lower Cliffside, Divilian-Cimmerian Path, Central Cave, Drowned Bay Alcove, Spine Oracle Orrery, Distant Spine Island, Destiny 2, Ascendant Anchor Locations, Ascendant Anchor, Ascendant Ballast 1,Patrol Ascendant Anchors, Shattered Realm Ascendant Anchors, Forest of Echos, Wayfinders Compass Calibration level, Shattered Realm<br /><br />30th Anniversary, Grasp of Avarice, Dares of Eternity, Starhorse, Xur, Solo Flawless Grasp of Avarice, Gjallarhorn, Forerunner{% endraw %}
