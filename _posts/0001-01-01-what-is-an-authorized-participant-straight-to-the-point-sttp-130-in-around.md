Meaning, that when there is a shortage of ETF shares in the market, authorized participants create more. <br /><br />And the opposite is true. Authorized participants will reduce ETF shares in circulation when the price of the ETF is lower than the price of the underlying shares. <br /><br />Traditionally, authorized participants are market makers or any other large institutional investors. Specifically, they can be large banks, such as JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, or Morgan Stanley. <br /><br />If you find my content interesting, please consider subscribing to my channel.
