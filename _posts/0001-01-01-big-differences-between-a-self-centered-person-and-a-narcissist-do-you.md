There are big differences, and they are important.<br /><br />Let me help you understand, so you can recognize who you're dealing with when the tell-tale behaviors rear their head. <br /><br />It's a very significant distinction, and you need different skills and strategies for dealing with each of them. <br /><br />* * Remember, narcissists and other toxic people come in all genders and ages * * <br />and toxic relationships can be at home, at work, at play... with your parent, boss, spouse, sibling, friend, co-worker. <br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />I am Dr. Rhoberta Shaler, The Relationship Help Doctor.<br />Are you in relationship with a Hijackal?
