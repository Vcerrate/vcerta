{% raw %}#bengaljukebox<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />To mark the 150th birth anniversary of renowned poet-lyricist-musician-playwright Dwijendralal Roy (D L Roy), Bengal Foundation arranged a two-day music festival in collaboration with the Sri Aurobindo Institute of Culture (Kolkata), on September 6-7, 2013, at the Bangladesh National Museum, Dhaka. <br /><br />We are pleased to bring to you the song &quot;Bolo go sajani&quot;, composed by Atulprasad Sen, which was presented at the festival by Swastika Mukhopadhyay. The artist was accompanied on stage by Enamul Haque Omar on the Tabla, Almas Ali on the Violin,  Najmul Alam on the Mandira and Daulatur Rahman on the Keyboard. <br /><br /><br />Atulprasad Sen is remembered today for his songs, known as Atul Prasader Gaan, a body of devotional, patriotic or intensely romantic songs written and set to music by him. The small number of his compositions – just over 200 – are powerful in their pathos, sense of loss, and communion with nature. They occupy a special place in the hearts of Bengalis. Sen was also a dedicated social worker, a very successful barrister, an endearing man, and, in his quiet way, a rebel.<br /><br />Sen was close to Rabindranath Tagore. He was a lawyer by day, but would be immersed in music by evening. He brought to Bengali music a tantalising new element: the use of thumri. He also pioneered the ghazal style in Bengali music. <br /><br />Born in 1871 in Faridpur district, in Bangladesh, Sen was brought up by his maternal grandfather Kalinarayan Gupta, a noted Brahmo Samaj reformer who was also a kirtan singer. The family’s cultural leanings and their faith, nourished in Sen a sense of deep spirituality. Coupled with the tribulations he suffered in his personal life, Sen’s musical outpourings became deeply soulful and pathos-filled.  <br /><br /><br /><br />About Swastika Mukhopadhyay-<br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.visvabharati.ac.in/SwastikaMukhopadhyay.html">https://www.visvabharati.ac.in/SwastikaMukhopadhyay.html</a><br /><br /><br />=============================<br /><br />Bengal Foundation has been promoting Bengali music for decades in order to nurture and uphold the musical traditions of Bengal.
