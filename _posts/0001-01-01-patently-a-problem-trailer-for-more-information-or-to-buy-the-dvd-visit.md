Now, we hoped, the genes responsible for diseases such as cystic fibrosis or breast cancer could be identified and treated. But advances could be severely hampered by the controversial patenting of 95% of human genes. With one company effectively ‘owning’ rights into genetic research on these genes, many companies simply cannot afford to continue. This slick and visual film is part of the ABC Australia world-renowned 4 Corners strand.<br /><br />ABC Australia - Ref 1946<br /><br />Every week Journeyman offers a brand new documentary, fresh out of the cutting room.
