{% raw %}Skyrim is a classical RPG game which practically everyone has played in there life. This is partly due to the fact that they managed to port it onto PC, Xbox, playstation, switch and Samsung smart fridge. The list goes on. Anyway today we are discovering that skyrim is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits well excluding the wooden sword and reanu keeves. Today however we investigate how effective going into vanilla skyrim anniversary edition and beating the game using only exploits as we intend to beat skyrim at level 1 thats right its a can you beat skyrim level 1 only challenge where I am not allowed to gain a single bit of experience. So today I chose to revisit the game and ask the question. What if you couldnt use any weapons armour or magic and Can you beat skyrim with a unarmed build in one hit because you are wearing 1000 sets of rings? These are the important questions which have gone unanswered for too long! So yes today we are going to break the game without the power of enchanted forks and overpowered armour and instead use our bare hands as we beat skyrim without levelling up!<br /><br />This Challenge was in large part influenced by the majestic @ymfah and his amazing How To Beat Skyrim Level 1 challenge: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6msg3s4Y8Z8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6msg3s4Y8Z8</a><br /><br />What you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. <br /><br />So sit back relax and enjoy this skyrim challenge!
