I will take this story from here.<br />yeah, this clip has been circulating a little bit and vice wrote it up here. Some cops busted into this 16-year-old trans girl's room. She was doing a twitch stream Minecraft twitch stream. We have some footage of it. and then I'll give you some background on the story from the vice write-up.<br />oh god, thank you for the follow future roll call or Khloe Chloe yeah. okay well, now there's an officer in here just trying to join the stream. okay so basically now we just have to get back to the little base area so we can like get the and stuff and I guess we're just gonna have officers sitting in on the stream. Hey, pizza roll Chloe. nice seeing you here for the first time.{% endraw %}
