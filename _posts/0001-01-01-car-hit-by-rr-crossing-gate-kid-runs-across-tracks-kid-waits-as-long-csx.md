{% raw %}Railroad Crossing Gate Hits Top Of Car That Almost Ran The Crossing!  2 Kids Were About To Cross The Railroad Crossing And One Went Across With A Huge Train Coming &amp; 1 Kid Waited.   This CSX auto racks train is in Hamilton, Ohio next to the abandoned paper mill buildings and abandoned railroad siding.  I heard a Big Bang and turned my camera to see a car with a crossing bar on top of it.  The driver pulled forward and then backed up while trying to figure out what to do.  At the same time the 2 kids were trying to figure out if they should cross the tracks or wait for the train.  The train was southbound heading to Queensgate Yard in Cincinnati.  Should the car have gone ahead and crossed the tracks instead of stopping and getting hit by the gate?  A Railfan would have stopped before the gates came down.  Lol.  Should the kids have waited for the train or just go ahead and hurry over the tracks?  Leave a comment below.  There is always something interesting going on in Hamilton.  I hope you saw my recent video of the train that hit a railroad crossing gate near the old train station.  I also have videos of cars going around the gates including a police car.  CSX, Norfolk Southern and Amtrak pass through Hamilton although Amtrak wyes off near the train station and doesn't pass these old dilapidated buildings.  I almost forgot, I was filming a train going by these buildings a couple months ago when one of them caught on fire and the fire department came while I was filming.  Hamilton is a city with a population of 63,399 and is between Dayton and Cincinnati.  Always something here.  Filmed April 7, 2022.<br />      Thanks for watching!
