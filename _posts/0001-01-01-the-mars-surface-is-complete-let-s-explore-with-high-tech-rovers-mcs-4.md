{% raw %}Welcome to another episode of Scrap Mechanic Mars Colony Survival! Today I am reviewing some of Mars tiles submitted to the new community series!  With around 300 submissions, I have selected around 75 of my favorites and compiled them all together in a single world as a showcase of the amazing work the community has done.  This is just a showcase world and all tiles seen are just temporary.  The final world will not include everything seen here, and the layout will be completely different.<br /><br />Full Mars Colony Survival Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b9zZCSR0Cs&amp;list=PLjtiR7dM6LgpAN05_oN1hGHh7aq8qDiFR">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b9zZCSR0Cs&amp;list=PLjtiR7dM6LgpAN05_oN1hGHh7aq8qDiFR</a><br /><br />Download the tiles: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791414470">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791414470</a><br /><br />Join the discord to submit workshop items: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/ScrapMan">https://discord.gg/ScrapMan</a><br /><br />My Most Popular Videos (for whatever reason): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjtiR7dM6Lgrq8bJywkgM8QFsSgeQaWEI">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjtiR7dM6Lgrq8bJywkgM8QFsSgeQaWEI</a><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />♦ Join the Scrapper Community: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/ScrapMan">https://discord.gg/ScrapMan</a><br />♦ Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://scrapman.store">https://scrapman.store</a><br />♦ Like my Tweets: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ScrapManYT">https://twitter.com/ScrapManYT</a><br />♦ My Doggos on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/scrap.dogs">https://www.instagram.com/scrap.dogs</a><br />♦ My Youtuber Setup: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/scrapman">https://www.amazon.com/shop/scrapman</a><br />♦ I Make Metal Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Catarinth">https://www.youtube.com/c/Catarinth</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />If you want to see MORE Scrap Mechanic videos, please like and subscribe!
