I hope you enjoy!<br />#caseywhite #vickywhite #caseywhiteupdate #vickywhiteupdate #evansville<br /><br />An escaped Alabama inmate and a former corrections officer who aided his getaway hid out for days before a tip from a car wash led to their capture, the sheriff said Tuesday.<br /><br />Former corrections officer Vicky White, 56, shot herself in the head and died, and inmate Casey White, 38, surrendered after authorities briefly chased the couple Monday afternoon, ending a multistate search that began when the pair fled from an Alabama jail last month. <br /><br />Casey White signed an extradition waiver, and sheriff's deputies from Alabama were arranging to pick him up in Indiana, Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding said Tuesday. Wedding said White wouldn't be charged in Indiana, facing more serious charges in Alabama.<br /><br />Police said Vicky White and Casey White, who are not related, had a &quot;jailhouse romance,&quot; but there were few clues as to why Vicky helped the man facing a murder charge and serving a 75-year jail sentence on other violent offenses.<br /><br />Over the weekend, law enforcement officials around Evansville, Indiana, put together the pieces that the pair might be in the area,  Wedding said.<br /><br />Casey White told investigators he and Vicky stopped in Evansville to &quot;get their bearings straight and then figure out their next place to travel,&quot; Wedding said. They booked a hotel room for two weeks in the area, Wedding said. Authorities said they have surveillance video from a car wash where the fugitives switched vehicles. <br /><br />Members of a fugitive task force pursued the two Monday afternoon after they were spotted leaving their hotel, Wedding said.<br /><br />Police rammed the pair's car and flipped it, and Vicky White shot herself in the head, Wedding said. The Vanderburgh County Coroner ruled her death a suicide following an autopsy Tuesday. Casey White told detectives he was armed with several firearms and intended to start shooting during the chase, but his car being flipped prevented him, Wedding said.<br /><br />Members of a fugitive task force pursued the two Monday afternoon after they were spotted leaving their hotel, Wedding said.<br /><br />Police rammed the pair's car and flipped it, and Vicky White shot herself in the head, Wedding said.
