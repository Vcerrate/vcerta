{% raw %}In this free English class I'll help you learn how to talk about your daily routine. It's always a good idea to be able to describe your day in English, from the time you wake up, until the time you fall asleep! This free English class will help you do just that!<br /><br />In this lesson you'll learn words and phrases like: to wake up, to get up, to make lunch, to go to bed, to take a shower, to pack a lunch, to fall asleep and more!<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this English lesson about daily routines!<br /><br />--<br /><br />‚åõ Remember:  Always watch the video three times.  Twice today with English subtitles on, and once tomorrow with the English subtitles off.
