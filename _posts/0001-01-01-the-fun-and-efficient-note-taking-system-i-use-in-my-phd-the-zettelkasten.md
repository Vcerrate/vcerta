{% raw %}The Zettelkasten method of note-taking and knowledge management changed my life and saved my PhD! Originally used by Niklas Luhmann, a German sociologist who wrote hundreds of articles and over 70 books in his lifetime, &quot;zettelkasten&quot; means &quot;slip box&quot; because Luhmann's system was in a literal slip box filled with note cards. I host mine, though, in a program called Obsidian (link below). If my overview of this method got you intrigued, here are some other resources to check out that go into more detail:<br /><br />The best book length overview of the zettelkasten system is &quot;How to Take Smart Notes&quot; by Sonke Ahrens. I find it useful for getting inspiration and there's an audiobook, too, if you just need a refresher/some motivation:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://takesmartnotes.com/">https://takesmartnotes.com/</a><br /><br />By far the resource I return to the most is a post by Sascha on the Zettelkasten website called &quot;Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method.&quot; I also just surf that website whenever I run into an issue with my own zettelkasten, because 100% someone has answered my question there: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/">https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/</a><br /><br />Obsidian has a VERY useful &quot;help&quot; section once you download it. It's definitely worth checking out: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://obsidian.md/">https://obsidian.md/</a><br /><br />Other software people use for a zettelkastem, other than Obsidian or a literal slipbox, are Notion (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.notion.so/desktop),">https://www.notion.so/desktop),</a> Foam (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/),">https://foambubble.github.io/foam/),</a> and Roam (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://roamresearch.com/).">https://roamresearch.com/).</a><br /><br />There are so many YouTubers talking about zettelkasten and Obsidian!!
