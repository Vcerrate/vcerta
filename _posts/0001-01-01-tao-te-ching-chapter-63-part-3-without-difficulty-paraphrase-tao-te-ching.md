{% raw %}Tao Te Ching, Chapter 63 Paraphrase by Derek Lin<br /><br />We paraphrase a chapter to demonstrate a complete understanding of the chapter by expressing the original meaning in our own words.<br /><br />Chapter 63 - Without Difficulty (無難章):<br /><br />To live in the Tao is to live without attachments — taking actions without overdoing anything; managing matters without interfering with others; savoring the flavor of life without losing oneself in the process. Whether the matter is big or small, to many or a few, we are detached from having to “get even” with anyone, so we respond in a positive way, even when others direct negativity at us. <br /><br />We are also detached from the egocentric need to appear heroic. Rather than to attempt a difficult feat, we can start with something simple; rather than to create something big, we can start with something small. This makes practical sense, because even the most difficult task can be broken down into easier steps, and even the grandest achievements must be composed of smaller details. With the easy and small tasks, we get going quickly, accumulate experience, build momentum, and enjoy the process. <br /><br />This approach is in accordance with the Tao. By focusing on the small, sages end up accomplishing great things. They apply the same principle consistently, so they never promise anything lightly and set unrealistic expectations. They know people who underestimate the effort, often encounter numerous difficulties. They learn from this and take the opposite approach. They prepare for potentially difficult tasks, and end up completing it with less effort. This is their “secret” for living the easy life.<br /><br />———————————————————<br />“Tao Te Ching” by Derek Lin. SkyLight Paths Publishing, 2008-10-22.
