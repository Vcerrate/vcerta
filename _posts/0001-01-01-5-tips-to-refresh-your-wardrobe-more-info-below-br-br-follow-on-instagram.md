We are incredibly proud of all our brand partnership content and it will always be disclaimed in the most transparent way possible so you know exactly what is and 'AD'.<br />Because we don't work with a large amount of brands on sponsored content we do rely on our YouTube ad revenue. Any adverts you watch during the duration of our videos will earn us a small percentage of 'ad revenue' from YouTube and we really appreciate you watching the adverts in full (and not skipping them), but only if and when you can. We also know that time is precious so no pressure.<br />We also use 'Affiliate Links' in the description boxes below our videos and if you make a purchase via these links we will earn a small percentage of commission depending on the sale amount. Not all links are affiliate links but just assume they are<br />Any items/links marked with '[AD - Pr products]' are products which have been 'gifted' from the respective brands without a contract for sponsored content. This is still classed as a form of advertising because nothing is ever &quot;free&quot;, brands are gaining exposure to our audience by us featuring them, so these items are marked as 'AD-Pr product' in the description box but we are under no obligation to feature these items. And as with our paid content, we never accept gifting/pr products from brands that we don't already or wouldn't spend our money on. If we have received a press discount on anything featured this will also be disclaimed.<br /><br />‚≠êÔ∏èITEMS FEATURED IN THIS VIDEO‚≠êÔ∏è<br /><br />‚óæÔ∏èWHAT I WAS WEARING‚óæÔ∏è<br />[AD - Pr product] Black Jumper <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apprl.com/al/6wLl/">https://apprl.com/al/6wLl/</a><br />[AD - Pr products] Jewellery <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mejurifinecrew.sjv.io/5bnKW9">https://mejurifinecrew.sjv.io/5bnKW9</a><br /><br />‚óæÔ∏èUSEFUL LINKS‚óæÔ∏è<br />Cashmere Comb <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3fKReDl">https://amzn.to/3fKReDl</a><br />De-Bobbler <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apprl.com/al/7Qah/">https://apprl.com/al/7Qah/</a><br /><br />‚óæÔ∏èRELATED VIDEOS‚óæÔ∏è<br />MOVING IN AND ORGANISING MY WARDROBE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/bpfzNhIADg4">https://youtu.be/bpfzNhIADg4</a><br />BUILDING MY WALK IN WARDROBE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/3S59TfNeiSs">https://youtu.be/3S59TfNeiSs</a><br />ESSENTIAL 10-ITEM WARDROBE CARE KIT <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/JCqvQYk13R0">https://youtu.be/JCqvQYk13R0</a><br /><br /><br />Editing by Simon ‚ù§Ô∏è{% endraw %}
