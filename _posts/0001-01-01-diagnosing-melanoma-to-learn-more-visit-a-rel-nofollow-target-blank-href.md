It explains skin examination, skin biopsy methods (punch biopsy, excisional biopsy) lymph node biopsy methods (fine needle aspiration biopsy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, excisional lymph node biopsy), and imaging tests (MRI, CT scan, PET scan, ultrasound). This animation also provides an overview of how melanoma is staged (how far the cancer has spread). Knowing the stage helps doctors decide how to best treat your melanoma and predict your prognosis, or outlook.{% endraw %}
