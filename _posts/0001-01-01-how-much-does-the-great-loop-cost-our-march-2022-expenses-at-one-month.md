{% raw %}It's time to share how much the Great Loop is costing us! It is a question we wanted to know when we started out, so when we kicked off the Loop in Key West we recorded every expense. We share the total march expense as well as our feelings from one month on the Loop for our second attempt!<br /><br />Great Loop Expenses for March: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://schoandjo.com/monthly-expenses-on-americas-great-loop-march-2022/">https://schoandjo.com/monthly-expenses-on-americas-great-loop-march-2022/</a><br />How we Cruise on America's Great Loop with Ollie: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://schoandjo.com/full-time-cruising-with-a-dog-on-americas-great-loop/">https://schoandjo.com/full-time-cruising-with-a-dog-on-americas-great-loop/</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching! <br /><br />Cheers from the Loop,<br />Jennifer and Elliot<br /><br />#greatloop #boatlife #greatloopbudget<br /><br />üé• Episode #228 | Filmed on April 8th, 2022<br />üá∫üá∏ America's Great Loop | Beaufort, South Carolina<br />_______________________<br />BLOG<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://schoandjo.com/blog">https://schoandjo.com/blog</a><br />‚òùÔ∏è Read more and check out behind the scenes at the blog<br />_______________________<br />SUNDAY SUMMARY<br />We send out a weekly email with our travel updates <br />üìß - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://schoandjo.com/sundaysummary/">https://schoandjo.com/sundaysummary/</a><br />_______________________<br />SUPPORT<br />Free and Paid ways to help support our channel<br />üôè - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://schoandjo.com/say-thanks/">https://schoandjo.com/say-thanks/</a><br />_______________________<br />GEAR<br />From camera gear to travel, boating, and hiking must-haves, it's all here<br />üì∑ - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://schoandjo.com/gear/">https://schoandjo.com/gear/</a><br />_______________________<br />CHAPTERS<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:11 Cheers!<br />00:28 Our Great Loop Story<br />00:41 Why we are sharing expenses<br />01:14 Where to find more detail<br />01:53 Total March Expense<br />02:10 Nights at Anchor vs Marina<br />02:24 Biggest Expense<br />02:55 Second Biggest Expense<br />03:33 One Month on the Great Loop<br />04:00 What makes this loop different than last year<br />06:09 What has been your favorite Moment so far<br />07:43 What is one thing you would like to change going forward<br />09:19 Closing thoughts and Dog Blog<br />10:14 Bloops<br />_______________________<br />MUSIC<br />We get our music and sound effects from Musicbed and Epidemic Sound<br /><br />Epidemic Sound 30-day free trial here:<br />üéß - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/sj-epidemic">https://bit.ly/sj-epidemic</a><br />________________<br />FRIENDS<br />+ Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.schoandjo.com">https://www.schoandjo.com</a><br />+ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fb.me/schoandjo">https://fb.me/schoandjo</a><br />+ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/schoandjo/">https://www.instagram.com/schoandjo/</a> <br />+ Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/schoandjo/">https://www.pinterest.com/schoandjo/</a><br />+ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/schoandjo">https://twitter.com/schoandjo</a><br />+ TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@schoandjo">https://www.tiktok.com/@schoandjo</a><br /> ________________<br />ABOUT US<br />Hi! We are high school sweethearts from Atlanta, Georgia who decided to take a year off to travel around the world. Together we decided to create vlogs for our journey as a fun way to remember it. On September 15, 2019, we left Atlanta with 3 bags, 2 one-way tickets, and 1 goal of traveling for a whole year. Little did we know, 6 months later we would find ourselves in a nationwide lockdown in India. After spending 5 months in India, we came back to the United States and decided to purchase a 34‚Äô Trawler, dive headfirst into boat life, and kick-off America‚Äôs Great Loop.<br />The good, the bad, the ugly ‚Äì and most importantly, the real and real funny. We‚Äôre not here to tell you ‚Äúhow it‚Äôs done.‚Äù, just how we‚Äôve done it. And that whatever it is that‚Äôs calling you - the way you‚Äôll do it is much more attainable than it may seem.<br /><br /> Thank you for following us along our journey!<br />________________<br />Note ‚Äî Some of these links are affiliates. We recommend stuff we love and if you like it also they might give us a small kickback. Thank you!{% endraw %}
