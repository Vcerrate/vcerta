My options were to do the typical YouTuber thing where you do progressively easier challenges while pretending that they are hard, or expand my content. I am trying my hand as a creator in other parts of the scene and I am very happy with the results so far.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the video!<br /><br />0:00 - Intro<br />0:59 - Liberation Day<br />1:30 - The Outlaws<br />2:19 - Zero Hour<br />2:35 - The Evacuation<br />3:52 - Smash and Grab<br />4:39 - The Devil's Playground<br />5:24 - Welcome to the Jungle<br />7:26 - The Dig<br />8:49 - Whispers of Doom<br />9:00 - Cutthroat<br />10:10 - Safe Haven<br />11:16 - The Moebius Factor<br />11:27 - A Sinister Turn<br />12:13 - Breakout<br />13:09 - Ghost of a Chance<br />13:33 - Echoes of the Future<br />14:26 - Chungus Among Us<br />15:50 - Media Blitz<br />16:37 - In Utter Darkness<br />17:12 - Piercing the Shroud<br />18:57 - The Mom of the Void<br />21:28 - Shatter the Sky<br />22:44 - All In<br />24:38 - I Love You{% endraw %}
