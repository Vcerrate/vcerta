{% raw %}Keys unlock doors. Big doors often unlock with small keys. Keys also lock doors to keep out unwanted things or people. Likewise, Wisdom keys are found all over the Bible and they help unlock not only Godly opportunities that you can tap into,  but they also ensure that the good things you receive because of walking in the light of Godâ€™s Word, stay safe! It pays to remember to carry your keys with you at all times if you want to live in victory over the circumstances of life!!<br /><br />Contribution and Bank Details:<br /><br />UPI Id (VPA) - elshaddai.1994@oksbi<br /><br />CONTRIBUTION FROM INDIA<br />All donation and contribution to this ministry in India only, may be sent by M.O. / D.D. / Cheques made payable to &quot;EL SHADDAI CHRISTIAN FOUNDATION&quot;<br />FOR NEFT TRANSFER / INTERNET BANKING<br />&quot;EL SHADDAI CHRISTIAN FOUNDATION&quot; SB A/c No. 12330100087177<br />THE FEDERAL BANK LTD.
