{% raw %}Hey guys, as you can see I decided to quit ca, Because of some private reasons etc.. And yea after 4 years of ca, 2 years of quarantine, 5 montages and 140k views overall I think I'm done with this game. About this montage, I was still collecting clips for better footage but I had to rush it a bit. Hope you guys like it.<br />I'll never forget you guys for supporting me all the way.<br />I just wanted to thank my second family LastLegacy. Im proud to be one of the oldest members of this awesome clan. I had the best times in this family. Especially ShaharS and iGuyMor, taught me everything about the quarantine world, taught me how to deserve being a member in the best quarantine clan. the best leader ShaharS, wonderful admins iGuyMor, Maybefuntime, Pioneer- and 31 talented, skillful soldiers, members that make us the best! I learned so much from you guys and I'll miss  the times we spent together. <br />GOODBYE ALL I WILL MISS YA!<br /><br />Song list: (we don't own any of them)<br />1. Ellie Goulding - Explosions<br />2. Lupe Fiasco &amp; Guy Sebastian - Battle Scars<br />3. Dr. Dre - I Need A Doctor ft.
