{% raw %}MASSIVE JACKPOT WINS ON LOW DENOM DRAGON LINK HAPPY &amp; PROSPEROUS A REAL SLOT MACHINE JACKPOT<br /><br />We do not share these slot machine jackpot videos to one up ng slot or lady luck or the big jackpot or brian christopher slots. We named our channel jackpot slot fantasy because we wanted to disclose to potential viewers our channel is not real in the same sense as those played in public casinos. Our videos are played on real slot machines we own and have in our home. We like many who have home theaters in their homes have what we call a home casino. We hope you enjoy the dragon link jackpot as this channel is known for high limit slots wins.<br /><br />There are those who'd get more return on their money if they were to invest their money in stocks to buy now or forex trading using apps like robinhood investing or webull day trading over playing slots since it's still gambling in our minds.<br /><br />Our father in heaven and Jesus would not support any soul on earth developing an addiction to anything much less gambling. While we don't see the term specifically in the Bible it would surely cause many to become ensnared by one or more of the seven deadly sins. Remember to give 10 percent to the church from your winnings if you choose to gamble.<br /><br />We take very extremely serious because we're not trying to support anything or encourage anything that might cause any single viewer to become influenced by these videos to the degree it causes anyone harm of any kind. We can no more help ourselves than we could help others without Jesus or the father in heaven it is not possible for man.<br /><br />Therefore we suggest if any viewer has a gambling problem or addiction they pray to Jesus to remove that addiction who through the holy spirit will remove it and if anyone feels they can't stop on their own if they reject asking for help from Jesus they should not continue to watch these. <br /><br />There are many things some very small that Jesus and our father consider much bigger than we do that can lead many to hell after this life, the Bible encourages us to avoid addiction of any type or kind by doing all things in moderation and within ones means so as not to injure another by our actions that may influence another. <br /><br />Our videos are not gambling we play in a home not public casino and use free play credit not cash and share what many consider movies use these to shed addictions not acquire them.<br /><br />Watch only so long as the viewing of these videos are for non-sinful purposes. <br /><br />The Seven Deadly Sins <br /><br />1. Lust<br />Lust is a strong passion or longing, especially for sexual desires.<br /><br />The Bible speaks about lust in 2 Timothy 2:22, “Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love [and] peace...”<br /><br />The Bible also mentions lust in the following verses: Job 31:1, Matthew 5:28, Philippians 4:8, James 1:14-15, 1 Peter 2:11 and 1 John 2:16.<br /><br />Chastity or self-control cures lust by controlling passion and leveraging that energy for the good of others.<br /><br />2. Gluttony<br />Gluttony is an excessive and ongoing eating of food or drink.<br /><br />1 Corinthians 10:31 says, “Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.”<br /><br />Additional Bible references include: Psalm 78:17-19, Philippians 3:19-20, Proverbs 23:1-3, Proverbs 23:19-21 and 1 Corinthians 3:16-17.<br /><br />Temperance cures gluttony by implanting the desire to be healthy, therefore making one fit to serve others.<br /><br />3. Greed<br />Greed is an excessive pursuit of material goods.<br /><br />The Bible says the following in Hebrews 13:5, “Let your conduct be without covetousness; be content with such things as you have. For He Himself has said, ‘I will never leave you nor forsake you.’”<br /><br />Other biblical texts which mention greed include: Exodus 20:17, Proverbs 11:24, Proverbs 28:25, Ecclesiastes 5:10, Philippians 4:6 and 1 Timothy 6:9-10.<br /><br />Charity cures greed by putting the desire to help others above storing up treasure for one’s self.<br /><br />4. Sloth<br />Sloth is an excessive laziness or the failure to act and utilize one’s talents.<br /><br />Solomon spoke of sloth in Proverbs 6:6 saying, “Go to the ant, you sluggard! Consider her ways and be wise.”<br /><br />The Bible also mentions sloth in the following verses: Proverbs 13:4, Proverbs 24:33-34, Romans 12:11-13, Colossians 3:23 and 2 Thessalonians 3:10.<br /><br />Diligence or zeal cures slothfulness by placing the interest of others above a life of ease and relaxation.<br /><br />5. Wrath<br />Wrath is a strong anger and hate towards another person.<br /><br />The Bible speaks about wrath in Romans 12:19, “Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, ‘Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.’”<br /><br />Additional Bible verses include: Psalm 37:8, Proverbs 14:29, Proverbs 15:1, Ephesians 4:26-27, Colossians 3:8 and James 1:19-20.<br /><br />Patience cures wrath by one first understanding the needs and desires of others before acting or speaking.<br /><br />6. Envy<br /><br />7. Pride{% endraw %}
