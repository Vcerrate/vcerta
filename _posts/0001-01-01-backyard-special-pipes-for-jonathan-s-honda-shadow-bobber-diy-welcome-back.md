{% raw %}Welcome back Lnspltrs, <br /><br />Jonathan wanted new pipes so I told him to design them and I'll try my best to bring 'em alive. The whole thing took me about 6 hours but you can watch them get built for 15 minutes. I gave them the name Backyard Special because they were built in my backyard.  I used the DIY exhaust kit from TC Bros and TJ Brutal's Exhaust flanges. Enjoy!<br /><br />Like always, thanks for watching!<br /><br />Send us stickers!<br /><br />LNSPLT BLVD<br />P.O.
