{% raw %}In this webinar, we discuss resources for supporting your juniors on essays this year, with a focus on counselors who work primarily one-on-one with their students.<br /><br />Looking to do a deep dive into up-leveling college essay support for your juniors?<br />If you found our webinar useful, I'm leading the How to Write a Personal Statement Course for Counselors in March, with a cohort specifically for college counselors that work one-on-one with students. You can learn more and register here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.collegeessayguy.com/how-to-write-a-personal-statement/counselor">https://www.collegeessayguy.com/how-to-write-a-personal-statement/counselor</a><br /><br />Prefer to send your students off to college essay camp this summer?<br />We created College Essay Guy LIVE! as a series of live summer essay and application boot camps for students in schools &amp; organizations that may not be able to get one-on-one support. In these live workshops, I walk students step-by-step through the process of writing great college essays and applications, and share a whole suite of tools and resources for doing just that.<br /><br />Heads up: College Essay Guy LIVE! is always free for students, and available pay-what-you-can for schools and organizations that may not have budget for professional development.
