{% raw %}Time is our most valuable asset!<br /><br />Realizing this simple statement we have decided to make the most of the time that we have and live the life we want now. For years we have gone to jobs, worked long hours just to make ends meet.<br /><br />For us that stops now!<br /><br />We have decided to sell everything (except our computers and cameras) and buy an RV, to take the Full Time life for the adventure of a lifetime. With Our RV Lifestyle We look forward to sharing our Journey with you “ExploringThrough Our Lens”<br /><br /><br /><br />Our Mission:<br /><br />Inspire others to live their lives,<br />by experiencing our journey as seen through the lens of our camera.<br /><br />About Us:<br /><br />Dan &amp; Patti Hunt<br />Dan &amp; Patti married 2 months before Dan became ill. Patti, a high school teacher for 20 years, has become an international speaker and trainer. Inspiring and educating others to live their dream. <br />Dan has worked in the entertainment industry for most of his life; actor, stuntman, producer and director. He even taught a film class at Villanova University, creating a film that was in contention for an Academy Award for a documentary he directed.<br /><br />After Dan’s illness, we took a chance and changed everything quitting our jobs and starting our own company. The mission at the time, which is still our core mission, is to help others before they get in the situation they found themselves just a few years before. They have traveled the world speaking to crowds from 100s to 1,000s of people, always with the message of positive thinking.<br /><br />We are that couple that does everything together. From shopping to cleaning and everything in-between. Working together can be challenging at times but if you have ever seen the two of us on stage you would see the magic we create.<br /><br />We are currently in the process of selling everything we own (except our computers and cameras equipment), buying an RV, take to the road and live our dream of seeing America and spending quality time with our 5 children, their 4 spouses, and 9 grandchildren that live on both coasts.<br />See Our Other Videos and Subscribe to our channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs2YjkNqfLAzB207o_QJ0xw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs2YjkNqfLAzB207o_QJ0xw</a><br /><br /><br />Explore Through Our Lens<br />Follow Us On Social Media:<br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/exploringthroughourlens">https://www.facebook.com/exploringthroughourlens</a><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/exploringthroughourlens/">https://www.instagram.com/exploringthroughourlens/</a><br />Twiter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DanandPattiHunt">https://twitter.com/DanandPattiHunt</a> tampa rv show 2021 digital nomad{% endraw %}
