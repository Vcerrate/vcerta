{% raw %}Lviv, Ukraine is one the best preserved historical cities in Central Europe. Itsâ€™ downtown core is protected by UNESCO and this is the heritage of the entire world and human civilization. <br /><br />We must save it and prevent any possible destruction. The city survived both World Wars and will hold on with all possible means including some protective measures taking place now.<br /><br />Not sure what will happen next! So now I invite you for a short virtual Lviv walking guide tour in order to appreciate this magnificent city and see what is now happening here.<br /><br /><br />Support - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://openmind.com.ua/support/">https://openmind.com.ua/support/</a> <br /><br />Guidelines for journalists - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lviv.travel/en/news/media-voennyi-stan">https://lviv.travel/en/news/media-voennyi-stan</a>{% endraw %}
