{% raw %}Today we're playing Warhammer 40K: Battlesector! It's a fun turn-based tactics game taking place within the Warhammer 40k universe. The latest Necron DLC releases alongside a new dynamic campaign, Planetary Supremacy! It's like Risk but it's nothing like that, and there's a robot skeleton!<br /><br />You can buy Battlesector from my store (&amp; DLC) - It helps me out a lot!: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nexus.gg/Janet/warhammer-40000-battlesector">https://www.nexus.gg/Janet/warhammer-40000-battlesector</a><br /><br />Join the Discord:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/gWVydDQ">https://discord.gg/gWVydDQ</a><br /><br />Follow me on Twitter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JanetOnOccasion">https://twitter.com/JanetOnOccasion</a><br /><br />Support the channel on Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/JanetOnOccasion">https://www.patreon.com/JanetOnOccasion</a><br /><br />Or you can become a member through Youtube:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdbuDbg7DTogK7NYA0UsgrQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdbuDbg7DTogK7NYA0UsgrQ/join</a><br /><br />Some of you might prefer to watch my Livestreams on Twitch:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/janetonoccasion">https://www.twitch.tv/janetonoccasion</a><br /><br />For business you can use my email address:<br />JanetOnOccasion@gmail.com<br /><br />Have a good day, guys.<br /><br />The outro music is a excerpt from the cover of &quot;King Of The Rodeo - Kings of Leon&quot; by a fine subscriber of mine that goes by the name of David McMichael.
