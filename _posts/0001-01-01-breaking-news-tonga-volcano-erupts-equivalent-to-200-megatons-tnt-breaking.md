{% raw %}Breaking News: Tonga Volcano Erupts Equivalent to 200 Megatons TNT<br /><br />The Tonga are a fraction of the power of the 200 megaton Krakatoa explosion, that went off near Indonesia in 1883. The tonga eruption ranks among the strongest in at least 30 years in terms of explosive yield, similar to the Mount St Helens eruption from 1980, which had an energy blast equivalent to 24 million tons of TNT. Some have compared Tonga to Krakatoa in eruption force, however, data purely on explosion puts Krokatoa at at least six times more powerful than Tonga. That doesn't mean Tonga wasn't devastating, and NASA said it was at least 500 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. <br /><br />Make sure to share this video with your friends!
