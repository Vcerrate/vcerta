{% raw %}Being a three-time Olympic bobsledder isn’t easy for anyone, but Christopher Spring does it while living out of his van. For a sport that’s driven by teamwork, hard work and intense training, Christopher's refusal to live by and accept society's norms is astonishing. As we follow Christopher's journey to succeed, we learn that it is more than just a journey to win in the 2019 World Championships in Whistler – it is a journey to find happiness.<br /><br />Directed by: Jonah Blaser<br />Produced by: Rachel Siegel, Jonah Blaser, Alluvium Productions<br />Music by: Michael Ferguson<br />Edited by: Rick Bartram<br />Coloured by: Morgana McKenzie<br /><br />The filmmakers would like to reflect on the land that we are on and created this film on. The documentary was filmed on location on the shared unceded territory of the Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish) and Lilwat7úl (Lil’wat) Nations. We honour their language, culture and history.<br /><br />It was also created on the Treaty Lands and Territory of the Mississaugas of the Credit and the traditional territory of the Anishinaabe, the Wendat, and the Haudenosaunee. The territory is within the lands protected by the Dish With One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe and allied nations to peaceably share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes.<br /><br />We are grateful to have worked and made this film on this land.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cbcsports.ca">http://cbcsports.ca</a> is your home for Canadian athletes, fans and the Olympic Games. <br /><br />Subscribe to CBC Sports: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/CBCSportsSub">http://bit.ly/CBCSportsSub</a><br /><br />CBC Sports' Beijing 2021 website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cbc.ca/olympics">https://cbc.ca/olympics</a><br /><br />CONNECT WITH CBC SPORTS ON SOCIAL<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CBCSports">https://www.facebook.com/CBCSports</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/cbc.sports">https://www.instagram.com/cbc.sports</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/cbcsports">https://twitter.com/cbcsports</a>{% endraw %}
