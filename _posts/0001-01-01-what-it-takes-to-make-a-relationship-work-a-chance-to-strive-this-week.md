{% raw %}This week we look at a few components that I think are important to make a relationship work but often overlooked. The second segment focused on things I felt that I needed to let go of, things I held onto from past relationships. Towards the end, we discuss good and bad advice that we’ve been given and what it’s meant for us.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I've always wanted to be there for people and growing up I realized that being there for people meant knowing what they needed at that moment: Sometimes people want advice and other times they need a distraction until they're ready. Through my podcast, I wish to be there for people and help bring joy into their life. We all need someone there for us, I just want to do my part for others that don't have that person for them.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Chance Strive -<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/chance_strive/">https://www.instagram.com/chance_strive/</a><br />Tik Tok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chance_strive?">https://www.tiktok.com/@chance_strive?</a><br /><br />Listen on Spotify and Apple Podcasts!<br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/41EN8c2Vz8kVc2iHbTELRu?si=5d2c9047d3934bf4">https://open.spotify.com/show/41EN8c2Vz8kVc2iHbTELRu?si=5d2c9047d3934bf4</a><br />Apple: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-chance-to-strive/id1593215209">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-chance-to-strive/id1593215209</a>{% endraw %}
