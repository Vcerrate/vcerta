I don’t always do this. Many times I apply a moisturizer after my retinoid. <br />💥 Retinoid: pea-sized amount to entire face<br />Totally fine to use another layer of moisturizer over your retinoid esp if you’re a beginner. <br /><br />Mahalo for watching 🙏🏼🤙😎<br /><br />I now have a Shop My Shelf- please check out to see my recommended products. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://myshlf.us/drdanielsugai">https://myshlf.us/drdanielsugai</a><br /><br />Thank you for subscribing and thank you for the 500K+ followers/friends on TikTok and NOW VERIFIED ON TIKTOK and Instagram?!
