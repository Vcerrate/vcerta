{% raw %}Another massive win just happened on my Twitch stream last night. Again I bought a couple of bonus buy on Big Bamboo trying to get an insane win and it popped off!<br /><br />This is my biggest win on this slot and I hope you guys enjoyed the video!<br /><br />📌 Check out my Twitch channel where I stream daily:<br />✔️ Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/ayezee">https://www.twitch.tv/ayezee</a><br />✔️ YouTube Exclusive: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/ayezee">https://www.youtube.com/ayezee</a><br />✔️ Join our discord server to interact with the community and see all stream updates! ➡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/ayezee​">https://discord.gg/ayezee​</a><br />Socials: <br />✔️ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AyeZeeCasino">https://twitter.com/AyeZeeCasino</a><br />✔️ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ayezeecasino/">https://www.instagram.com/ayezeecasino/</a><br />✔️ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AyeZeeCasino">https://www.facebook.com/AyeZeeCasino</a><br /> <br />#casino​ #slot​ #slots​ #gambling​<br /><br />I always emphasize in my stream how important gambling addiction awareness is to me and that it is not to be taken lightly. <br />1 - Don't think of gambling as a way to make money. <br />2 - Only gamble with money you can afford to lose.<br />3 - Set a money limit in advance: Decide how much you can afford to lose before you go to play. <br />4 - Set a time limit in advance. <br />5 - Never chase your losses: If you lose your set money limit and then try to win some of it back before you leave, then you haven't set a money limit. Chasing your losses will usually just lead to bigger and bigger losses.<br /><br />If you feel like you have trouble controlling yourself gambling please get professional help and restrict your accounts immediately!{% endraw %}
