If you go into the ocean, at the restaurant's left side, you will see a small krusty krab. If you touch it, it will teleport you to a game like work at a pizza place, but in the krusty krab. The game it teleports you to is called &quot;Work at a burger place&quot;<br />-As always, i might get some things wrong.<br /><br />➧Song:<br />-Work at a Pizza Place Night Time Eve{% endraw %}
