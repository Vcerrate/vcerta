{% raw %}As your projects get bigger, there will come a time when you need to know how to manage vendors, to get the best results from them. <br /><br />It can be tempting to see the relationship as competitive: one of you must lose, for the either to win. Nothing can be further from the truth.<br /><br />So, in this video, I will discuss how the best way of managing vendors is with a collaborative approach.<br /><br />This video started with a question:<br /><br />One of the biggest challenges I face at work is managing timelines when working with one or multiple vendors. Are there best practices for managing timelines while maintaining positive vendor relationships?<br /><br />But I decided to tackle the bigger question of how to manage vendors. <br /><br />It's all about the relationship.<br />If you start adversarially, you will find yourself in an adversarial relationship throughout. Particularly with a contract that focuses on penalties.  <br />If, on the other hand, you start collaboratively, you act that way throughout, and you reward collaborative working... Then you are most likely to have a collaborative relationship that delivers to time.<br /><br />I like a very simple project philosophyâ€¦ <br />'I don't care about the fault: I do care about the issue'<br />That is to say, tell me as soon as there is a problem. So we can all work on it together. Don't try to blame someone else. And don't worry about me blaming you. <br /><br />Whose fault it is, won't get it fixed <br />Surfacing the problem as early as possible, and working on it together will.<br />Set incentives so that everyone - all vendors and team members - share equally in success. Make it generous. And then everyone will recognize their best play is to help each other and not start throwing blame around. <br /><br />As Louis Darga (Dustin Hoffman's character) says in the film Papillon:<br />'Blame is for god and small children.'<br />On my projects, I know you're not one of those, and I don't expect you to act like the other. <br /><br />Do take a look at our detailed article, Project Procurement Management [All the basics you need to know]  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://onlinepmcourses.com/project-procurement-management/">https://onlinepmcourses.com/project-procurement-management/</a><br /><br />For more great Project Management videos, please subscribe to this channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMZfp1_wquyegVY9SoER0Nw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMZfp1_wquyegVY9SoER0Nw?sub_confirmation=1</a> <br /><br />For all our great Project Management articles and resources, please check out the OnlinePMCourses website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://onlinepmcourses.com/">https://onlinepmcourses.com/</a><br /><br />For basic Management Courses - free training hosted on YouTube, with 2 new management lessons a week, check out our sister channel, Management Courses: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/c/managementcourses">http://youtube.com/c/managementcourses</a><br /><br />For more of our Project Management videos in themed collections, join our Free Academy of Project Management: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://onlinepmcourses.com/free-academy-of-project-management/">https://onlinepmcourses.com/free-academy-of-project-management/</a><br /><br />#ProjectManagement #ProcurementManagement #VendorManagement{% endraw %}
