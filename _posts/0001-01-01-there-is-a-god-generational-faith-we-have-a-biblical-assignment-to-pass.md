{% raw %}We have a biblical assignment to pass our faith to the next generation. In this sermon, Pastor Allen Jackson highlights several places in the Bible where Jesus specifically discusses children, how they are treated, and their role in His Kingdom. Our God story begins even before our lives begin, and He has given each of us unique assignmentsâ€”including every child. Jesus warns us not to hinder their pursuit of Him, but to strengthen them in their faith and their knowledge of Him.<br /><br />Enjoy this message from Pastor Allen Jackson at World Outreach Church in Murfreesboro, TN.<br /><br />Follow Along!<br />PDF Notes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3gItfFp">https://bit.ly/3gItfFp</a><br />Mobile Notes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3uIZlZS">https://bit.ly/3uIZlZS</a><br /><br />Subscribe for more content from Pastor Allen Jackson: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmJ_L35KPnDoIfzbe4sfRQA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmJ_L35KPnDoIfzbe4sfRQA</a>  <br /><br />#pastorallenjackson #worldoutreachchurch <br /><br />Connect with Pastor Allen: <br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.allenjackson.com">http://www.allenjackson.com</a><br />Pastor Allen Jackson Web: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://allenjackson.com">https://allenjackson.com</a> <br />Pastor Allen Jackson Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pastorallenj...">https://www.facebook.com/pastorallenj...</a><br />Pastor Allen Jackson Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/pastorallen...">https://www.instagram.com/pastorallen...</a>{% endraw %}
