My name is Jerry Grzegorzek. I am the author and boss here. I am the Founder &amp; Editor-in-chief at SuperBusinessManager.com, the website provides business resources for better decision making. I live with my wife and our two children in China where I teach business management at one of the international schools. I am experienced Lecturer and Researcher in Business Management, Head of Business and Economics and IB Examiner for DP Business Management.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.superbusinessmanager.com/author/">https://www.superbusinessmanager.com/author/</a><br /><br />The Super Business Manager website is all about business. It provides business resources for better decision making. These business resources are especially useful for CEOs, directors and managers, business owners, investors, entrepreneurs, asset managers, politicians and government advisors, business teachers, business journalists and business students.<br /><br />With this online project, I aim to make business education accessible to everyone in the world in order to improve business knowledge and managerial skills.
