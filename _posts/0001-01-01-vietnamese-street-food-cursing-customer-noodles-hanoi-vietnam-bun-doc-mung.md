{% raw %}Bun Doc Mung - The first time for me to eat this Hanoian special dish. I don't think I could have picked a better place to try. Rich with tomatoes and a pork based broth. This place's real specialty is the dipping sauce used to dip all your additions in like pork rib, meat, tongue, northern meatballs, and etc. Also what feels like a somewhat healthy meal full of the elephant ear stem. <br /><br />Address: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/8NGisrQJERHZ3tsd6">https://goo.gl/maps/8NGisrQJERHZ3tsd6</a><br /><br />Che Thai - This was Chris's recommendation and he picked a popular place. You can't walk or drive past this place without it lined with locals for some sweet coconut soup. Nothing really stands out about this Che except the fact that it just hits all the right spots. <br /><br />Address: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/wu2akGZtbXcpcVLWA">https://goo.gl/maps/wu2akGZtbXcpcVLWA</a><br /><br />Xoi Thuy - A lady that has sold for over 30 years. Full of options for what you can have with your sticky rice. I know this place is more famous for their fried sticky rice, but I had to keep it simple and go with the plain. A delicious pate and braised pork belly. <br /><br />Address: 18 P.
