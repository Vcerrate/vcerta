{% raw %}you know what, i dont hate this take???? my timing is shit because (a) it always has been and (b) i havent played guitar regularly in four or so months since iâ€™ve been focusing on my visual art.<br /><br />i think i probably fudged the bridge(?) bc i have never been able to fucking keep track of how many times it. does that.<br /><br />this song used to be the only track on this album i could emotionally stomach, but now i use the entirety of be perfect or die to fall asleep. so. take that as you will. live laugh love. gaslight gatekeep girlboss or whatever you want to call it.{% endraw %}
