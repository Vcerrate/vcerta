Find it on all platforms here :)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rewildyoursoul.hearnow.com/luxnatura">https://rewildyoursoul.hearnow.com/luxnatura</a><br /><br /><br />Hello my Friends!<br />In this whole new handpan realm, we have hundreds of options to choose from.Even 5 years ago, the selection was far smaller and relegated to the large, well known makers, and a few smaller ones.<br /><br />Today, many people have taken up the hammer and started crafting quality instruments.With this shift in availability, I think it is important for people to make an informed choice.<br /><br />There are many many parameters to consider when purchasing your first instrument, so knowing some of the traits to look for, will allow you to chose an instrument/sound sculpture that suits your style and musical desires.<br /><br />These are MY opinions and experience owning and playing for many makers over the years, so you may have different beliefs.We are thankfully in a time where some&quot;smaller&quot; and larger ones makers are creating high quality instruments, at reasonable prices.<br /><br />This video is not an advertisement for any maker in particular, and is not intended to influence in that direction. The handpans used are ones I own or have access to , and illustrate some or all of the traits i enjoy in an instrument.<br /><br />Armed with the tools given here, you can begin to search for an instrument with a bit more clarity.<br /><br />Â Not addressed in this video are scales. A topic for future discussion! ;) <br /><br />These traits are NOT all necessary for you to be satisfied and to find a quality instrument, however, a combination of them, will help lead you towards a quality instrument.<br />Add your own tips below! :)<br /><br />Hope you find this helpful and remember,<br />Rewildyoursoul<br /><br />ps- stay till the end for an extra tune!<br /><br /> Booking and lesson inquires<br />www.rewildyoursoulmusic.com<br /><br />To Download my Music:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rewildyoursoul.bandcamp.com">https://rewildyoursoul.bandcamp.com</a><br /><br />#handpan#musician#rewildyoursoul{% endraw %}
