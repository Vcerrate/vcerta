{% raw %}Authors: Hao Chen, Kunyang Sun, Zhi Tian, Chunhua Shen, Yongming Huang, Youliang Yan Description: Instance segmentation is one of the fundamental vision tasks. Recently, fully convolutional instance segmentation methods have drawn much attention as they are often simpler and more efficient than two-stage approaches like Mask R-CNN. To date, almost all such approaches fall behind the two-stage Mask R-CNN method in mask precision when models have similar computation complexity, leaving great room for improvement. In this work, we achieve improved mask prediction by effectively combining instance-level information with semantic information with lower-level fine-granularity. Our main contribution is a blender module which draws inspiration from both top-down and bottom-up instance segmentation approaches. The proposed BlendMask can effectively predict dense per-pixel position-sensitive instance features with very few channels, and learn attention maps for each instance with merely one convolution layer, thus being fast in inference. BlendMask can be easily incorporate with the state-of-the-art one-stage detection frameworks and outperforms Mask R-CNN under the same training schedule while being faster. A light-weight version of BlendMask achieves 36.0 mAP at 27 FPS evaluated on a single 1080Ti. Because of its simplicity and efficacy, we hope that our BlendMask could serve as a simple yet strong baseline for a wide range of instance-wise prediction tasks.{% endraw %}
