{% raw %}In this video we will see workers working together in a very narrow space for hot tapping. These workers were tasked with connection of the existing pipeline 400 mm to a new pipeline 225 mm - the works were done on working pipeline under pressure in Tychy (Poland).<br />This work requires high concentration, smooth coordination and absolute precision because every mistake in the implementation process can cause a large pressure water leak.<br />The equipment used included FOX FIITTINGS's electrofusion branch saddles with big size outlets, and drilling equipment.<br />Let's watch the workers perform hot hap procedures<br />A hot tap saddle or weld nozzle installed, valve installed, assembly is pressure tested and hot tap machine attached.<br />Valve opened, hot tap completed, coupon or cut portion retained by latches on pilot drill. Pressure is contained within the hot tapping machine.<br />Cutter and coupon retracted and valve closed. Fluid is drained and hot tapping machine is removed. The tapped valve is now ready for the contractor’s tie-in or IFT’s linestop/stopple equipment to be inserted.{% endraw %}
