{% raw %}On the 28th of January, 1986, the Space Shuttle Challenger launched into a clear blue sky from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. On board were seven highly-trained astronauts, all of them braced to experience either the first or second space flight of their lives. But, just over a minute after take off, Challenger exploded in a massive fireball and a cloud of debris. Something catastrophic had gone wrong with the Shuttle… a malfunction that at least some people on the ground had raised concerns about before the launch even began.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:48 - Background<br />02:52 - The Challenger Disaster<br />05:52 - The Investigation<br />09:16 - The Aftermath<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery.
