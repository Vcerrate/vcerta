{% raw %}Attention Training Technique (ATT) is a 12 minute mental exercise used in Metacognitive Therapy (MCT). Studies have suggested that ATT can have significant effects on anxiety and depression. Furthermore, Metacognitive Therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment for mental disorders like depression and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD). [1, 3] One study showed even better result for MCT than CBT. [1]  According to one study, ATT increases the resting alpha and beta waves in the brain. [2] <br /><br />Attention Training Technique should only be used as a part of your Metacognitive Therapy. Talk to your therapist to ensure that it is right for you.<br /><br />This video has 4 different sounds. Waves, bells, birds and dripping water.<br />If you find this video too easy, try this instead:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyo6XTIh1M&amp;t=604s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyo6XTIh1M&amp;t=604s</a><br /><br />Instructions<br />Keep your eyes open throughout the exercise and focus your gaze on a spot on the wall. In this exercise you will become aware of your focus of attention and strengthen your control over it. The goal of Attention Training Technique is not to distract you from upsetting thoughts or feelings. They are actually likely to occur during the exercise. It is important to just let those experiences take care of themselves and view them as passing events in your body and mind. Your main goal is to focus on the sound and let everything else be just as it is. <br />You will be instructed focus your attention on different sounds for example the sound of a car. Let your focus stay on this sound until you get instructed to change focus to another sound. When a thought or feeling occur, let it be in the background and continue to focus on the sound. In this exercise nothing else is important.<br />The exercise is divided in 3 parts. In the first 5 minutes you will focus on a different sounds for 20 seconds each. In the following 5 minutes you will practice rapid attention switching and will focus on each sound for just 5 seconds. In the last 2 minutes, you will divide your attention between all sounds.<br /><br />Instructions are inspired by those found in Pia Callesens highly recommended book Live More Think Less [5]<br /><br />For those who want a deeper understanding of MCT, I recommend Adrian Wells book Metacognitive Therapy for Anxiety and Depression [4]<br /><br />I'm not a therapist and recorded these exercises for my own sake. Since I spent a lot of time doing them, I thought that they might be useful for others who go into MCT therapy. For questions regarding the exercises, see the links below or talk to your MCT therapist.<br /><br />For more information about Attention Training Technique<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mct-institute.co.uk/attention-training-technique/">https://mct-institute.co.uk/attention-training-technique/</a><br /><br />You can fint therapists here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mct-institute.co.uk/mct-registered-therapists/">https://mct-institute.co.uk/mct-registered-therapists/</a><br /><br />Litterature<br /><br />[1] Metacognitive Therapy versus Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in Adults with Major Depression: A Parallel Single-Blind Randomised Trial<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32398710/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32398710/</a><br /><br />[2] Single Dose of the Attention Training Technique Increases Resting Alpha and Beta-Oscillations in Frontoparietal Brain Networks: A Randomized Controlled Comparison<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01768/full">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01768/full</a><br /><br />[3] Randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of metacognitive therapy and intolerance-of-uncertainty therapy for generalized anxiety disorder<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22222208/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22222208/</a><br /><br />Books<br />[4] Metacognitive Therapy for Anxiety and Depression by Adrian Wells<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Metacognitive-Therapy-Anxiety-Depression-Adrian-ebook/dp/B005DIANYC">https://www.amazon.com/Metacognitive-Therapy-Anxiety-Depression-Adrian-ebook/dp/B005DIANYC</a><br /><br />[5] Live More Think Less: Overcoming Depression and Sadness with Metacognitive Therapy by Pia Callesen<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Live-More-Think-Less-Metacognitive-ebook/dp/B0821WJTLK">https://www.amazon.com/Live-More-Think-Less-Metacognitive-ebook/dp/B0821WJTLK</a><br /><br />Disclaimer: The Content has been made available for informational and educational purposes only.
