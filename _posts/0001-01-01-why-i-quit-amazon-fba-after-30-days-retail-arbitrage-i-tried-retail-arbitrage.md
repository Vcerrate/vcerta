{% raw %}I tried retail arbitrage on Amazon FBA for 30 days. I was able to make over $4,000 in revenue. I break down what went into getting to that number, from getting unrestricted in categories to how much time I spent to make that money.<br /><br />In the end, you can see that I ended up making a pretty underwhelming dollar amount per hour, I also talk about the big issue with FBA retail arbitrage, and that's scalability.<br /><br />Link to Anthony's channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/anthonybodanza">https://www.youtube.com/anthonybodanza</a><br /><br />When I got started with Online and Retail Arbitrage, I was confused with some of the different apps and software needed to start, so I made a list to try and help you start.<br /><br />Something that I forgot to mention is the usefulness of in my journey doing Amazon FBA and Retail Arbitrage a barcode scanner. I was on the edge of buying one, but when I did it increased my items scanned, and in turn, items were found tenfold. I was so shocked that I left a review for it on amazon. This is the one I used, and I recommend buying one when the budget allows. It will pay itself off.<br /><br />DM me on insta @stephyazzz<br />email me stephanyazvinski@gmail.com<br /><br />🟢These are affiliate links and the only way I make money from this channel.(plz use them) 🟢<br />Total Earned as of Feb 27:<br />$14.42<br /><br />🟠The inventory and scanning app:🟠<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3zbC6aR">https://bit.ly/3zbC6aR</a><br /><br />🟠 Bluetooth barcode scanner 🟠<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3cMbzqr">https://amzn.to/3cMbzqr</a><br /><br />🟠The repricer's I used(aura and bqool):🟠<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/2wfyu3uz">https://tinyurl.com/2wfyu3uz</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3qutKr6">https://bit.ly/3qutKr6</a><br /><br />🟠Price history charts:🟠<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://keepa.com/#!">https://keepa.com/#!</a><br /><br />🟠Youtube Stuff: (My camera &amp; Microphones)🟠<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3FRcnXH">https://amzn.to/3FRcnXH</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3CRnUEq">https://amzn.to/3CRnUEq</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3phac9d">https://amzn.to/3phac9d</a><br /><br />Link to article with simplified video contents <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/yjpzydy2">https://tinyurl.com/yjpzydy2</a><br /><br />🙏Thanks to Dylan Song for helping with sound design🙏<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />#RetailArbitrage #AmazonFBA #AmazonFbaRetailArbitrage #RetialArbitrageFBA #Reselling<br /><br />Chapters:<br />0:00 Intro<br />0:20 How it started<br />0:23 Dropshipping Legality on Amazon<br />01:10 Finding Product Manually<br />1:29 Finding out about retail arbitrage<br />2:00 Started Retail arbitrage <br />2:24 Selling Restrictions<br />3:12 Unrestricted by Wholesaler<br />3:38 First Sales<br />4:01 Best selling item<br />4:37 Joined BOLO group<br />5:06 First Replenishable <br />5:27 Anthony Collab and some issues<br />6:08 The Numbers and The Big Issue<br />6:47 Calculating the hourly Pay<br />7:17 The Funnel Guru Bad<br />7:35 Outro{% endraw %}
