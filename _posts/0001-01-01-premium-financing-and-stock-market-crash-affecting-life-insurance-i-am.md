{% raw %}I am here to save the farming industry and change the way farming is financed.  I refuse to just sit back and let these slimy insurance agents lie to you.<br /><br />You need to have some guarantees.  You can't build your farm or ranch operation on what-ifs when it comes to financing.  Don't let them risk your farm.<br /><br />The policy and how the policies are structured are critical to the success of using the Infinite Banking System.  Using insurance policies that are tied to the stock market and borrowing money from cash value to pay premiums is insane.  What happens if you don't have enough cash value to make the payments.<br /><br />We've talked about it before, but let's look again at what estate planners/agents are trying to do to save farms by borrowing against the land to pay premiums. This is so risky, and I have some actual numbers to share as to why this is not going to work.<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:46 Without The Bank Podcast<br />1:33 Premium Financing<br />4:20 Wacko Numbers<br />6:22 The Oversight<br />9:00 Market Crash<br />10:58 No Guarantees<br /><br />Previously recorded for Farming Without The Bank Podcast #144.<br />You can check out the rest of the episodes and subscribe here:<br />► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.farmingwithoutthebank.com/podcasts/">https://www.farmingwithoutthebank.com/podcasts/</a><br /><br />► Learn more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.farmingwithoutthebank.com">https://www.farmingwithoutthebank.com</a><br />► Get the book: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.farmingwithoutthebank.com/book">https://www.farmingwithoutthebank.com/book</a><br />► Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/farmingwithoutthebank">https://www.facebook.com/farmingwithoutthebank</a>{% endraw %}
