{% raw %}For decades, flooring installers have lugged pails of adhesive to job sites, struggled with lids and wasted unused adhesive. Now, they have a better option. Pouches are light, easy-to-open packages that are revolutionizing the way installers deal with flooring adhesives. The pouch is ideal for small jobs, but can also help to simplify large installations. It also speeds up installations with less mess and offers fresher product for easy handling. The pouch packaging is recyclable and weather-resistant.<br />Itâ€™s easy to carry pouches to the installation site. The pouch contains .75 of a gallon and is available in convenient two- and four-pouch boxes. Instead of pushing the pail across the floor as the installation progresses, installers simply set individual pouches in place in advance, snip the tail, squeeze the pouch, spread adhesive onto the subfloor, trowel the adhesive, lay the floor and move on to the next pouch. Plus, the pouch size reduces adhesive waste. There is less unused product, saving money and time.{% endraw %}
