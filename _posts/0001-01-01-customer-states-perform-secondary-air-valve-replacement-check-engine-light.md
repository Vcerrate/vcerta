{% raw %}Hey guys, today customer states that their check engine light is on. We scan the vehicle and there is a dtc present for Bank 1 Secondary air valve. We give the customer options that include replacement of both valves due to age or just one valve. This is that repair with a little extra mile service at the end. Enjoy!{% endraw %}
