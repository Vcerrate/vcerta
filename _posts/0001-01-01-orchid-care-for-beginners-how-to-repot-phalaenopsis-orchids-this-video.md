This will be an easy, step by step, detailed tutorial which will help you repot your Phalaenopsis Orchid the right way!<br /><br />Phalaenopsis orchids are the most popular Orchids on the market, but many times new Orchids are unhappy in their pots, so they require repotting into fresh, suitable medium. I am using products especially created for Orchids, from rePotme, visit their store here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.missorchidgirl.com/repotme2">https://go.missorchidgirl.com/repotme2</a><br /><br />The potting mix pages might have changed along the years, so some links below may not work in the future. So here is a general look at all their potting mixes you can choose from! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.missorchidgirl.com/orchid-mixes">https://go.missorchidgirl.com/orchid-mixes</a><br /><br />1. Unpot the orchid from its pot and gently remove as much of the old medium, or soil, as you can. Don't reuse it, it isn't good anymore!<br /><br />2. Rinse the Orchid roots at the sink with lukewarm water and further remove the old medium as much as you can, without breaking the roots.<br /><br />3. Cut away any mushy roots, they are not good for the Orchid anymore.<br /><br />4. Use a pot which is the same size, if the Orchid doesn't have many good roots, or one size up if the Orchid has a nice root system. Here are the pots I use <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/0-9OZArkHUU">https://youtu.be/0-9OZArkHUU</a> and you can purchase them from rePotme here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.missorchidgirl.com/Stjj80">https://go.missorchidgirl.com/Stjj80</a><br /><br />5. Use a good fresh Orchid medium, which suits your home, or environment.
