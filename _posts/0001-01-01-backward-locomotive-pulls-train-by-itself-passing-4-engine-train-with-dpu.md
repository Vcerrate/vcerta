{% raw %}Powerful Norfolk Southern Locomotive Pulls Train Long Hood Forward Past CSX Freight With 4 Locomotives!  Listen to the locomotives working hard on both trains pulling up grade.  These trains are in Cincinnati, Ohio just north of huge Queensgate Yard.  The CSX train with mid train DPU pulled up to wait for the shorter NS train to pass.  Right after the NS train passed the CSX train, the CSX train started working hard to get their train up to track speed.  Notice the NS locomotive running long hood forward like they use to do back in the N&amp;W days.  The old Baltimore And Ohio Railroad CPL signals are still in use here.  This location is known as Canal Ridge.  Amtrak and Indian &amp; Ohio Railway also use this track although they are difficult to catch especially since Amtrak only passes here 3 round trips a week.<br />       Filmed January 31, 2022.<br />      Thanks for watching!
