{% raw %}In this Episode of PIGGYPOWER we discuss the basic differences between DIRECT fuel injection and INDIRECT fuel injection systems.... The fuel being Diesel, of course.<br /><br />Much is generalised, many facts may now be different or superceded... I apologise if I've missed some things out... only so much I can try and squeeze into a short video about a rather complex subject!<br /><br />Please feel free to make suggestions for future videos, comment on your thoughts on which of these systems is better!<br /><br />------<br /><br />Thank you for watching...please share and like, comment too, I will read all and try to reply to as many as possible!<br /><br />Social media stuff:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/piggypowerofficial">https://www.facebook.com/piggypowerofficial</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/piggy.power/">https://www.instagram.com/piggy.power/</a>{% endraw %}
