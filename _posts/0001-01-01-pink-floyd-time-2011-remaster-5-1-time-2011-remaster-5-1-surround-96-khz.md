{% raw %}Time - 2011 Remaster - 5.1 Surround 96 kHz/24 bit - Immersion version<br />Album: The dark side of the moon (1973)<br />Lyrics:<br />Ticking away the moments<br />That make up a dull day<br />Fritter and waste the hours<br />In an off-hand way<br /><br />Kicking around on a piece of ground<br />In your home town<br />Waiting for someone or something<br />To show you the way<br /><br />Tired of lying in the sunshine<br />Staying home to watch the rain<br />You are young and life is long<br />And there is time to kill today<br /><br />And then the one day you find<br />Ten years have got behind you<br />No one told you when to run<br />You missed the starting gun<br /><br />(Solo)<br /><br />And you run and you run<br />To catch up with the sun<br />But it's sinking<br /><br />Racing around<br />To come up behind you again<br /><br />The sun is the same<br />In a relative way<br />But you're older<br /><br />Shorter of breath<br />And one day closer to death<br /><br />Every year is getting shorter<br />Never seem to find the time<br /><br />Plans that either come to naught<br />Or half a page of scribbled lines<br /><br />Hanging on in quiet desperation<br />Is the English way<br /><br />The time is gone<br />The song is over<br />Thought I'd something more to say<br /><br />Home<br />Home again<br />I like to be here<br />When I can<br /><br />When I come home<br />Cold and tired<br />It's good to warm my bones<br />Beside the fire<br /><br />Far away<br />Across the field<br />Tolling on the iron bell<br />Calls the faithful to their knees<br />To hear the softly spoken magic spell...<br /><br />℗ Digital Remaster 2011 The copyright in this sound recording is owned by Pink Floyd Music Ltd/Pink Floyd (1987) Ltd.<br />All rights go to Pink Floyd and EMI Music<br />Copyright © WMG{% endraw %}
