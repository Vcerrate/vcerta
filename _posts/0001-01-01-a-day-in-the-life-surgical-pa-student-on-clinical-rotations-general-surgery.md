{% raw %}MOST COMMON SUTURING TECHNIQUE IN GENERAL SURGERY: Buried interrupted &amp; the interrupted subcuticular stitch. I forgot to add the word &quot;AND&quot;. I apologize for any confusion. <br /><br />This video is a VLOG of my experience in my General Surgery Clinical Rotation. I am a current physician assistant student in my second year of PA school out on my surgery rotation. I never had an experience in the operating room prior to this rotation. I was a complete beginner. Through out my surgery rotation, I worked with surgeons, residents, surgical PAs, medical school students, and PA students. <br /><br />It was overall a great experience. I enjoyed general surgery more than I anticipated. I am still undecided of what specialty I will choose.... who knows, maybe I will become a surgical PA?!<br /><br />Please don't forget to LIKE &amp; SUBSCRIBE! It really does help me out a lot! <br /><br />Feel free to ask questions in the comment box or message me on instagram @Dani the PA<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Happy Life by Fredji<br />SC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/fredjimusic​">https://soundcloud.com/fredjimusic​</a><br />FB: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/fredjimusic/​">https://www.facebook.com/fredjimusic/​</a><br />Promoted by MrSnooze <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rhV_DIoebmU​">https://youtu.be/rhV_DIoebmU​</a><br /><br /><br />Song: Erik Lund - Summertime (Vlog No Copyright Music)<br />Music promoted by Vlog No Copyright Music.<br />Video Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/E338aF6QHu8​">https://youtu.be/E338aF6QHu8​</a><br /><br />Good Vibes by MBB <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/mbbofficial​">https://soundcloud.com/mbbofficial​</a><br />Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0) <br />Free Download / Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Lbe6vD​">http://bit.ly/2Lbe6vD​</a><br />Music promoted by Audio Library <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2sFxUXs_bTA​">https://youtu.be/2sFxUXs_bTA​</a>{% endraw %}
