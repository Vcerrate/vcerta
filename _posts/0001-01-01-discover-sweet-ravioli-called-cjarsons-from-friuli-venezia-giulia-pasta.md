{% raw %}Every village in the Carnic Alps has its own version of these sweet, somewhat savoury ravioli called cjarsons. Sometimes onion is added, sometimes green herbs and so on. This is Carmen's version from her village of Forni Avoltri. <br />Incidentally, the two bits of history mentioned in my voiceover are thanks to the Encyclopedia of Pasta by Oretta Zannini De Vita; a must on any pasta enthusiast's bookshelf.{% endraw %}
