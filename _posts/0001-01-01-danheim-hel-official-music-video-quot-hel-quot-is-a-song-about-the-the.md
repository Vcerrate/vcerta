{% raw %}&quot;Hel&quot; is a song about the the nine kingdoms of the dead in Viking mythology. &quot;Hel&quot; is very different from the Christian &quot;Hell&quot; <br /><br />Hel rules the nine worlds of death, which correspond to the nine worlds of life, and she assigns to anyone who arrives a suitable abode in proportion to the good or bad qualities of the souls or deeds. Some deceased can tumble on sun-drenched meadows, while others suffer. Those who suffer are led through the gates leading to the depths of Helheim and Niflheim, where matter must be decomposed. Hel is a realm where death represents a relaxing interlude and where souls spend an appropriate amount of time in their legitimate environment. The Eddas state that elves (human souls) sleep among the gods while celebrating with lots of mead, which is a symbol of the experiences of a previous period of life, and in this way the souls that rest after life are present in the divine spheres, even though they are unaware of their surroundings. In the Edda's &quot;Vagtamskvadet&quot; for example, the legend  about the sun god's death and arrival at Hel's home, tells us that a sumptuous apartment has been arranged, and mead is ready and freshly brewed upon his arrival.<br /><br /><br />Get song here:<br /><br />Bandcamp:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://danheim.bandcamp.com/track/hel">https://danheim.bandcamp.com/track/hel</a><br /><br />Spotify:<br />Coming soon..<br /><br />iTunes:<br />Coming soon..<br /><br /><br />Lyrics:<br />(Danish)<br />Svagt vokser mit syn, skumle mørke.<br />Hadefulde norner, strikker min skæbnetråd.<br />Skæbnekamp forgæves.<br />Den udsultede ravn fortæller om hel, de dødes ni riger.<br />Hvor kan jeg hvile mig? med dem jeg husker, blandt mine egne.<br />Langt fra Helheim og Niflheims dybder.<br />Mit håb er gyldent mjød og tændte kævler,<br />Hvad skal jeg gøre, for at varme mine hænder?<br />Ni ringe jeg ofre, runer jeg rister, sange jeg synger.<br /><br />English translation:<br />My vision grows faint, eerie darkness.<br />Hateful Norns, knit my destiny-thread.<br />Battling your destiny is in vain.<br />The starving raven tells of Hel, the nine kingdoms of the dead.<br />Where can I rest? with those I remember, among my own.<br />Far from the depths of Helheim and Niflheim.<br />My hope is golden mead, and lit logs,<br />What should I do to warm my hands?<br />Nine rings I sacrifice, runes I carve, songs I sing.<br /><br />Danheim's Spotify Playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5V8zOkOKntRtYNsc2paiyN?si=722269e77a384bd7">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5V8zOkOKntRtYNsc2paiyN?si=722269e77a384bd7</a><br /><br />Follow me on Facebook:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/DanheimMusic/">https://www.facebook.com/DanheimMusic/</a><br /><br />Follow me on Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/danheim_music/">https://www.instagram.com/danheim_music/</a><br /><br />Music Licensing:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://danheimmusic.com/license-music/">https://danheimmusic.com/license-music/</a><br /><br />Illustration &amp; Animation by Ukranian artist:<br />Selin Serhii<br />----<br />viking music, fantasy music, and battle music.{% endraw %}
