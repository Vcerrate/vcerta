All I knew going in is that it probably featured a &quot;tall girl&quot; in some capacity, and I was right! What I didn't see coming? A tall boy. And a small boy! I've already said too much...<br /><br />For this Netflix drama / teen drama I am joined by my good friend / ex-roommate Derick! Some may recognize him from appearances in Nyctophobia, Pity Applause, and even an old PMI review, but for most of y'all this is your introduction and I have a feeling he's gonna be your new fav.<br /><br />We laughed our asses off and we truly couldn't be more excited for Tall Girl 2. In the meantime... enjoy Tall Girl The First!<br /><br />This is an audio commentary ONLY. It is meant to be watched along with the movie so you can raise or lower the volume on the commentary or the movie itself as you wish.<br /><br />#daddys #little #tallgirl{% endraw %}
