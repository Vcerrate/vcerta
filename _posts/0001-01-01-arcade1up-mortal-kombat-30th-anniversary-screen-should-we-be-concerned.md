Arcade1Up put up preorders for their new legacy cabinets yesterday with improved form factors, more games and online features for a very consumer friendly price of $499 US. Almost too good to be true right? Well some of the images included in the product packages on the Arcade1Up website have fans extremely concerned these new cabs may share the same monitor issues as the recently released XL cabinet  line for Arcade1Up.<br /><br />MK 30 Pre Order: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arcade1up.com/products/midway-legacy-arcade-machine-mortal-kombat-30th-anniversary-edition">https://arcade1up.com/products/midway-legacy-arcade-machine-mortal-kombat-30th-anniversary-edition</a><br /><br />Check me out on:<br /><br />Patreon: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/MichaelBtheGameGenie">http://www.patreon.com/MichaelBtheGameGenie</a><br /><br />Welcome to my channel. I have been playing and collecting games since 1987 and I use this channel to share my passion and memories of gaming. I review games that I believe are under appreciated or wrongfully dismissed on Game Genie Reviews. Video Game Nostalgia is a fun series where I take a look at a topic from my gaming past and share games that come to mind from it. I also do Top 10 lists, of course I do...what else is on youtube right? Well I like to think I put my own spin on them because they are based on my life in gaming. Hope you enjoy the channel and always looking forward to hearing from you. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://gamester81.com/">http://gamester81.com/</a><br /><br />Facebook: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MichaelBtheGameGenie">https://www.facebook.com/MichaelBtheGameGenie</a><br /><br />Twitter: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MikeBGameGenie">https://twitter.com/MikeBGameGenie</a><br /><br />Instagram: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/mikebgamegenie">http://instagram.com/mikebgamegenie</a> <br /><br />Twitch: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/michaelbthegamegenie">http://www.twitch.tv/michaelbthegamegenie</a><br /><br />All music and video used are the property of their respective owners.<br /><br />&quot;Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
