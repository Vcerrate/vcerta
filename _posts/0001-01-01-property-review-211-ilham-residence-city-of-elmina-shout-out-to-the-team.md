{% raw %}Shout-out to the team for showing me their latest stratafied landed project. For appointment arrangements, do contact them <br />Website : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.simedarbyproperty.com/elmina-grove/ilham-residence/">https://www.simedarbyproperty.com/elmina-grove/ilham-residence/</a><br />Phone : 013-994 9433 (Victor)<br /><br />First of all, it's amazing to witness and document the transformation of this masterplan. Started from only roads, now it's one of the most popular locations for landed homes. And this latest launch marks that point of sophistication in growth where now buyer not only want quantity of space, they want quality too. <br /><br />I didn't quite get it at first because I personally enjoy the treatments of their individual title properties, so why launch landed strata when it's so difficult to explain the differences. But when you look into their sales performance, its a product diversification strategy. The team have launched so many landed terrace houses in the past and the current products have shown all their experience. Although the current size of houses are small, they felt pretty compact as all spaces are well laid. <br /><br />From a township perspective, this township has gathered lots of interest with it's park and natural resources. With the upcoming completion of commercial areas, it's gonna be very convenient for the existing residents. A brand new shopping mall is coming up too. <br /><br />However, I'm personally still waiting for the completion of DASH highway but that's beyond the scope of the developer. But it will definitely be completed if you're getting this new phase of development.{% endraw %}
