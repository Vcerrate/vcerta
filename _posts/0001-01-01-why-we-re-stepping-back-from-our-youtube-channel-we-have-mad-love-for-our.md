Most surprising isn't what we're missing...it's how wonderful and rich our life is with our lower spending. We like to share what we're doing and learning here on our channel.<br /><br />Please check out our other videos. They cover house sitting, award travel/travel hacking, and our early retirement/FIRE (financially independent, retired early). And, of course, travel! Lots of our videos show the fun stuff we do on a budget around the world. <br /><br />You can find us at... <br />Our Website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gowithless.com/">https://www.gowithless.com/</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GoWithLess/">https://www.facebook.com/GoWithLess/</a> <br />Our Amazing Facebook Group - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/552873059012708">https://www.facebook.com/groups/552873059012708</a><br />Twitter- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GoWithLess">https://twitter.com/GoWithLess</a> <br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/wegowithless/">https://www.instagram.com/wegowithless/</a> <br />TikTok - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gowithless">https://www.tiktok.com/@gowithless</a><br /><br />Some of our links are affiliate links.
