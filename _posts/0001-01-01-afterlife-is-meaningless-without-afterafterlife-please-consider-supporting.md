Why does meaning require eternity?<br /><br />I received some comments like these on my portrayal of heaven:<br />&quot;It would be an eternal state of love, happiness, and joy, next to God.&quot;<br />&quot;It would be like a big party.&quot;<br />My answer:<br />The bible says you will be worshiping God for all eternity. If that's so wonderful, then why don't you worship God 24/7 in your life right now? If this &quot;state&quot; of love, happiness, and joy is compulsory, then is it truly you? Doing anything - even partying - for an eternity would eventually become a torment. Quadrillions of years might as well be a microsecond.<br /><br />Thank you, GrapplingIgnorance, for sharing your script and allowing my additions and adjustments.
