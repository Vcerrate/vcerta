{% raw %}In a virtual media briefing on Wednesday, NASA officials reported that the James Webb Space Telescope's primary mirror is aligned correctly and working even better than it was expected to do. The 18 hexagonal parts of the 21.3-foot-wide (6.5-meter) mirror had to go to space curled. Since the vast telescope's launch on December 25, one of the critical objectives for the Webb control team has been to align it into a single smooth reflecting surface. Authorities said the alignment process was finished, which entailed fine-tuning the locations and angles of the 18 parts with nanometer-scale precision. The $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope mission, the most complicated and expensive such observatory ever launched- yields photos that take scientists' breath away, even though the procedure is not yet complete. In this video, we will be discussing about James Webb Space Telescope's 1st view of cosmos.{% endraw %}
