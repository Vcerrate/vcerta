{% raw %}Planting wisteria in the ornamental garden! Here is how I planted a new wisteria vine and my plan for training it into a full-grown flowering climber. <br /><br />🌿  Choose an open area with full sun, air flow, and root space<br />🌿  Plan for a support lattice structure<br />🌿  Keep soil moist (try drip irrigation and organic mulch)<br />🌿  Remove any dead, dying, damaged, or diseased stems<br />🌿  Leave one or two of the strongest shoots to begin training<br />🌿  Gently tie stems to the support trellis/wire<br />🌿  Minimize pruning of young plants after initial planting<br />🌿  Top-dress soil with homemade organic compost each spring<br />🌿  It generally takes 3 years for Blue Moon wisteria to bloom<br /><br />Blue Moon Wisteria (Wisteria macrostachya 'Blue Moon') 🌚  is a selected cultivar of Kentucky wisteria known for its cold-hardiness (to minus 40!) and its stunning lavender-blue trailing flowers.<br /><br />Here are some more details on the type of wisteria I planted: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.homefortheharvest.com/blue-moon-wisteria/">https://www.homefortheharvest.com/blue-moon-wisteria/</a><br /><br />🤓 MY GARDENING BLOG 🤓<br />My Blog Home Page - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.homefortheharvest.com/">https://www.homefortheharvest.com/</a> <br /><br />💕 MY AFFILIATE PARTNER LINKS 💕<br />Terrain Home &amp; Garden - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8463697/type/dlg/https://www.shopterrain.com/">https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8463697/type/dlg/https://www.shopterrain.com/</a> <br />EarthEasy Home &amp; Garden - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://alnk.to/e6ZBwuB">https://alnk.to/e6ZBwuB</a> <br />Hoss Garden Tools - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/2q1t2">https://shrsl.com/2q1t2</a> <br />Botanical Interests Seeds - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/2q1t4">https://shrsl.com/2q1t4</a> <br /><br />🔗 MORE LINKS🔗<br />Amazon Recommendations - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/homefortheharvest/">https://www.amazon.com/shop/homefortheharvest/</a> <br /><br />Affiliate links to shops mean that if you choose to use them I may earn a small commission from your purchase at no additional cost to you.
