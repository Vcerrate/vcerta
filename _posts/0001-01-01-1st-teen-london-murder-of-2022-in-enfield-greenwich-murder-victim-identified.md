{% raw %}A 14 year old male has also been arrested for the Enfield murder.<br />Detectives investigating the murder of 18-year-old Donovan Allen in Enfield have made a second arrest.<br />An 18-year-old man [B] was arrested on Wednesday, 9 February on suspicion of murder. He remains in custody at a north London police station.<br />Police were called to the location at 18:10hrs on Monday, 7 February following reports of a stabbing.<br />Officers attended along with paramedics from the London Ambulance Service and found Donovan injured.<br />Despite the best efforts of the emergency services, he sadly died at the scene.<br />A post-mortem examination held on Wednesday, 9 February found that Donovan died from a single stab wound to the chest.<br />Homicide detectives from the Met's Specialist Crime Command are investigating and enquiries are ongoing.<br />In a statement, Donovanâ€™s family said: â€œDonovan was born small with his dad, nana and three uncles at his birth. From the start he was surrounded by love and he went on to increase and attract more love as he grew.<br />â€œHis judo instructor, football coach and even his barber loved him so much. His friends were of every age, colour and walk of life.<br />â€œHe would pray for his friends and family every morning and night, and even the last morning one of us spoke to Don, he said - &quot;I've said my prayers and done 40 press ups. I'm doing well, aren't I?&quot;.<br />â€œEvery child is special, we know that, but Donovan was exceptional because his gift was making others feel special. He thought everyone was kind like him.<br />â€œYes, he was a mummyâ€™s boy, but he was a daddyâ€™s boy, uncle's boy, auntyâ€™s boy, and his grandparentsâ€™ boy. He was confident, charming and was very much adored by his younger siblings.<br /><br />ðŸ”´ Follow Scarcity on socials ðŸ”´  <br />ðŸŸª Insta: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ScarcityInsta">https://bit.ly/ScarcityInsta</a> ðŸŸª<br />ðŸŸ¥ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ScarcityFB">https://bit.ly/ScarcityFB</a> ðŸŸ¥<br />ðŸŸ¦Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ScarcityTwitter">https://bit.ly/ScarcityTwitter</a> ðŸŸ¦<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scarcity-studios.com">https://www.scarcity-studios.com</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1XI4TFW_nEY4IFfTxUUkCg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1XI4TFW_nEY4IFfTxUUkCg/join</a><br /><br />Alpha Claims and Hire are Birmingham's leading accident management company specialising in non-fault claims. <br /><br />Are you a taxi driver?<br />Have you been involved in a accident?<br />Do you need a accident replacement car?<br /><br />Call us on: 0121 327 0382<br /><br />We stock cars for Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Solihull, Walsall Councils, and many more councils across the UK.<br />Alpha claims and hire stocks euro 6, clean air zone compliant cars. <br /><br /><br />************************************************<br /><br />Alpha claims and hire opened its doors in 2009.
