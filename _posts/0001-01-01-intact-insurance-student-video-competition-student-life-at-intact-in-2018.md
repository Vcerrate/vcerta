{% raw %}In 2018, we launched our first annual Student Video Competition challenging students to get creative and share their experiences as members of the Intact team. <br /><br />Our judges (Vice Presidents within the company) were so impressed by the submissions, they picked two winners! You can see the other winning video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wXkqs8vL2RM.">https://youtu.be/wXkqs8vL2RM.</a><br /><br />As one of Canadaâ€™s Top Employers for Young People, we understand the importance of offering Students a challenging and inspiring experience with us.  Not only does it set them up for future success, but their unique skills and perspectives enrich the work we do and make our teams stronger. <br /><br />Are you a student or new grad ready to jump into an exciting, new career?
