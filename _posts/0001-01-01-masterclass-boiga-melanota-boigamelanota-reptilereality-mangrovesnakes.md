{% raw %}#BoigaMelanota #ReptileReality #MangroveSnakes<br />As I have said before, any animal with a black and yellow color scheme is almost always deemed attractive by human beings.  The Western Mangrove Snake is one of the most impressive species in the Boiga genus.  It is big, robust and they actually make pretty good captives if provided for correctly.  That is what this Masterclass video is all about....thanks for watching!!!<br /><br />Instagram: dm_exotics<br />Facebook: DM Exotics<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dmexotics.com">https://www.dmexotics.com</a><br />Twitter: @DanMullearyâ€‹<br />Email: dan@dmexotics.com<br /><br />Music used in this video comes from HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/svmkkn/.">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/svmkkn/.</a>{% endraw %}
