In a hopeful message to people of all faiths, to those who have power as well as those who don't, the spiritual leader provides illuminating commentary on the world as we currently find it and calls for equality, solidarity and tenderness to prevail. &quot;Let us help each other, all together, to remember that the 'other' is not a statistic, or a number,&quot; he says. &quot;We all need each other.&quot;<br /><br />The TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less). Look for talks on Technology, Entertainment and Design -- plus science, business, global issues, the arts and more.<br /><br />Follow TED on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/TEDTalks">http://www.twitter.com/TEDTalks</a><br />Like TED on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TED">https://www.facebook.com/TED</a><br /><br />Subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/TED">https://www.youtube.com/TED</a>{% endraw %}
