{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://curiositystream.com/notjustbikes">https://curiositystream.com/notjustbikes</a> for a 26% discount on Curiosity Stream + Nebula for free. Only US$14.79 for the first year, which, you gotta admit, is a pretty insanely low price for what you're getting, eh?<br /><br />Watch this video ad-free on Nebula: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nebula.app/videos/notjustbikes-the-only-carfree-neighbourhood-in-canada-and-why-you-cant-live-there">https://nebula.app/videos/notjustbikes-the-only-carfree-neighbourhood-in-canada-and-why-you-cant-live-there</a><br /><br />Just off the coast of Toronto, Canada's largest city, you'll find a group of 15 small car-free islands. These are unique in Canada, because they have the only* car-free neighbourhood in the whole country. But just in case you thought you'd like to live here: you can't. There is a waiting list and strict rules for home ownership, which begs the question, why can't we build more of these places today?<br /><br />In this video I explore the history and present of the Toronto Island, and talk about other car-free places in the world that I'd also like to cover in future videos on Nebula.<br /><br />*there is actually another car-free neighbourhood in Canada, Harrington Island, but it's extremely remote and nobody goes there so that doesn't count. :)<br /><br />If you're already on Nebula, my Giethoorn video can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nebula.app/videos/notjustbikes-the-dutch-town-with-canals-instead-of-roads-giethoorn">https://nebula.app/videos/notjustbikes-the-dutch-town-with-canals-instead-of-roads-giethoorn</a><br /><br />---<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/notjustbikes">https://patreon.com/notjustbikes</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/notjustbikes">https://twitter.com/notjustbikes</a><br />Reddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://reddit.com/r/notjustbikes">https://reddit.com/r/notjustbikes</a><br />One-time donations: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bunq.me/notjustbikes">https://bunq.me/notjustbikes</a><br /><br />NJB Live (my bicycle livestream channel):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9v57F4xz46KaDsvWfCv8yw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9v57F4xz46KaDsvWfCv8yw</a><br /><br />---<br />Credits, References, and Additional Information<br /><br />Honouring a humble yet popular device<br />The Globe and Mail <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/honouring-a-humble-yet-popular-device/article736619/">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/honouring-a-humble-yet-popular-device/article736619/</a><br /><br />Ultimately David Dennis came up with the first design for the post and ring bike rack, but Jack was apparently involved in the initial ideas, and was responsible for the popularization of it for sure. <br /><br />Timbits by Raysonho @ Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine -
