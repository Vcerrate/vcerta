{% raw %}BEFORE ANYONE COMES FOR ME IN THE COMMENTS. Please note that I do understand the dangers of smoking to my health .... I have been smoking since I have 15 years old .... SO understand that is in fact a full-blown addiction! and addiction is never easy or simple or a clear-cut path .... thank you for being kind and supportive! So this week I take on the challenge of quitting smoking.... I will say I lasted a total of four days before relapsing ..... This is has been incredibly tough for me .... Dealing with multiple stressors on a constant basis can sometimes be overwhelming for me .... As well I have run out of my antidepressant and anti anxiety medications so my moods and feelings have shifted ... the only thing that has ever brought me any comfort is smoking .... now especially since I can not eat my emotions ... I'm not sure where the solution is for me but I will continue to keep quitting .... Until finally, I get it right ....{% endraw %}
