{% raw %}I enjoy watching other YouTube channels with people who travel or show a bit of where they are from especially if it's some place I may never otherwise see.  For that reason I'm again sharing a little bit of our area.  The historic home we passed on highway 90 in Biloxi was the home of Jefferson Davis, a president of the confederate states during the mid 1800's.  The big white building in the middle of the property was built in the 1990's I think.  I know it wasn't there when I toured the place as a kid on a field trip.<br /><br />The marina and light house we visit in this video used to be part of The Broadwater Beach Resort Marina.  This was a beautiful property in the 80's.  I used to inspect boats there for insurance companies.  The tidal surge from hurricane Katrina wiped this property clean including the hotel that was on the other side or the highway.  I'm really surprised it wasn't rebuilt.  I would love to see it restored to it's former glory one day.  I suspect they may have been suffering from a financial down turn in the 90's which is likely why the President casino ended up docked in this marina.<br /><br />This hive removal, while not unusually difficult for us, posed a problem a shorter person may have had trouble dealing with.  The back of the hive, or outer edge, was well out of reach of Pete.  I could barely reach the last combs.  To get to that one you would have to be incredibly narrow to fit between joist or have long arms.  Pete is just under 6' tall and he couldn't reach.  The average person would probably have to engineer a way to reach that outer framing to scrape or cut the wax off.  We also had to be careful no to drop comb.  There was about a three inch gap between the framing and the brick veneer that was in the bottom of the space we were working.<br /><br />Learn beekeeping in our forum at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://forum.628dirtrooster.com/">https://forum.628dirtrooster.com/</a><br /><br />If you need to send anything our way our address is:<br />Randy McCaffrey or 628 Dirt Rooster<br />P.O.
