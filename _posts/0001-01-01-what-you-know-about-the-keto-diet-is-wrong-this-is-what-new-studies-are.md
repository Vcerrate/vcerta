No need to live completely devoid of carbohydrates on a keto diet any longer.<br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br /><br />0:00 | Introduction to Dr. Steven Gundry<br />0:55 | What You Got Wrong About Keto<br />8:05 | Why Mitochondria Is Key to Keto<br />12:22 | Metabolic Flexibility &amp; Fat Burning<br />18:53 | What Ketones Are Signaling<br />23:05 | Mitochondrial Uncoupling<br />34:53 | The Miracle Weight Loss Drug<br />39:38 | Benefit of Polyphenols<br />46:35 | Mitochondria DNA is Female<br />50:01 | Restricted Eating &amp; Feeding Times<br />56:40 | Blue Zone Diets &amp; Goat Milk<br /><br /><br /><br />QUOTES:<br /><br />“50 percent of normal weight individuals have no metabolic flexibility.” [13:03]<br /><br />“At full ketosis, human beings can only meet 30% of their calorie needs by burning ketones. The rest have to come from free fatty acids and glucose.” [19:09]<br /><br />“Ketones are not a super fuel, they are actually a signaling molecule that tells mitochondria to protect themselves at all cost from damage” [20:15]<br /><br />“In a ketogenic diet, if you do it right and uncouple your mitochondria, you waste fuel. You feed six dogs instead of one, and that's where the benefit of ketosis comes from.” [30:21]<br /><br />“You want to cycle in and out of ketosis on a 24 hour basis.” [49:37]<br /><br />“It's the cycling in and out of getting the benefits of ketosis. Without full ketosis, that makes all  the difference.” [56:29]<br /><br /><br />Follow Dr. Steven Gundry<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gundrymd.com/">https://gundrymd.com/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gundrymd/">https://www.instagram.com/gundrymd/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GundryMD/">https://www.facebook.com/GundryMD/</a><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtxo0nTZjzlKJq5-vJq6s6g">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtxo0nTZjzlKJq5-vJq6s6g</a>{% endraw %}
