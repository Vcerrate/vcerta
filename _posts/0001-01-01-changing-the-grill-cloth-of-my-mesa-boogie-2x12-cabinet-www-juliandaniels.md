It has a great sound, the only things that was annoying was the worn out front grill cloth. So I decided to buy a new grill cloth. It was very easy to do that. Now it almost looks like a new cabinet with a good looking grill cloth.<br /><br /><br />Social Media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/juldani82/">https://www.instagram.com/juldani82/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/JulDani82/">https://www.facebook.com/JulDani82/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/julian-daniels">https://soundcloud.com/julian-daniels</a>{% endraw %}
