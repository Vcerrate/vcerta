{% raw %}Solothurn is more than a destination for a short city break. It has the same range as a large town â€“ just on a more compact scale. The old town with its charming little lanes and authentic boutiques is not only a shopping experience for the ladies. Anyone who loves historical sights and cafes by the water will also be in their element here. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/experiences/cities-culture/stories/a-breathtaking-baroque-city-trip/">https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/experiences/cities-culture/stories/a-breathtaking-baroque-city-trip/</a><br /><br />----<br />Switzerland. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://MySwitzerland.com">http://MySwitzerland.com</a>{% endraw %}
