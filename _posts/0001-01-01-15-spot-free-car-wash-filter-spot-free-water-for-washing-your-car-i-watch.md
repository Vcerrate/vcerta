{% raw %}I watch as many Car Detailing videos on YouTube as anyone... I recently came across an inline water filter that people claim works really well for washing your car with a spot free finish.  As a professional car detailer that uses a very large DeIonized Water set up to achieve spot free results, I was very curious to get my hands on these filters and see what they can really do.  I put this to the test and see just how well these work for spotless car washes. The water that comes out of the wall at my detail shop is pretty contaminated with total dissolved solids (TDS) at just a bit more than 400 parts per million (ppm). This filter definitely reduces that total ppm of tds, but by how much exactly?  And is it good enough to get a spot free car wash at home?
