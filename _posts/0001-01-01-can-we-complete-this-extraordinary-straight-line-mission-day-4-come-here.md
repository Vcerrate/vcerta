{% raw %}*Comments WILL contain spoilers*<br /><br />It's been quite a ride, but this series is almost over. I had every intention of this mission being my most boring mission yet. It turned out to be the exact <br />opposite. The ultimate goal of a perfect, continuous run may have slipped away from us on day 3 in tragic fashion, but we can still walk every step of this line and damn well complete it. Or can we? Would anything surprise you at this point?<br /><br />*Some speech might be difficult to hear - use good speakers/headphones if possible and use the man made subtitles*<br />________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Listen to &quot;16-Bit Adventure&quot; featuring all the music<br />from this adventure, How not to travel Europe and more:<br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3m1MNiRkBOY2Lz5EAXG1BB">https://open.spotify.com/album/3m1MNiRkBOY2Lz5EAXG1BB</a><br />Or purchase it on Bandcamp for Â£4 here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amynedd.bandcamp.com/album/16-bit-adventure">https://amynedd.bandcamp.com/album/16-bit-adventure</a><br />________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Ben's Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/williewetlegs/">https://www.instagram.com/williewetlegs/</a><br />________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Support me on Patreon &amp; watch the next episode a day early: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/geowizard">https://www.patreon.com/geowizard</a><br /><br />Subscribe to the channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5OrUZ4SeUYkUg1XqcjFYA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5OrUZ4SeUYkUg1XqcjFYA?sub_confirmation=1</a>{% endraw %}
