{% raw %}This is how to assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled. <br /><br />“The ability to feel the unseen . . to actualize and make real a definite subjective state through the sense of feeling is the secret of creation . . by which the word or unseen desire is made visible—is made flesh.” Neville Goddard<br /><br />“For whoever has, to him shall more be given, and he shall have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.” Matt 13:12<br /><br />“I go to prepare a place for you. If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.” John 14:2-3<br /><br />Join us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter:<br /><br />Facebook: @besomethingwonderful <br />Instagram and Twitter: @tomkearin<br /><br />Be Something Wonderful, When Suddenly You Want To Be More by Tom Kearin is available exclusively on Amazon at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Amazon.com/dp/B077VYVBKP/">https://Amazon.com/dp/B077VYVBKP/</a><br /><br />If you would like to donate, visit us at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/besomethingwonderful,">https://paypal.me/besomethingwonderful,</a> or cash.app/$besomethingwonderful.
