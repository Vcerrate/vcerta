{% raw %}I have built a lot of things on the Dream SMP during the past 4 months. I built my Summer Home ( Temple of the Undying ), Kinoko Kingdom , HBomb94 mansion , Tubbo / Ranboo / Michael Mansion in Snowchester , and various other things. But my most infamous build comes from the chandelier in the Tubbo / Ranboo mansion. My first true insanity arc occurs while building it and I released all of frustration and anger onto Ranboo when he logs on. There was no shift dancing my way to happiness with this one...<br /><br />Ranboo Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/ranboolive">https://www.twitch.tv/ranboolive</a> <br />Ranboo YouTube: @Ranboo <br /><br />This comes from Foolish Gamers Vods and Ranboo Vods on Twitch while playing on the Dream SMP{% endraw %}
