And, for that…we have the almighty HIGH INTEREST SAVINGS ACCOUNT.  <br /><br />In addition to this…if you want a SLIGHTLY better return and don’t need the money immediately, you could consider Stable Coins. <br /><br />THIRD, I just want it in here, that if you have any high interest rate debt...like credit card debt….now is the time to pay that off, so you don’t accrue EVEN MORE interest that’ll make your situation worse than it needs to be. <br /><br />FOURTH, You’ll need to do your best to KEEP YOUR JOB, Take on side hustles, and CONTINUE WORKING, if at all possible. <br /><br />And FIFTH…once you’ve made sure your job is secure, your emergency fund is in place, and you’ve maximized how much money you’re making…you should begin consistently investing into the markets to buy the dip on a regular basis - no matter what happens.<br /><br />For business or one-on-one real estate investing/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com<br /><br />*This is a paid endorsement for Public.com.
