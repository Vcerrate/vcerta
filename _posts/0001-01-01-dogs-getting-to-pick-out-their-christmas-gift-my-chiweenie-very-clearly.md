{% raw %}My chiweenie very clearly has a preference for small toys. If it’s smaller than the palm of your hand, she loves it. Otherwise, meh. She also loves anything of a similar size. Small balls of yarn, stuffed keychains, etc.<br /><br />My cockapoo likes to rip toys apart limb from limb in the most psychotic fashion. He starts with the eyes, then nose, then limbs, then body. If he’s struggling with it, he will intentionally leave it outside to dry rot for several days before bringing it back in and trying again. So because he lives like that, we get him tough toys without squeakers or stuffing.<br /><br />I feel like my dogs definitely have their own unique preferences when it comes to toys and they definitely don’t like each other’s toys<br /><br />#Dogs #ChristmasGift #Christmas #Gift #Pets{% endraw %}
