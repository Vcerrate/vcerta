{% raw %}Composed by Kenji Ito.<br /><br /><br /><br />The theme of the Melancholy Man/Gloomy One, extended by me.  He's one of my favourite characters, but maybe that'll change once I get the game.  Highly unlikely, though!<br /><br /><br /><br />Link to the picture: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=21283865">http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=21283865</a>{% endraw %}
