He has used the principles and techniques that will be discussed &amp; explained to create multiple multi-million dollar companies, and is now teaching his principles for massive wealth creation to his students and mentees.<br /><br />ABOUT AS ABOVE SO BELOW<br />Hermeticists believe that there are certain universal, timeless truths (“the Perennial Wisdom”) which have always been, and will always be, accessible anyone through the powers of symbol, parable, analogy, myth and initiation. When one looks at today's new age and law of attraction teachers and communities, you find that what they teach or practice is all based upon the ancient practices of Hermeticism and the timeless, universal laws they study and use for practical use. The purpose of this channel is to close the gap between the so called occult and new age communities, but most importantly to teach practical techniques that may be used to manifest your own reality. <br /><br />Subjects that will be  explained will include: The Law of Attraction, The Seven Hermetic Principles, Magick &amp; The Occult, The Subconcious &amp; Superconcious Mind, Self-development, Magick, Astrology, Kabbalah &amp; Hermeticism and Entrepreneurship &amp; Business.<br /><br />#lawofattraction #hermeticprinciples #kybalion{% endraw %}
