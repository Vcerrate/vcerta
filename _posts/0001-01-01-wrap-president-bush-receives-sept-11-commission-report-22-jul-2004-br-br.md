President Bush walks out of White House with Kean and co-chair Lee Hamilton<br /><br />3. SOUNDBITE: (English) George W. Bush, US President:<br /><br />&quot;I want to thank these two gentlemen for serving their country so well and so admirably. They've done a really good job of learning about our country, learning about what went wrong prior to September 11th, and making very solid, sound recommendations about how to move forward. I assured them that where government needs to act, we will.&quot;<br /><br />4. Wide side shot of Bush speaking<br /><br />5. SOUNDBITE: (English) George W. Bush, US President:<br /><br />&quot;We in government have an obligation to do everything in our power to safeguard the American people. And the report that they are about to present to me puts out some very constructive recommendations. And I look forward to studying their recommendations and look forward to working with responsible parties within my administration to move forward on those recommendations.  As well, we look forward to working with the Congress on the implementation of ways to do our duty. And the most important duty we have is the security of our fellow countrymen.&quot;<br /><br />6.

And I thank you also on behalf of the commission for unprecedented access to documents and cooperation from your administration. We were able to see things that no commission or no member of Congress has ever seen in doing our work. And we thank you for allowing us to do that.&quot;<br /><br />8.

It's not the end of the process by any means but it is an important milestone and it is very gratifying, after struggling for almost three years, to get to this day, that we have this report now.&quot;<br /><br />(QUESTION) Inaudible<br /><br />&quot;We are only at the half-way point now. Now we have to get the recommendations implemented so that we can make sure that another 9-11 doesn't occur.&quot;<br /><br />13. SOUNDBITE: (English) Debra Burlingame, Sister of 9/11 Victim<br /><br />&quot;I  make this appeal to the leadership that they must not compromise when it comes to national security and they must not allow this to devolve into a partisan fight. There is a saying that politics stops at the water's edge. We now know that our enemies are amongst us and so the politics have to stop right here in Washington so that other families do not experience what we have experienced.&quot;<br /><br />14. Burlingame walks away<br /><br />STORYLINE:<br /><br />The chairmen of the 9/11 Commission hand-delivered their final report to US President George W. Bush on Thursday morning.<br /><br />The 500-plus page report concludes that a &quot;failure of imagination&quot; rather than governmental neglect allowed 19 hijackers to carry out the deadliest terrorist attack in US history. <br /><br />The panel criticises both the Bush and Clinton administrations - as well as the US Congress - for not doing enough to prevent al-Qaida's growing threat.<br /><br />But it reserves its harshest criticisms for the FBI and CIA, and calls for a massive intelligence overhaul, including a new central Director of Intelligence.<br /><br />But the president embraced its work on Thursday, insisting &quot;where government needs to act, (it) will.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Find out more about AP Archive: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork">http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork</a> <br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AP_Archive">https://twitter.com/AP_Archive</a> <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/APArchives">https://www.facebook.com/APArchives</a> ​​<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/APNews/">https://www.instagram.com/APNews/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />You can license this story through AP Archive: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/93fad22f0cbfef3111b384dd0ca6e8e2">http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/93fad22f0cbfef3111b384dd0ca6e8e2</a>{% endraw %}
