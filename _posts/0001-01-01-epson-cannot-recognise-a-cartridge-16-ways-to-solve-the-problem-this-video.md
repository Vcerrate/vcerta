{% raw %}This video explains the possible causes of the message &quot;Ink Cartridge Could Not Be Recognised&quot; and how you can resolve it.<br />Related to: <br />- EPSON Status Monitor reports &quot;Ink Cartridge Could Not Be Recognised&quot; or similar messages<br />- The red ink light remains on after replacing an ink cartridge.<br />- The printer is not recognising one or more ink cartridges.<br /><br />Be careful when you handle used ink cartridges, as there may be some ink around the ink supply port. If ink gets on your skin, wash the area thoroughly with soap and water. If ink gets into your eyes, flush them immediately with water. If discomfort or vision problems continue after a thorough flushing, see a doctor immediately.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Link Accessori srl <br />Via Beverara 224/7<br />40131 BOLOGNA (Italy)<br />www.linkaccessori.it<br />email: link.accessori@libero.it<br /><br />other links:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.emmegiricambi.it/">http://www.emmegiricambi.it/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.epson.com/">http://www.epson.com/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------{% endraw %}
