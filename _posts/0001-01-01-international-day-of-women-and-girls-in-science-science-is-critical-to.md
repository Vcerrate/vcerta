{% raw %}Science is critical to addressing the social and environmental challenges that confront us. The world needs science more than ever, and science needs everyone â€“ including women. <br /><br />Makes sense, right? And yet, according to the 2015 UNESCO Science Report, women account for only 28% of researchers across the world, and are even less represented at the higher echelons of decision-making. <br /><br />Women are interested and capable in STEM, so why such underrepresentation? Largely because of the persistence of gender stereotypes and biases. <br /><br />The Ontario Science Centre is adding its voice to International Day of Women and Girls in Science, advocating publicly for parity in science for women. <br /><br />Science needs women.{% endraw %}
