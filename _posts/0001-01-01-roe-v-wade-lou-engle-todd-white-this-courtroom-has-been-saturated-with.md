{% raw %}This courtroom has been saturated with prayer for decades. The reality of the prayers of the saints coming up over the years to overturn the ruling of Roe v. Wade is becoming visible. Don’t stop praying—plead the blood of Jesus over the Supreme Court of the United States and let’s pack the Courts of Heaven! Children are worth the price of the blood of Jesus. Let’s unleash revival!<br /><br />#roevwade #toddwhite #louengle <br /><br />Follow Todd White:<br />➢ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/ToddWhiteLC">http://www.facebook.com/ToddWhiteLC</a><br />➢ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/LCToddWhite">http://www.instagram.com/LCToddWhite</a><br /><br />Todd White was a drug addict and atheist for 22 years. In 2004 he was radically and miraculously set free when a gun fired at him and he should have died but instead heard God speak to his heart, “I took that bullet for you, now are you ready to live for me?”<br /> <br />Todd believes that redemption and righteousness are the foundational keys for living life as a new creation in Christ, and has since traveled the entire world sharing the gospel and living the full reality that Jesus paid for on the cross! Todd’s foremost desire is to see the Holy Spirit flowing through believers everywhere they go– work, school, grocery stores, malls, gas stations...everywhere! Todd’s true joy is being able to reproduce a 24/7 kingdom lifestyle in every believer. His heart is to activate people in the simplicity of who they really are and confront the barriers that hold them back from being who God created them to be.
