{% raw %}What are the worst places to live in England? England prides itself as the best of the 4 countries making up the UK. Granted, England is the home of London, the capital of the Kingdom. Nevertheless, it’s not everywhere in England that you’d love to live. And things may not be as good as they appear in pictures. There are terrible places to live in England also. Cultures in certain places may shock you while you’re still dazed in disbelief about the obnoxious attitude of some people. Here we present for your consideration, 10 worst places to live in England.<br />Oh! A quick one here: The listing here about the worst places to live in England represents just my personal opinion formed out of my own careful research and inputs from friends and acquaintances with firsthand information about these places in England. <br />10. Middlesbrough<br />Middlesbrough is a town in the North East of England located on the River Tees. It is an industrial town on the northeast coast which is definitely one of the 10 worst places to live in England and it has a lot of reasons to fight for on this list. Consider this: why does Middlesbrough always get bad press? <br />Many people consider it the worst place to be a girl in the country even though the die-hard residents will “explain” the drawbacks, rationalizing. The town that voted massively in favor of Brexit was reportedly pressured into cutting about 5,000 jobs from its steel industry over the last decade. <br /><br /><br /><br />Subscribe to my Channel: shorturl.at/lnC79<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://learningcanteen.com/">https://learningcanteen.com/</a><br /><br />✅ For business inquiries, contact me at olumayowaonline@yahoo.com<br /><br />----------Support my channel-------<br />Bitcoin:  1JvUtAS2MKJ3y9WghQmp9a9dKMxTfQUHhz<br />Doge Coin:  DLAiLVRAg3JrPiLxSwgcoBxgHzTg4Fq3W1<br />Ethereum:  0xdd897e1c8e76D90b343Aef1491fad93780890F82<br />Paypal: olumayowaonline@yahoo.com<br />Try Tubebuddy for free: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/learningcanteen">https://www.tubebuddy.com/learningcanteen</a><br /><br />Get stock footage for your videos: shorturl.at/gsEI6<br />SHOP THESE PRODUCTS<br />CAMERA: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/Fgse10">https://geni.us/Fgse10</a><br />Microphone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/ODhTrrQ">https://geni.us/ODhTrrQ</a><br />SD Card: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/VGukB">https://geni.us/VGukB</a><br />Vlogging Tripod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/cSgt">https://geni.us/cSgt</a><br />Studio lights: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/v2za">https://geni.us/v2za</a><br />Apple Airpods: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/3hIJA">https://geni.us/3hIJA</a><br />Travel Backpack: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3CtS3e7">https://amzn.to/3CtS3e7</a><br /><br />Books I recommend:<br />Rich Dad Poor Dad: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/ohZXit">https://geni.us/ohZXit</a><br />The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/6ua8">https://geni.us/6ua8</a><br />Dare to Lead: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/O5pvj">https://geni.us/O5pvj</a><br />The Intelligent Investor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/XO7sV">https://geni.us/XO7sV</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Links included in this description might be affiliate links.
