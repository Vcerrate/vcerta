{% raw %}On the 7th of October 2020, Adan hosted a webinar to present and analyze the two proposals for regulations applicable to digital assets published by the European Commission as part of its &quot;Digital Finance Package&quot;. While the first proposed regulation deals with cryptocurrencies, utility tokens and stablecoins (MiCA regulation for Markets in Crypto-Assets), the second describes a pilot scheme for &quot;DLT Market Infrastructures&quot; operating on security token markets.{% endraw %}
