{% raw %}Driving with an accompanying driver. In this video I discuss what it is usually like when driving with an accompanying driver. The things they usually neglect when driving in everyday life but are important for the exam, how they sometimes tell you to do the wrong things instead of the right ones, why they get impatient with your small mistakes, why they’re not the right person to show you some things even though they’re not necessarily bad drivers, and so on.<br /><br />For any info:<br />My website: www.conduitefacile.com<br />Gmail: conduitefacilevideos@gmail.com<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/conduitefacilevideos">https://www.facebook.com/conduitefacilevideos</a><br />Google+: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+ConduiteFacile">https://plus.google.com/+ConduiteFacile</a><br />Twitter:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ConduiteFacile">https://twitter.com/ConduiteFacile</a><br /><br />Note: While I try to make my videos as universal as possible, rules and laws may vary according to the place where you’re driving and might be different from the ones in this video. Always drive according to the laws and rules that apply to the place where you are driving. Requirements at the driving exam may also be different than the ones shown here. Always respect the requirements that apply to the place where you are passing your driving exam. The distances illustrated in this video might vary depending on the driver’s height, the size and type of the vehicle and so on. This video is not legal advice, and is not meant to replace your official driving courses.
