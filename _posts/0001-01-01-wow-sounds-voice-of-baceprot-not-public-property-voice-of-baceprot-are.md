{% raw %}Voice of Baceprot are back! For 2022, the mind blowing all-girl metal band from Indonesia are WOW London Festival's first ever digital Artist in Residence. To celebrate International Women's Day, we are proud to premiere their new single, [NOT] PUBLIC PROPERTY,  a brand new anthem to empower women and girls around the world. Inspired by WOW, the track explores the right to bodily autonomy - a right so often cast aside, particularly in the cases of women. With thanks to British Council Indonesia for supporting WOW's Artist in Residence programme. <br /><br />This is the first song to be written by the members of VOB without the aid of their mentor and former teacher Abah Erza, who played a significant role in encouraging the formation of the band. Starting out by performing covers of their idols, VOB have since developed their own sound that incorporates their various influences - ranging from rock, rap-rock and funk rock to nu-metal and funk metal, meshing them into a unique style of rock music furnished with frontwoman Marsya’s virtuoso guitar riffs and distinct vocals, drummer Sitti’s hard-thumping, blast-beating beats and Widi’s trademark bass slaps. <br /><br />WOW Sounds is WOW’s dedicated music programme, platforming revolutionary women, girls and non-binary musicians who are using their music as a form of activism to create change in their local communities.<br /><br />Follow WOW at: <br />Twitter: @WOWisGlobal <br />Facebook: womenoftheworldfestival<br />Instagram: @wowglobal{% endraw %}
