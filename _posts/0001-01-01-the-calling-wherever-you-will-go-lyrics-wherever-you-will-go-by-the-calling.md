{% raw %}♫ Wherever You Will Go by The Calling<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />So lately, been wondering<br />Who will be there to take my place<br />When I'm gone, you'll need love<br />To light the shadows on your face<br /><br />If a great wave shall fall<br />It'd fall upon us all<br />And between the sand and stone<br />Could you make it on your own?<br /><br />If I could, then I would<br />I'll go wherever you will go<br />Way up high or down low<br />I'll go wherever you will go<br /><br />And maybe, I'll find out<br />The way to make it back someday<br />To watch you, to guide you<br />Through the darkest of your days<br /><br />If a great wave shall fall<br />It'd fall upon us all<br />Well, then I hope there's someone out there<br />Who can bring me back to you<br /><br />If I could, then I would<br />I'll go wherever you will go<br />Way up high or down low<br />I'll go wherever you will go<br /><br />Run away with my heart<br />Run away with my hope<br />Run away with my love<br /><br />I know now, just quite how<br />My life and love might still go on<br />In your heart, in your mind<br />I'll stay with you for all of time<br /><br />If I could, then I would<br />I'll go wherever you will go<br />Way up high or down low<br />I'll go wherever you will go<br /><br />If I could turn back time<br />I'll go wherever you will go<br />If I could make you mine<br />I'll go wherever you will go<br /><br />I'll go wherever you will go<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />©2001.
