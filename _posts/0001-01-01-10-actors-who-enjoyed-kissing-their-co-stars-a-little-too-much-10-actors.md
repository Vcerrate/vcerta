The series is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer Television, DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Television. The series revolves around Lucifer Morningstar (Tom Ellis), the Devil, who abandons Hell for Los Angeles where he runs his own nightclub and becomes a consultant to the LAPD. The ensemble and supporting cast include Lauren German as Detective Chloe Decker, Kevin Alejandro as Detective Daniel &quot;Dan&quot; Espinoza, D. B. Woodside as Amenadiel, Lesley-Ann Brandt as Mazikeen, and Rachael Harris as Dr. Linda Martin. Filming took place primarily in Vancouver, British Columbia before production was relocated entirely to Los Angeles, California beginning with the third season. The first season received mixed reviews from critics, though subsequent seasons were better rated. The fourth season also received high ratings and critical acclaim. Many critics particularly praised Ellis' performance. Despite initially high viewership for its debut, ratings remained consistently low throughout the series' run on Fox. On May 11, 2018, Fox cancelled Lucifer after three seasons. A month later, Netflix picked up the series for a fourth season of ten episodes, which was released on May 8, 2019. On June 6, 2019, Netflix renewed the series for the fifth and final season which will be 16 episodes. However, in March 2020, Tom Ellis and other stars of the show were reported to have signed up for a sixth season to be produced by Netflix and Warner Bros.[4] Official confirmation is yet to be received. It was later reported that production has stopped near to the end of Season 5 due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and studio closures.
