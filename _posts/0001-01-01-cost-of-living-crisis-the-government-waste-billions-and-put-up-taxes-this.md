{% raw %}This video should make you very angry. Whilst the biggest cost of living crisis approaches the government wastes billions through incompetence and mismanagement. The Bounce Back Loan scheme designed to help businesses survive the pandemic involved lending out $47 billion without any checks and with the government guaranteeing all loans. Already £4.9 billion has been written off due to fraud. The buying of PPE at the start of the pandemic was a disaster with friends of Tory politicians with no experience of buying PPE being given priority. The NHS calculates that the cost of some PPE being unsuitable, some being unusable and some out of date as well as much that was sold at twice the normal price, the cost to them has been as much as £20 billion. £7 million per week is being spent on storage and much of the stock is being incinerated. The test &amp; trace for which £37 billion was budgeted appears to have been as good as useless and confirmed by the Public Accounts Committee.{% endraw %}
