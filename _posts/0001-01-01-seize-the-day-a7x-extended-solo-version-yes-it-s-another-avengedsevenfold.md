{% raw %}Yes, it's another @avengedsevenfold cover and yet, I think this one came out way better than the last one. I found this version on YouTube by the great @cacabarrosoficial and it was amazing how I felt when I listened to it. I had to cover it and added a few things of my own at the end of the video. Give me your opinion, how does it sound? <br /><br /><br />Let me know what my next cover should be. 😄<br /><br />original version cover: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/VYHltb_0g3o">https://youtu.be/VYHltb_0g3o</a><br /><br />Take care. 🤘🙏<br /><br />Instagram: www.instagram.com/joaohudsonmusic{% endraw %}
