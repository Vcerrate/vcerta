{% raw %}hey friends...where i've been the past 6 months :') still in shock tbh<br /><br />all the schools i applied to (appeared in order of decision date)<br />ut austin<br />harvard<br />cu boulder<br />university of virginia<br />mit<br />princeton<br />brown<br />columbia<br />dartmouth<br />harvard (again LOL)<br />yale<br />stanford<br /><br />i think it's important to keep in mind that college decisions (especially this year) were absolutely brutal and i personally know SO many wildly talented applicants who were rejected. <br /><br />COLLEGE DECISIONS DO NOT DEFINE YOU AS A PERSON!!!! for those who got rejected: you are hardworking, talented, and so worthy regardless of what an impersonal letter says. <br /><br />✩ SOCIAL ✩<br />-instagram: @debbiebongg (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/debbiebongg​)">https://instagram.com/debbiebongg​)</a><br />-vsco: @ddebbiebongg (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vsco.co/debbiebongg/images/1​)">https://vsco.co/debbiebongg/images/1​)</a><br />-tiktok: @debbiebongg<br />-sticker shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lumierehandmade.etsy.com​">https://lumierehandmade.etsy.com​</a><br />-email: hello@debbiebong.com<br /><br />disclaimer | this video was not sponsored<br />music<br />Goosetaf - Bumblebee - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thmatc.co/?l=4C84837E">https://thmatc.co/?l=4C84837E</a><br />Naomi - Saturday Light - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thmatc.co/?l=D50977D2">https://thmatc.co/?l=D50977D2</a><br />Sonic Nothing - Blush - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thmatc.co/?l=7EA61DDA">https://thmatc.co/?l=7EA61DDA</a><br />like and subscribe if u want :)<br />xoxo,<br />debbie{% endraw %}
