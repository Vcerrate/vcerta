{% raw %}This video is inspired by MrBeast. Check his channel out, and tell him to check out this video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBeast6000">https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBeast6000</a><br />During the 20th century, the Soviet Union and the United States competed in a race for space superiority, nowadays known as &quot;The Space Race&quot;.<br />The Soviet Union was the first one to send a satellite to space with the Sputnik 1, and the first one to send the first man to space: Yuri Garagin. This created uneasiness in the United States, as people thought this meant the Soviet Union would control the world. Thus, the government started funding a program to send the first man to the Moon. In 1969, they achieved this and won the Space Race with the Apollo 11 mission, where Neil Armstrong first set foot on the Moon.<br />We hope you enjoy this MrBeast animation.<br /><br />Join our secret epic membership for perks.
