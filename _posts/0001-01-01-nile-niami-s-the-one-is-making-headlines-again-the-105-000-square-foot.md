With 21 bedrooms, 49 bathrooms, 7 swimming pools, a movie theater, a night club, a hair salon, and many other amenities, The One is unlike any other mega mansion in the world. The home is the most expensive residential real estate listing in America, priced at $295 million dollars. The home was originally rumored to ask $500 million dollars, but there has been a drop in price after Aaron Kirman, Branden Williams, Rayni Williams, and concierge auctions got involved. Nile Niami's bankruptcy stalled the auction sale of The One temporarily, but it appears that hurdle has since passed as the auction is scheduled for later this month.<br /><br />See you next video! <br /><br />-Scott <br /><br />#nileniami #theone<br /><br />Disclaimer: This channel, and any communication shared during these videos, should not be taken as financial or legal advice.
