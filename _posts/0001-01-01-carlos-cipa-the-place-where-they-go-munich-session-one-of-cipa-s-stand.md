{% raw %}One of Cipa’s stand-out pieces, this is a delicate, sensitive piano song, with a plain, simple melody that grows into a polyrhythmic pattern structure while never losing its melodic yet melancholic mood. It feels as if we are on a journey to another place, on a transition into another period of our life, never fully realising that we have become someone new. Carlos played the grand piano D-232 from the piano manufacturers Steingraeber in Bayreuth, Germany. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.steingraeber.de​">http://www.steingraeber.de​</a><br /><br /><br /><br />SOCIALS: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/carloscipa/​">https://www.instagram.com/carloscipa/​</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/CarlosCipaMusic">https://www.youtube.com/CarlosCipaMusic</a><br />​<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/carloscipa/">https://www.facebook.com/carloscipa/</a><br />​<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/carloscipa">https://linktr.ee/carloscipa</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@carloscipa">https://www.tiktok.com/@carloscipa</a>{% endraw %}
