{% raw %}An introduction to conditional probability, pitched at a level appropriate for a typical introductory statistics course.   I work through some simple examples in this introductory video, and a I briefly touch on the concept of independence in an example at the end of the video.  I work through more examples (some a little harder) in my conditional probability example problems video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ES9HFNDu4Bs.">https://youtu.be/ES9HFNDu4Bs.</a>{% endraw %}
