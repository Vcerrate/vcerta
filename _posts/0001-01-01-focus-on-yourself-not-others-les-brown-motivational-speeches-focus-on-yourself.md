{% raw %}FOCUS ON YOURSELF NOT OTHERS | Les Brown Motivational Speeches<br />“The graveyard is the richest place on earth, because it is here that you will find all the hopes and dreams that were never fulfilled, the books that were never written, the songs that were never sung, the inventions that were never shared, the cures that were never discovered, all because someone was too afraid to take that first step, keep with the problem, or determined to carry out their dream.”<br />― Les Brown<br />“The things you want are always possible; it is just that the way to get them is not always apparent. The only real obstacle in your path to a fulfilling life is you, and that can be a considerable obstacle because you carry the baggage of insecurities and past experience.”<br />― Les Brown<br /><br />Speakers:<br />Les Brown <br />tom Bilyeu<br />Lisa nichols<br />Brian Tracy<br /><br />Les Brown<br />Visit Les Brown' websites:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lesbrown.com/">https://www.lesbrown.com/</a><br /><br /><br />Follow Tony Robbins @:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/lesbrown">https://www.facebook.com/lesbrown</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/lesbrown">https://twitter.com/lesbrown</a><br />Google+: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+lesbrown">https://plus.google.com/+lesbrown</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/lesbrown/">https://instagram.com/lesbrown/</a><br /><br /><br />Footage<br />All Video Footage licensed through Videoblocksm Filmpac and Artgrid.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artgrid.io/">https://artgrid.io/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.videoblocks.com">https://www.videoblocks.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Filmpac.com">https://Filmpac.com</a><br /><br />Music <br />Really Slow Motion <br />Borrtex<br /><br />Buy Really Slow Motion music<br />Amazon : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/1lTltY5">http://amzn.to/1lTltY5</a><br />iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1ee3l8K">http://bit.ly/1ee3l8K</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1r3lPvN">http://bit.ly/1r3lPvN</a><br />Bandcamp: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1DqtZSo">http://bit.ly/1DqtZSo</a><br /><br />Music - Borrtex<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://borrtex.com/">https://borrtex.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Borrtex/">https://www.facebook.com/Borrtex/</a><br /><br />LICENSE CERTIFICATE: Envato Elements Item<br />=================================================<br />This license certificate documents a license to use the item listed below<br />on a non-exclusive, commercial, worldwide and revokable basis, for<br />one Single Use for this Registered Project.<br /><br />Item Title:                      Cinematic Ambient Piano<br />Item ID:                         GAWF2HZ<br />Author Username:                 Enrize<br />Registered Project Name:    TheMotivation<br />License Date:                    January 21st, 2020<br />Item License Code:               3NPVSLYUMZ<br /><br />►Copyright disclaimer:<br />We own commercial licenses and permissions for all the content used in this video except parts about the topic that have been used under fair use.{% endraw %}
