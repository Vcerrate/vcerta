No Limits Episode 6 is here!!! The girls started off with a game against Windward. They had a couple of really tough players so this was finna be a great game. They got up big early- but Windward started to close the gap once Breya came out. Their post player started going OFF! Luckily Breya came back in and the girls were able to come away with the dub. Then we went with Breya to her training session. Gotta get the body right for playoffs! Jada pulled up for some moral support while Breya was doing some recovery. Idk about that laughing through pain thing though. Then we went to the DMV with Taj for her drivers test! A couple bumps in the road but she passed and got her license!!! Then we went to Breya's crib and met the fam. All of her fam hoops so we got a mean game of horse going! Even Pops got into it! Then we had another tough game vs The Bishop School! This was for the conference championship!! It was senior night too so the girls had to show up! But they got off to a rough start- they couldn't hit anything. Meanwhile, Mikey pulled up in a Lambo truck to watch Jada and the gang ball out. The girls really couldn't figure it out tho- T-Bam really got on them at half. Jada and Breya were not happy with how the game was going- do y'all think they can pull off the dub???<br /><br />Drop a comment below if you're messing with the series so far!!
