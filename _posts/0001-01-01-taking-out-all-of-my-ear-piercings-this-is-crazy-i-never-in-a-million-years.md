{% raw %}I never in a million years thought I would do this! In today's video I am removing ALL of my ear piercings! WHAT?! But the question is, is this permanent? Have I moved on my from my piercing obsession? NO WAY! I wanted to record myself removing all of my ear piercings, give them a good clean, and then put them all back in. This was so fun, stressful, scary, and interesting all at the same time! Glad I did this! What do you guys think about this? Isn't this weird?! Share all your thoughts down in the comments and give this video a thumbs up before you go! xoxo<br /><br />↓↓OPEN ME↓↓<br />WATCH IN 1080p HD!<br /><br />#breeannmarie #bodyjewelry #earpiercings<br /><br />❤MY SOCIAL MEDIA!<br />♡Facebook Fanpage: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BreeAnnxMarie/">https://www.facebook.com/BreeAnnxMarie/</a><br />♡Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/breeannxmarie/">https://www.instagram.com/breeannxmarie/</a> Or @breeannxmarie<br />♡My Dog's Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jackyl_and_avril/">https://www.instagram.com/jackyl_and_avril/</a> Or @Jackyl_and_Avril<br />♡Snap Chat: littleb893<br />♡Twitter: @BreeAnnB893<br /><br />BUSINESS E-MAIL ONLY (Please do NOT contact me about piercing questions!): breeann.streng@gmail.com <br /><br />FTC Disclaimer-None of the products, businesses, or companies mentioned or used in this video are sponsoring me or paying me to use them in any way, shape, or form.
