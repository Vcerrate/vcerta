He may seem cold-blooded and evil, but he actually wants to get close to others and become their friends. He has OCD and a complete neat freak! You may see him and his sidekick KongKong get up to no good, but he's a good soul really!<br /><br />Frankie is a bit of a dull slowpoke, Frankie's appetite sometimes turns him into a bit of a monster! He grows a four-leaf clover on top of his head which is lucky charm. He's one of the kindest members of the Spookiz gang, but his appetite sometimes puts him in a foul mood if he is not full up!<br /><br />Kebi is a free-minded soul and isn't one to stick to rules and formality. He's constantly energetic and bubbly and loves to tease Cula as much as he can. It is a friendly rivalry though as they truly are best buddies!<br /><br />KongKong is Cula's sidekick KongKong is best described as weak to the strong and strong to the weak. He's very self conscious about his short height but by listening and trusting in Cula he feels safe and comforted.<br /><br />Zizi shows gives off a stinking odour but she does not realise it. Body parts (mainly her head) often fall apart off her body, but are always easily placed back together on her. She has a secret crush on Cula and dreams of being with him always. She's incredibly shy around him and doesn't like anyone to know this.<br /><br />► Visit our Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/spookizworld">http://www.facebook.com/spookizworld</a><br />► Visit Our Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/spookizworld">http://www.twitter.com/spookizworld</a><br />► Brought to you by Keyring Studios: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.keyringstudio.com">http://www.keyringstudio.com</a><br /><br />#spookiz #spookizcartoon #spookizepisodes #kidscartoons #spookizmovie{% endraw %}
