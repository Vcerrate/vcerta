{% raw %}Fun Fact; back when these bins were new in the sixties, they probably only cost $2000 each to build. If you came here to see big money being spent, you're in the wrong place. We are all about savings and doing the work ourselves with what's available. I don't have an exact total on the parts to fix these two bins, but  I think my title is close ish. I have been collecting bin pieces for four years now.  Two of the three bins haven't been properly used in 10+ years, so I'm going to make them functional. Stay tuned for the wild adventure of making one of these hold ear corn. Last year, you saw the first bin get it's makeover with a new unload auger. If you didn't, link will appear in video.{% endraw %}
