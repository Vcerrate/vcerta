{% raw %}Welcome back to my channel San Joaquin Junior. Today I will be going over a video from FLS Family. In todays video two Billings police officers come up and want to search an innocent woman’s car. Their reasoning for this is that they suspect the vehicle to be involved in an apparent shooting. Problem here is that instead of searching for the suspect they instead try to search through a vehicle. Im sure if there was a shooting then there was someone who had to see the suspect and get information as to what he or she looked like. Regardless of all that, a warrant needs to be issued in order for the police to go ahead and search the vehicle against the owner’s wishes. The owner of the vehicle gets his phone out to record himself confronting the police, and this is what happened next.<br /><br />@FLS Family <br /><br />#police #freedom #freedom{% endraw %}
