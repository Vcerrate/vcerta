{% raw %}Microservices are a hot topic in system design interviews. It is important to know why we use them instead of monolithic systems. The short answer is: Scalability. The detailed one would be:<br /><br />Advantages:<br />1) The microservice architecture is easier to reason about/design for a complicated system.<br />2) They allow new members to train for shorter periods and have less context before touching a system.<br />3) Deployments are fluid and continuous for each service.<br />4) They allow decoupling service logic on the basis of business responsibility<br />5) They are more available as a single service having a bug does not bring down the entire system. This is called a single point of failure.<br />6) Individual services can be written in different languages.<br />7) The developer teams can talk to each other through API sheets instead of working on the same repository, which requires conflict resolution.<br />8) New services can be tested easily and individually. The testing structure is close to unit testing compared to a monolith.<br /><br />Microservices are at a disadvantage to Monoliths in some cases. Monoliths are favorable when:<br />1) The technical/developer team is very small<br />2) The service is simple to think of as a whole.<br />3) The service requires very high efficiency, where network calls are avoided as much as possible.<br />4) All developers must have context of all services.<br /><br />Recommended system design video course: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://get.interviewready.io">https://get.interviewready.io</a><br /><br />Along with video lectures, this course has architecture diagrams, capacity planning, API contracts and evaluation tests.
