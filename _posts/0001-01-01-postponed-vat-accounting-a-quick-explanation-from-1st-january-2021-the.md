{% raw %}From 1st January 2021 the VAT rules in the UK are changing.<br /><br />Following Brexit and the transition period which ended on 31st December 2020, purchase of goods from EU countries are now classed as imports.<br /><br />Previously VAT on imports had to be paid up-front before release from Customs which would result in a negative cash flow impact for businesses.  To avoid this, HMRC have set up the Postponed VAT Accounting scheme.<br /><br />PVA is optional and you don't have to apply to use, but you do need to make it clear on your custom's documentation.  And to access your monthly statement you need to sign up for the Customs Declaration Service (CDS) if you are not already using it for importing.<br /><br />In this video I try to explain as simply as possible what it’s all about.<br /><br />Look out for more post-Brexit VAT videos coming soon.<br /><br />******<br />📘 HELPFUL LINKS 📘<br /><br />HMRC information on Postponed VAT Accounting<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-when-you-can-account-for-import-vat-on-your-vat-return">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-when-you-can-account-for-import-vat-on-your-vat-return</a><br /><br />Get an EORI number for the movement of goods (Economic Operators Registration and Identification number)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/eori">https://www.gov.uk/eori</a><br /><br />Get access to the Customs Declaration Service<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-access-to-the-customs-declaration-service">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-access-to-the-customs-declaration-service</a><br /><br />******<br /><br />📚 OTHER RESOURCES 📚<br /><br />If you need further help with Xero, then have a look at these resources:<br /><br />🤹🏼‍♀️  Our friendly Facebook Group for UK Xero users <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ukxerosupporthub">https://www.facebook.com/groups/ukxerosupporthub</a><br /><br />🎓 Join 5,000 students on one of my online Xero courses<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/user/marion-thomson/">https://www.udemy.com/user/marion-thomson/</a><br /><br />👩🏻‍🏫  Need 1-2-1 support from a qualified accountant with over 9 years Xero experience?  <br />I'm available for 1 hour online coaching by Zoom<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=14206562">https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=14206562</a>{% endraw %}
