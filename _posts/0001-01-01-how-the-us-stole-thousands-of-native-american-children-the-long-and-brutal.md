{% raw %}The long and brutal history of the US trying to “kill the Indian and save the man”.<br /><br />Help our reporting on hidden histories. Submit a story idea here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy">http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy</a><br /><br />Toward the end of the 19th century, the US took thousands of Native American children and enrolled them in off-reservation boarding schools, stripping them of their cultures and languages. Yet decades later as the US phased out the schools, following years of indigenous activism, it found a new way to assimilate Native American children: promoting their adoption into white families. Watch the episode to find out how these two distinct eras in US history have had lasting impacts on Native American families.<br /><br />In the Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present. Join her as she covers the histories that are often left out of our textbooks. Our first season tackles stories of racial injustice, political conflicts, even the hidden history of US medical experimentation.<br /><br />Have an idea for a story that Ranjani should investigate for Missing Chapter?
