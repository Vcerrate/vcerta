{% raw %}21 days of relaxing hiking on the Manaslu Circuit, through the Nepal Himalayas, close to Tibet and Annapurna. Join my friend Hung and I on our trek through narrow valleys, along rushing rivers, and over majestic mountains. Rest with us at a Tibetan monastery, go hiking with dogs, goats, yaks, and donkeys, and experience authentic Tibetan and Nepalese life. Trek was in December 2021.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nicholaseager.com/">https://nicholaseager.com/</a><br />Gear: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kit.co/nicholas.eager/hiking-photography-kit">https://kit.co/nicholas.eager/hiking-photography-kit</a><br /><br />---<br /><br />Prayer flags sending wishes in the wind with every thread, sunsets setting fire to the mountains, cheery nuns cooking nourishing treats over a crackling fire, energetic monks playing football over a cliff, loyal dogs guiding lost trekkers along the trail, squeaky prayer wheels spinning endlessly, furry yaks eying strange non-furry humans curiously from afar, swaying bridges hanging high above rushing teal-colored rivers, weary donkeys hauling heavy supplies, shoes sinking abruptly into the snow, majestic mountain goats strutting across the field, milk tea melting treacherously frozen lakes, all powered by Dal Bhat ðŸ˜‹<br /><br />There were countless little beautiful moments on this trip. We went during the off-season, which primarily meant cold and snow. But it also meant empty tea houses and every opportunity to sit in the kitchens while the tea house owners cooked us dinner, and made a roaring fire with equally warming conversation (most of which we couldnâ€™t understand as it was in Tibetan ðŸ˜„).<br /><br />---<br /><br />0:00:00 - Intro<br />0:01:00 - Day 0: Transportation to Sotikhola<br />0:01:45 - Day 1: Sotikhola to Machhakhola (14km / 440m)<br />0:03:02 - Day 2: Machhakhola to Jagat (17km / 760m)<br />0:07:11 - Day 3: Jagat to Deng (20km / 1000m)<br />0:10:27 - Day 4: Deng to Syarang Gumba Monastery (18km / 1900m)<br />0:13:36 - Day 5-8: Rest at Syarang Gumba Monastery<br />0:18:07 - Day 9: Syarang Gumba Monastery to Prok (13km / 1400m)<br />0:20:28 - Day 10: Prok to Lhi (13km / 800m)<br />0:23:40 - Day 11: Lhi to Shyala (9km / 640m)<br />0:27:01 - Day 12: Shylya to Samagaon (4km / 69m)<br />0:29:16 - Day 13-14: Rest at Samagaon, Birendra Lake, and Manaslu Base Camp (10km / 1300m)<br />0:33:32 - Day 15: Samagaon to Samdo (8km / 350m)<br />0:33:55 - Day 16: Samdo to Larka Pass Viewpoint to Samdo (22km / 2000m)<br />0:36:42 - Day 17-21: Return from Samdo to Sotikhola (102km / 4200m)<br /><br />---<br /><br />Music:<br /><br />Ethereal Relaxation by Kevin MacLeod<br />Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/8719-ethereal-relaxation">https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/8719-ethereal-relaxation</a><br />License: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://filmmusic.io/standard-license">https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</a><br /><br />Artifact by Kevin MacLeod<br />Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3382-artifact">https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3382-artifact</a><br />License: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://filmmusic.io/standard-license">https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</a><br /><br />Gymnopedie No. 1 by Kevin MacLeod<br />Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3837-gymnopedie-no-1">https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3837-gymnopedie-no-1</a><br />License: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://filmmusic.io/standard-license">https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</a><br /><br />Touching Moments Two - Higher by Kevin MacLeod<br />Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4539-touching-moments-two---higher">https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4539-touching-moments-two---higher</a><br />License: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://filmmusic.io/standard-license">https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</a><br /><br />Ambiant Relax Sounds - Zakhar Valaha Music<br />Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pixabay.com/music/ambient-ambiant-relax-sounds-10621/">https://pixabay.com/music/ambient-ambiant-relax-sounds-10621/</a><br />License: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pixabay.com/service/terms/#license">https://pixabay.com/service/terms/#license</a>{% endraw %}
