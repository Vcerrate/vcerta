{% raw %}#diamonds #jewelry #valentinesday<br />$100 Million in Diamonds... Should I buy them?<br /><br />There is only one person I trust when it comes to ice and that's my friend David Rosenberg. This guy literally started from nothing, to owning and operating his own gem business. He has the best quality and largest rocks in the market today... And he owns his own inventory. Today I have him in the studio to show me some of his museum quality ice. I know Elena is watching... I'd love to know in comments below... Should I get @Elena Cardone a nice Valentines Day Gift? ; )<br /><br />If you are thinking about getting something nice for your special someone, the only person I would ever recommend would be my good friend David Rosenberg at Rosenberg Diamonds &amp; Co.<br /><br />He is the best.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rosenbergdiamonds.com">https://rosenbergdiamonds.com</a><br /><br />- GC{% endraw %}
