{% raw %}I'm fighting iDubbbz in my professional boxing debut Saturday May 14th! Tickets for the in person event and stream here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thecreatorclash.com/">https://thecreatorclash.com/</a><br /><br />The United States Food and Drug Administration does a great job ensuring everything we put into our bodies is safe, and while that might be true, it may still come as a surprise to learn there are some &quot;interesting&quot; things they allow to slip through. You see, there are all sorts of unsavory things that make their way into our food throughout the crowing, harvesting, and shipping process, that are unfortunately impossible to prevent. Fortunately, the FDA has identified the volume of these things we can allow to slip through the cracks and still not suffer any consequences. We're talking bugs, animal hair, cigarette butts, parasitic cysts! Yuck. Which of these things surprised you the most?<br /><br />Read more about the FDA's process here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredients-additives-gras-packaging-guidance-documents-regulatory-information/food-defect-levels-handbook">https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredients-additives-gras-packaging-guidance-documents-regulatory-information/food-defect-levels-handbook</a><br /><br />Special thanks to LiveScience for this great article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.livescience.com/55459-fda-acceptable-food-defects.html">https://www.livescience.com/55459-fda-acceptable-food-defects.html</a><br /><br />I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously.
