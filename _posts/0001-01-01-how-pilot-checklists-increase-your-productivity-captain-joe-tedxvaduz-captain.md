{% raw %}Captain Joe explains how you can dramatically increase your productivity by enhancing your everyday To-Do-List into a PILOT’S CHECKLIST, you want to complete! <br /><br />Flying as an airline pilot for the past 12 years, Joe has learned first-hand how powerful checklists are in an aircraft cockpit environment. Overtime he implemented more and more self-made checklists in his everyday life, increasing his productivity, discipline, focus and ultimately achieved more success. What works for a million flights every day, must work in your everyday life!<br /><br />With his talk, he wants to share his methods on how to set up your own checklist for success, every day!<br /><br />This talk is part of a TEDx Vaduz, „be small, THINK BIG“ which took place in Vaduz/Liechtenstein on the 21.08.2021. <br /><br />TED motivation, captain joe TED talk, captain joe checklists, captain joe, how to become a better person, checklists, procrastination, self help, how to write a to-do-list, how to write a checklist, what can we learn from pilots, discipline, focus, success, Pilot explains, pilot ted talk, tedx vaduz, self improvement, task management, self-discipline My love for aviation started at a very young age when my parents dropped me off at the airport terminal with a UM bag (unaccompanied minor) around my neck. A lovely flight attendant would then pick me up and take care of me during my flight right until my grandparents or my godfather picked me up at the arrivals gate at London Heathrow. At that time, my godfather used to work for London radar as an air traffic controller and that enabled me to witness a Boeing 747 or Concorde take-off, near the runways of Heathrow. Once the Concorde was airborne and the vibrating ground had calmed, I said to myself: &quot;This is what I want to do for a living!&quot; <br />My goal is to become a motivational speaker and share the knowledge from my experience as a pilot with my audience and how they can apply procedures/checklists pilots use in the cockpit to their everyday life! This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
