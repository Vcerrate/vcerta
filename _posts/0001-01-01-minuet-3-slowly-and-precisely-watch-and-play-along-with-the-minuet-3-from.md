{% raw %}Watch and play along with the Minuet 3 from Suzuki Book 1 in slow tempo with precise bow division and  &quot;beginners technique&quot;, i.e. without vibrato and other more advanced techniques, so you can focus on the basics!  <br /><br />The slurs are played with portato or &quot;push strokes&quot; as a preparation for precise bow division of the slurs.  This way, your slurs will sound more beautiful!<br /><br />If you dont have strips on your own bow, it can be helpful to put some on, or use chalk to divide the bow into four even parts so that you can copy a precise bow distribution:-) <br /><br />A video like this can be very helpful, but remember that it can never replace your teacher.  Please always follow your teachers advice, as even within the Suzuki program, the teachers playing and instruction can vary slightly from one another and this should by no means confuse you!  Always confirm with your teacher as he/she knows how to help you best! <br /><br />Thank you for watching, keep up the good practice and sending you love and light!<br /><br />Also, check out Violin Garden Summer Academy Vienna, Austria a five day Suzuki program in Palace Miller-Aichholz in the outskirts of imperial Vienna.<br />More information at www.violingarden.com{% endraw %}
