{% raw %}&quot;Hello, and welcome to my channel. This is a space for study enthusiasts and tea drinkers, and those who spend hours ambling around libraries and book shops. I hope that my videos can provide motivation and encourage you to be productive, but without feeding into Hustle Culture. I think productivity is all about enjoying what we do, and finding time for things that bring us happiness or will bring us happiness in the future -- and I hope to celebrate this kind of living on my channel&quot;.<br /><br />🎃 I run a small stationery company called Pumpkin Productivity where I design and sell planning and organisation products for students. I use these myself &amp; the planners are made with recycled paper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3wgsR85">https://bit.ly/3wgsR85</a><br /><br />😊 Instagram - @_rubygranger<br />✉️ Business Enquiries: rubygranger@sixteenth.co<br />📚 Goodreads: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2JKD4nM">http://bit.ly/2JKD4nM</a> (see what I'm reading!)<br /><br />MY BOOK: ‘Erimentha Parker’s To Do List’ is a middle-grade book about bullying. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3mdJKLm">https://amzn.to/3mdJKLm</a><br /><br />FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:<br />😇 How old are you? 21<br />📝 What are you studying?
