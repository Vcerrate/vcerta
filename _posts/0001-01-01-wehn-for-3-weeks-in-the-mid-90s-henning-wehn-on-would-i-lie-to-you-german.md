{% raw %}German Comedy Ambassador Henning Wehn's compilation. <br />00:13 - For three weeks, I was listed as a missing person by Interpol.  <br />07:14 - For three weeks, I carted an empty box around without realising that what I'd bought wasn't actually in it.   <br />11:55 - This is Nicola, and I told my parents to sack her as my baby-sitter because she failed to read my bedtime stories with enough emotion.  <br />14:49 - This is Bill. I once bought an Irish accent mouth spray from him, 'cos I genuinely believed it would give me an Irish accent.   <br />20:09 - I was once arrested by border guards for illegally entering another country.<br /><br />A huge thanks to the people who contributed the Swedish and Dutch subtitles for the entire compilation!{% endraw %}
