{% raw %}MERCH DROP WAITING LIST: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://forms.gle/7H6Jedp7cngPxVQM8">https://forms.gle/7H6Jedp7cngPxVQM8</a><br /><br />Rocky is one of the most iconic movies of all time. Along with winning best picture for new-coming writer, director, and actor, Sylvester Stallone, in 1976, the film inspired 5 sequels and the spinoff film series “Creed” starring Michael B. Jordan. As an up and coming boxer myself, I thought I’d take a look at the work of Rocky Balboa to see if he included medical accuracy in his boxing epic based out of Philadelphia. Carl Weathers playing Apollo Creed, Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago… not to mention Mickey, Adrian, Paulie, and so many other characters come into play here as we look at the injuries Rocky sustained and delivered. Specifically we look into broken hands, broken noses, broken ribs, brain trauma and CTE, drinking raw eggs, using raw meat as punching bags, running stairs, “cut-men” steroids, blood doping, hematomas, chasing a chicken for speed training, banning boxing, Cavum Septum Pellucidum, Which Rocky movie is your favorite?<br /><br />COME SEE ME ON TOUR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.doctormikelive.com">http://www.doctormikelive.com</a><br /><br />I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously.
