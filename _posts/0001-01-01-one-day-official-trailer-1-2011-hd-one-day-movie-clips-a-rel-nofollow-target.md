She is a working-class girl of principle and ambition who dreams of making the world a better place. He is a wealthy charmer who dreams that the world will be his playground. For the next two decades, key moments of their relationship are experienced over several July 15ths in their lives. Together and apart, we see Dex and Em through their friendship and fights, hopes and missed opportunities, laughter and tears. Somewhere along their journey, these two people realize that what they are searching and hoping for has been there for them all along. As the true meaning of that one day back in 1988 is revealed, they come to terms with the nature of love and life itself. -<br /><br />CREDITS:<br />TM &amp; © Universal (2011)<br />Cast: Anne Hathaway, Jim Sturgess, Romola Garai, Patricia Clarkson<br />Director: Lone Scherfig<br />Producers: Raphaël Benoliel, Jane Frazer, Nina Jacobson, Tessa Ross<br />Screenwriter: David Nicholls<br /><br />WHO ARE WE?<br />The MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.
