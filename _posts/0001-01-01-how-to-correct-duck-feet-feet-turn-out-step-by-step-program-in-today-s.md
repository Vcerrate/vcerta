{% raw %}In today's video, we're going to diagnose the root cause of your duck feet and give you the proper program you need based on which muscles are causing the movement impairment.<br /><br />There are several causes of duck feet but in this video we go over the two most common causes I see with new clients. That is excessive hip external rotation and a lack of ankle dorsiflexion. <br /><br />Let's diagnose which one of these may be causing your feet to turn outward and I'll give you the stretches and strengthening exercises to fix it for good.<br /><br />I hope this helps and if you have questions please let me know in the comments. <br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />Online Personal Training: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lightsidewellness.com/personal-training">https://www.lightsidewellness.com/personal-training</a><br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lightsidewellness.com/">https://www.lightsidewellness.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to my email newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mailchi.mp/a1902e540f45/lightsidewellness">https://mailchi.mp/a1902e540f45/lightsidewellness</a><br /><br />â–º Music Credit: LAKEY INSPIRED<br />Track Name: &quot;Smile&quot;<br />Music By: LAKEY INSPIRED @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired">https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired</a><br />Original upload HERE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jd4nR...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jd4nR...</a><br />Official &quot;LAKEY INSPIRED&quot; YouTube Channel HERE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOmy...">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOmy...</a><br />License for commercial use: Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported &quot;Share Alike&quot; (CC BY-SA 3.0) License.<br />Full License HERE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...</a><br />Music promoted by NCM <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ">https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ</a> <br /><br />#duckfeet #posturecorrection #tighthips #anklemobility{% endraw %}
