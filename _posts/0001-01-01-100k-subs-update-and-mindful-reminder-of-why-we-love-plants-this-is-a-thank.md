{% raw %}This is a thank you video for helping me reach a milestone of 100k subscribers. This tells me that you guys appreciate my hard work, and that my work have positive impact on your lives. I share some updates over a strong alcoholic beverage... and at the end of the video, share gentle reminders of why I started my plant journey in the first place. I'm the first to admit, that the rapidly evolving plant business has clouded by passion for plants. I am on my way to recovery, and rediscover my love for plants on a whole new level. A lot of exciting travel and plant styling content to come!{% endraw %}
