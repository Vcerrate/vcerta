{% raw %}#supercross #race #motocross #dirtbike <br />The fastest riders in the sport of Supercross got a chance to ride the Anaheim 3 track on Friday before racing began on Saturday night. Riders like Hunter Lawrence, Jo Shimoda, Ken Roczen, Eli Tomac, Carson Brown, Christian Craig, Nate Thrasher, Cooper Webb, Vince Friese, and more were all able to get a little practice in. We shot some raw clips of the riders on the all new track for this weekend. This is the final stop in Anaheim and we are certain that in both the 250/450 classes there will be an all out fight to see who is the king of Anaheim. Points are close and anything can happen. We hope this allows you to be here with us as we wait and watch to see what shakes up at Round 6 of the Monster Energy Supercross Season. <br /><br /><br />Subscribe to Motocross Action:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hi-torque.com/product/subscribe-to-motocross-action-magazine/">https://hi-torque.com/product/subscribe-to-motocross-action-magazine/</a><br /><br />Follow Motocross Action:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC13uOawMwZh56D2dEn41Gyw/feed?view_as=public">http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC13uOawMwZh56D2dEn41Gyw/feed?view_as=public</a><br /><br />Motocross Action Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.motocrossactionmag.com/">http://www.motocrossactionmag.com/</a><br /><br />Motocross Action Facebook:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Motocross-Action/179374025430397?fref=ts">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Motocross-Action/179374025430397?fref=ts</a><br /><br />Motocross Action Twitter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MXAction">https://twitter.com/MXAction</a><br /><br />Motocross Action Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/motocrossactionmag">http://instagram.com/motocrossactionmag</a>{% endraw %}
