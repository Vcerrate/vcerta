{% raw %}This video is a job we did to tear-down, disassemble &amp; reassemble a hydraulic cylinder for a Caterpillar 740 Articulated Dump Truck. This is the front suspension strut cylinder on the truck, the cylinder is bypassing and the seals on the cylinder gland are destroyed. This shows the step by step process to disassemble and tear-down the cylinder, install a new seal kit and reassemble the cylinder. First we use our 150T Hydraulic Press to help with the disassembly and tear-down of the cylinder. We also need to fabricate flogging spanners to remove the gland and 4&quot; inch nut from the cylinder. We clean and inspect all the components before installing a new seal kit and re-assembling the hydraulic cylinder in our press.<br /><br />DONATE TO QLD STAFFY RESCUE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.qldstaffyandamstaffrescue.org.au/">https://www.qldstaffyandamstaffrescue.org.au/</a><br /><br />Join our channel:<br />We upload new videos every Friday at 5pm AEST!
