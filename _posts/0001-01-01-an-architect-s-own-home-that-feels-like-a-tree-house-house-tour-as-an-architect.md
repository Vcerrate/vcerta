{% raw %}As an architect’s own home, SRG House by Studio Johnston balances its heritage context with contemporary design aesthetics. Facing the nearby water, the family home retains natural qualities through a strong connection to the surrounding bushland. Despite its inner-city location, the structure has an almost tree house-like quality to it, relating to its waterfront position in subtle and interesting ways.<br /><br />The original building was dilapidated and had a number of unsympathetic alterations. Being an architect’s own home and after being stripped back, SRG House was reimagined to capture an element of discovery, seen through the materials used and maintained. <br /><br />The house stands as three storeys with an entrance at its middle level. To the left sits the kitchen, and adjacent to this is the dining area with inbuilt furniture. The house tour then follows the floor plan out to the living space that looks out towards the water. In the original structure, the downstairs space was underutilised and was transformed to become bedrooms and a lounge room overlooking the pool.<br /><br />As an architect’s own home, the project uncovered the materials hidden underneath multiple layers of internal alterations. Stripping the structure back to its concrete frame, Studio Johnston used this as a cue to what contemporary materials would then be brought back into the interior design.<br /><br />An architect’s own home, SRG House uses rich and earthy colours that relate to the original palette of the structure and to also soften the external elements. Brass benchtops, a custom-built BBQ, Artedomus INAX tiles and custom-made light birch plywood joinery feature throughout the residence. As an architect’s own home, the materials had to work with the harsh geometry of the building itself. The structure faces both west and south, a challenge due to the use of extensive glass used. High performance glass was installed to maximise the sunlight whilst also still retaining the desired original rhythm and façade aesthetic.<br /><br />00:00 - Introduction to the Architect's Own Home<br />00:40 - Heritage and History of the Tree House<br />01:27 - House Design of the Architect's Own Home<br />02:10 - Reimagining and Utilising Materials<br />03:40 - The Aspect of the Tree House<br />04:23 - The Architect's Favourite Part of the Home<br />04:58 - Materials, Products and Furniture Round-Up<br /><br />For more from The Local Project: <br /><br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/">https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/</a> <br />Website – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/</a> <br />Print Publication – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/</a> <br />The Local Marketplace -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/marketplace/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/marketplace/</a><br /><br />To subscribe to The Local Project's Tri-Annual Print Publication see here – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/</a> <br /><br />Architecture and Interior Design by Studio Johnston.<br />Photography by Anson Smart.<br />Landscape by Dangar Barin Smith.<br />Build by SQ Projects.<br />Structural Engineering by SDA Structures.<br />Timber by Abodo.<br />Tiles by Artedomus.<br />Filmed and Edited by O&amp;Co. <br />Production by The Local Project.<br /><br />#AnArchitectsOwnHome #Architecture #InteriorDesign #TreeHouse #Home #House #Furniture #Design #Architect #Australia #Sydney #HouseTour #FamilyHome{% endraw %}
