{% raw %}What is camouflage? Why do animals need to use it? Well, in Animal Camouflage, your kids and students will learn the answers to these questions! First off, there are many different kinds of camouflage, and we will discuss four of the main kinds that apply to animals in this video. Did you know that there is actually more than one reason that animals use camouflage?<br /><br />A lot of animals use camouflage to hide from predators. The colors of their skin or fur helps them blend into the environment around them. Some animals, though, use camouflage to hunt. For the same reason that camouflage helps some animals hide to avoid predators, other animals blend into their surroundings to catch their prey unaware! In addition to hiding and hunting, a few animals use their coloring to communicate. Take the chameleon, for example. Most people think chameleons use color changing to fool predators. But that's not actually true! Chameleons change colors to communicate to other chameleons! They change color to communicate danger, to attract a mate, or simply to signal a change of environment.<br /><br />These animals are so cool!
