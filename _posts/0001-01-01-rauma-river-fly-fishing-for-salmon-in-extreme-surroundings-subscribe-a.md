I 2021 was the official opening of an infection free river.<br /><br />Fishing was though due to warm and stable weather, but it was a great experience to be back in this river. Luckily I also fished some of the smaller rivers in the area that provided me with more success.<br /><br />~ Sondre Kvalsvik Stenberg{% endraw %}
