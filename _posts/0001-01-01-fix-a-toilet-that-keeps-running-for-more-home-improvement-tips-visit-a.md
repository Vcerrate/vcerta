Your toilet tank has a fill valve, flush valve, and flapper. And it's these parts that ultimately lead to the toilet running. My $116 water bill could have been prevented by simply replacing the $5 flapper.<br /><br />The second way a leak occurs is when the flapper chain gets stuck between the flapper and flush valve. If you encounter this just trim the chain so that it doesn't drape below the flapper. Problem solved.<br /><br />Sometimes the water in the tank is too high. If this is the case it will run over the overflow pipe and cause the tank to refill. You need to lower the tank's water level to about 1 inch below the overflow pipe. Watch the video for a more in depth explanation.<br /><br />A toilet that keeps running is annoying, not to mention expensive. I'm sharing my tips so that you don't suffer from a $116 water bill like me.
