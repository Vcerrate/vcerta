{% raw %}God before time<br />God outside time<br />God on time<br />God all the time<br />This is yet another love song in adoration to our King, because our hearts are on the altar, forever burning. Our worship poured out like oil on the altar, blazing brightly when we praise You, Our Eternal God. You are always God and we are always yours. Adonai Elohim, may we be overflowing with love for You forever and ever.<br /><br /><br />“The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament shows His handiwork. Day unto day utters speech, And night unto night reveals knowledge. There is no speech nor language Where their voice is not heard.” Psalms 19:1-3 NKJV{% endraw %}
