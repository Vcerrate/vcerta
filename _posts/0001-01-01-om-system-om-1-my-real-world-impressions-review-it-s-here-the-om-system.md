{% raw %}It's here! The OM SYSTEM OM-1. The new flagship camera from OM System! <br />Read the full blog post with more photos here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/CEW-OM1-Review">https://bit.ly/CEW-OM1-Review</a> <br /><br />I've had the honour of being a part of the global launch campaign for the OM-1 and have worked on several projects for OM System and this new camera over the past 4 months. It's been a wild ride and I'm beyond excited to finally share this (and so much more) with you. <br /><br />Similar to my previous Olympus / OM System videos, I'd like to share my real-world experiences with you and let the results of my work do the heavy lifting. <br />In this video I won't be telling you to buy or not to buy, I won't compare to other brands, won't nit-pick or pixel peep, but instead, I hope to inspire through the scenes and stories the camera helped me capture.  <br /><br />I had the honour of using the camera for a microplastics sample collecting project in the extreme weather of arctic Norway. As well as getting to test out its video features while creating a promotional eMTB film for Specialized. <br />When it comes to telling stories, the best camera is the one that is the most natural extension of our expression and I can, with confidence, say that, to me, the OM-1 takes on exactly that role. <br /><br />► Links:<br />Microplastics 'Plastsaq' Project: COMING SOON on the OM SYSTEM GLOBAL YT CHANNEL. <br />Specialized Levo SL Action Film: COMING WED. 16.
