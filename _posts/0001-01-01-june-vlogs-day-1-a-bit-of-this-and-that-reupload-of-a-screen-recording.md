Bill and his friends there all need just a little more care, attention, love and guidance to help them access friendships and education. Bill has autism (and a variety of other issues such as Sensory Processing Disorder, ADD, Dyspraxia, Global Developmental Delay and Klinefelters Syndrome) and most of his school mates have similar challenges as well as Dyslexia across the board. Bill's school is woefully underfunded for a variety of reasons that would take pages of text to explain. The teachers aren't well paid yet they are constantly buying supplies the children need that most pupils don't require; such as pen grips and fiddle toys to aid concentration etc...I have been fundraising for a few years now and with your help have managed to help subsidise school trips, buy sensory room equipment, Occupational Therapy equipment, outdoor tables and chairs, a trampoline...and a mini bus!! # billsspecialbus ðŸ¤© We have a lot to pay for as the school moved premises and took on more pupils. This is all amazing news but means the pressure is on financially. All this fundraising helps a phenomenal school that has given so many children a future they would not have been able to access. Thank you so much for any kind of support you give us.{% endraw %}
