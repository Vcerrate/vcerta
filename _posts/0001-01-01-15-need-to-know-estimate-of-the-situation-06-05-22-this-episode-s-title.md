{% raw %}This episode's title comes from the 1948 document produced by Project Sign, which the head of the Air Force ordered destroyed. Also: with more than two weeks to think about it, Ross and Bryce have more to say about the Congressional hearing on UAP -- including results of a couple of listener surveys. They also come up a few questions that lawmakers SHOULD have asked. And Ross explains why any talk about drones being an explanation for an UAP sighting is idiotic. Hint: drones can't fly that fast, that far, and for that long! <br /><br />This is a video version of the Need to Know podcast which can be found on Apple, Spotify, iHeart, etc. Just search for the whole name, &quot;Need to Know with Coulthart and Zabel.&quot;<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.NeedToKnow.today">https://www.NeedToKnow.today</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.WhatIfUFOs.com">https://www.WhatIfUFOs.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.BryceZabel.com">https://www.BryceZabel.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.RossCoulthart.com">https://www.RossCoulthart.com</a><br /><br />#NeedtoKnow #nuclear #military #congress #hearings #UFO #UAP<br /><br />Bryce Zabel Twitter: @HollywoodUFOs<br />Ross Coulthart Twitter: @RossCoulthart{% endraw %}
