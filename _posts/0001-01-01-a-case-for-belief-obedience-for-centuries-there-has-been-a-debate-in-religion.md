{% raw %}For centuries there has been a debate in religion concerning the role of works in the lives of those seeking to follow Yeshua. Some say justification is by belief alone and if one goes beyond that, he’s “fallen from grace” and now is a law-keeper. Others believe that your belief informs your behavior, and obedience to the commandments is a necessary expectation for salvation. In this video, G. Steven Simons gives a clear understanding of what the Bible Teaches about belief and works and brings all Scripture into agreement on this issue. #ACaseForBeliefObedience #BeliefUntoObedience #ObeyTorah #ObeyBible #Love<br /><br />Message notes: www.triumphintruth.global/messagenotes<br /><br />Thank you for watching Triumph In Truth.
