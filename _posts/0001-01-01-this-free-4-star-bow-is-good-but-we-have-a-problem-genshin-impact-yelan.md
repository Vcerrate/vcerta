{% raw %}Yelan's Fading Twilight bow weapon is actually pretty good... but!<br /><br />About this video:<br /><br />What's the best Yelan weapon or is the new Fading Twilight good for Yelan vs Favonius - I keep seeing these questions pop up in all of my videos recently and for a good reason too. The new Fading Twilight will address some of the things like Yelan dps increase or decrease you get from the weapon but more importantly - I will cover everything you need to know about this new F2P weapon in a sort of a Yelan guide video style.<br /><br />Check out other CC videos on Yelan's weapons here: <br />Sevy Plays reviews the Fading Twilight <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Jq3gWn7Lf9c">https://youtu.be/Jq3gWn7Lf9c</a><br />Xlice extensive weapon review for Yelan <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/vH2fVrQwzGw">https://youtu.be/vH2fVrQwzGw</a><br /><br />Genshin Impact is an open-world gacha game that's available on PC, PS4, PS5 and mobile devices (iOS &amp; Android).
