{% raw %}Going to major cities in Ukraine doesn't always give you the full picture of how life is for the average person and what lies beneath the surface. I decided to go to a mid range city in Western Ukraine called Chernivtsi to get a more inside look and chat with the locals about their opinion on things. I was born in Ukraine myself, but moved to Canada at the age of 5 and would only go for a weeks to visit every couple of years. Even though I think I have more insight than most people about what life is like there, I still have a lot to learn and a lot of the country left to explore.<br /><br />I hope you guys will find this video interesting and please let me know if you would like to see more of this style of content from me.<br /><br />My Immigration Story: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Qu3k6pc7uQs">https://youtu.be/Qu3k6pc7uQs</a><br /><br />Мой русскоязычный канал / My Russian Speaking Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUO4pFMywMoe3TBMcbJq2IA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUO4pFMywMoe3TBMcbJq2IA</a><br /><br />Support my journey on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/alinamcleod">https://www.patreon.com/alinamcleod</a><br />Paypal Account: alina_397@hotmail.com<br /><br />Get $45 FREE STAY CREDIT AND A $17 EXPERIENCE CREDIT when you sign up for AirBnB with my link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.airbnb.ca/c/alinam556">https://www.airbnb.ca/c/alinam556</a><br /><br />Get $25 OFF your first booking from my favorite site to book hostels and hotels: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.booking.com/s/11_6/97664172">https://www.booking.com/s/11_6/97664172</a><br /><br />The Music I Use In My Videos - Epidemic Sound<br />Get a 30 Day FREE TRIAL by using my referral link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/j6z374/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/j6z374/</a><br /><br />Get a FREE AUDIOBOOK when you sign up for Audible's 30 Day Free Trial with my link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.audibletrial.com/alinamcleod">http://www.audibletrial.com/alinamcleod</a><br /><br />**************************************************************<br /><br />- Equipment I Use To Film Videos -<br /><br />Gimbal Camera: DJI Osmo Pocket - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/321Pcpx">https://amzn.to/321Pcpx</a><br /><br />Camera: Sony a5000 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2oJ8YVn">https://amzn.to/2oJ8YVn</a><br /><br />Tripod: Velbon Sherpa 200 R - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2wzQPNZ">https://amzn.to/2wzQPNZ</a><br /><br />Selfie Stick: Arespark Selfie Monopod - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2NbNsq6">https://amzn.to/2NbNsq6</a><br /><br />Lights: Neewer LED Ringlight - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2CfmRnB">https://amzn.to/2CfmRnB</a><br /><br />Drone: DJI Spark Fly More Combo: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Zuhp6G">https://amzn.to/2Zuhp6G</a><br /><br />Osmo Pocket Holster For Phone + External Sound: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2QC2HYq">https://amzn.to/2QC2HYq</a><br /><br /><br />*** FOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA ***<br /><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/alinamcleod/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/alinamcleod/?hl=en</a><br /><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/alinamcleodofficial/?view_public_for=189580024403094">https://www.facebook.com/alinamcleodofficial/?view_public_for=189580024403094</a><br /><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/alina_mcleod?lang=en">https://twitter.com/alina_mcleod?lang=en</a><br /><br />WEBSITE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.alinamcleod.com/">http://www.alinamcleod.com/</a><br /><br />BLOG - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://happyhealthyheroine.com/">https://happyhealthyheroine.com/</a><br /><br /><br />*** I USE AFFILIATE LINKS ***<br />Affiliate links do not cost you as the consumer any more than you would normally pay, but it does offer a kickback to the person who initiated the sale.
