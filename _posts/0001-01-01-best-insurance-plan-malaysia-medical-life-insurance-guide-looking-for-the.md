{% raw %}Looking for the best insurance policies in Malaysia? Which is the best medical card/insurance in Malaysia, are investment-linked plans better or term plans? After comparing plans from the top insurance companies in Malaysia, here's what I've found:<br /><br />3 major insurance types:<br />1. Medical card/insurance (covers your medical/hospital bills)<br />2. Life/TPD (cash payout if you die or are permanently disabled)<br />3. Critical illness coverage (cash payout if you die or are permanently disabled)<br /><br />How much coverage do you need?<br />1. Medical (Important throughout your life - Annual limit RM500k-1.3mil; no lifetime limit; 200 R&amp;B)<br />2. Life/TPD (Important up until financial freedom - Min 10X your annual salary - max [annual expenses/5%]- [net worth]<br />3. Critical illness coverage (Important up until financial freedom - 1-3X your annual salary)<br /><br />What plans should I choose?<br />1. Standalone/term plans (if you are on a tight budget, or for life/TPD/critical illness coverage for a fixed period of time)<br />2. Investment-linked plan (if you plan to maintain coverage for a long time, especially for medical coverage)<br /><br />What did I choose? <br />I chose a basic investment linked plan that focuses on medical coverage only. Still debating whether or not I need life/TPD or critical illness coverage - if I go ahead, it will probably be in the form of a 10-15 year term plan. AIA provided the best coverage at a very competitive cost, Prudential came in as a close second for my personal requirements.<br /><br />I am not an insurance professional, so do consult with an insurance agent before making a decision. Insurance plans are long term commitments, so do shop around and do your research before speaking to insurance agents - not all of them will have your best interest in mind!<br /><br />Timestamp:<br />00:00 Introduction<br />00:45 How insurance works<br />01:26 Types of insurance coverage<br />02:43 Medical insurance - what to look out for<br />04:52 Life/TPD - ideal coverage<br />07:35 Critical illness - ideal coverage<br />09:03 Types of insurance plans<br />09:35 Term insurance (standalone plans)<br />11:30 Investment-linked plans<br />14:01 Best insurance plans{% endraw %}
