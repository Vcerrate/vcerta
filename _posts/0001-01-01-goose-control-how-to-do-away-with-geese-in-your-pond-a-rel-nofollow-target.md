The light emits about as much light as a 100-watt bulb. This is hardly noticeable to people at any time, especially during the day. However, it is extremely unnerving to geese, as the geese are very critical about their nesting areas and choose to not reside by a consistent annoyance. Otherwise, the device is hardly noticeable to people at all; the base and housing are simple, black, and blend in very well in the natural environment.<br /><br /><br /><br />Will it product work year-round?<br /><br />The product will provide continuous service year-round.  The materials that we use in the construction of the product will hold up well against ice and snow, so you can keep the product outside in your pond or in your yard year round. The light automatically recharges itself in sunlight and will keep its charge for up to 6 days without sunlight.<br /><br /><br /><br />What if I have geese at my pond that have recently had goslings? Will the mother and goslings be deterred?<br /><br />Mother geese will not forsake their goslings under any circumstances. However, after thirteen to fourteen weeks the goslings are weaned of their mother and capable of flight. At this point, it will deter both the mother and the developed goslings.<br /><br /><br /><br />Do I need to bring my unit in for the winter season?<br /><br />No. You may keep the product in the pond even when it freezes over. It can be removed, however, in northern regions as geese in these areas migrate to the south. It should be returned to the water in the early spring to continue protecting the water.<br /><br /><br /><br />How many acres will one light cover?<br /><br />Three acres are well covered with one light. When you have a par five at 580 yards with a pond/lake running all along one side you will need two lights. The first one should be placed ¼ of the way and the second at the ¾ mark of the water. This will give some over lapping but total coverage.<br /><br />is the most effective, humane, and environmentally friendly way to eliminate your geese problems.  Protect the course continuously each night with no maintenance.<br /><br /><br /><br />The unit is solar powered and emits an amber colored light, disrupting the sleeping pattern of geese, ultimately encouraging them to move to a new location.  It keeps geese from congregating during molting season, migration and other times of the year.  A single unit protects an area of 4 acres. <br /><br /><br /><br />Used over the course of 1-2 seasons you will notice a dramatic decrease in geese population on the ponds you equip with this product.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Please Note: Your success will be very successful as part of a long-term solution for geese control, results may vary as it is impossible to predict how each individual goose will react to this system.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ForYourShore.com">http://www.ForYourShore.com</a> 877-224-4899{% endraw %}
