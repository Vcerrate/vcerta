Magnesium is in hard water, mineral water, and leafy greens. <br /><br />Magnesium is not just essential for humans, but for plants too. Chlorophyll is like the blood of a plant, and a magnesium deficiency can inhibit a plant‚Äôs ability to make chlorophyll. <br /><br />Chlorophyll is similar in chemistry to our blood. The magnesium in the chlorophyll causes the leaves of a plant to look green, and the iron in our blood makes it look red. <br /><br />There is a condition called chlorosis in plants caused by a magnesium deficiency. Chlorosis in humans is anemia and is caused by an iron deficiency. But, a person with anemia may even look a little green. <br /><br />The unexpected benefits of magnesium:<br />1. It relieves muscle tightness <br />2. It boosts energy <br />3. It supports vitamin D bioavailability <br />4. It helps prevent calcium from depositing in the soft tissues <br />5. It can help relieve migraines <br />6. It supports your friendly bacteria <br />7. It can potentially help reduce paresthesia <br />8. It helps counter cortisol <br />9. It helps balance the parathyroid hormone <br /><br />Causes of a magnesium deficiency:<br /> ‚Ä¢ Not consuming leafy greens <br /> ‚Ä¢ Fluoride consumption <br /> ‚Ä¢ Refined grains <br /> ‚Ä¢ Refined sugar <br /> ‚Ä¢ Low hydrochloric acid<br /> ‚Ä¢ Stress<br /> ‚Ä¢ Diabetes <br /> ‚Ä¢ Alcohol <br /> ‚Ä¢ Malabsorption <br /><br />Medications that can potentially cause a magnesium deficiency:<br /> ‚Ä¢ Diuretics <br /> ‚Ä¢ PPIs and antacids <br /> ‚Ä¢ Statins <br /> ‚Ä¢ Antibiotics <br /> ‚Ä¢ Birth control pills <br /><br />ADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description">https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description</a><br /><br />FREE COURSE‚ûú ‚ûú <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse">http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse</a><br /><br />Talk to a Product Advisor to find the best product for you!<br />Call 1-540-299-1556 with your questions about Dr. Berg's products.
