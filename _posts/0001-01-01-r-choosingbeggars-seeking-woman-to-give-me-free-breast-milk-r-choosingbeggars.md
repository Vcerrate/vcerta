{% raw %}r/Choosingbeggars It's time for another episode of spoiled, out of touch people who don't understand the basic concept of spending money. We've got a guy who is demanding that women give him free breast milk. We've also got a company that is trying to pay people $10 per 4 hours of work, which comes out to $2.50/hour! What an incredible job opportunity!
