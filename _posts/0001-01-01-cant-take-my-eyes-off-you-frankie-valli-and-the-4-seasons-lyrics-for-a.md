{% raw %}For a close friend of mine :)<br /><br />You're just too good to be true.<br />Can't take my eyes off you.<br />You'd be like Heaven to touch.<br />I wanna hold you so much.<br />At long last love has arrived<br />And I thank God I'm alive.<br />You're just too good to be true.<br />Can't take my eyes off you.<br /><br />Pardon the way that I stare.<br />There's nothing else to compare.<br />The sight of you leaves me weak.<br />There are no words left to speak,<br />But if you feel like I feel,<br />Please let me know that it's real.<br />You're just too good to be true.<br />Can't take my eyes off you.<br /><br />I love you, baby,<br />And if it's quite alright,<br />I need you, baby,<br />To warm a lonely night.<br />I love you, baby.<br />Trust in me when I say:<br />Oh, pretty baby,<br />Don't bring me down, I pray.<br />Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay<br />And let me love you, baby.<br />Let me love you.<br /><br />You're just too good to be true.<br />Can't take my eyes off you.<br />You'd be like Heaven to touch.<br />I wanna hold you so much.<br />At long last love has arrived<br />And I thank God I'm alive.<br />You're just too good to be true.<br />Can't take my eyes off you.<br /><br />I love you, baby,<br />And if it's quite alright,<br />I need you, baby,<br />To warm a lonely night.<br />I love you, baby.<br />Trust in me when I say:<br />Oh, pretty baby,<br />Don't bring me down, I pray.<br />Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay{% endraw %}
