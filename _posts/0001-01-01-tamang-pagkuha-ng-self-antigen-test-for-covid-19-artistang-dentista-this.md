{% raw %}This episode will teach you the proper way of taking an Antigen test also known as Lateral Flow test. This is a suitable point of care testing that directly detects the presence of SARS-COV2, the virus that causes COVID 19. It is fast, simple, can be done on people ages 2 years old and above, results can be obtained in 15-20 minutes.
