{% raw %}On the 12th of March, 1928, just before midnight, the St Francis Dam in Los Angeles County, California, failed catastrophically. The dam, built just a few years before, had been holding back around 47 million cubic meters (or 12.4 billion gallons) of water. Now, as the concrete of the dam crumbled, this water swept down the Santa Clarita river valley in a gargantuan wave, destroying everything in its path. The collapse of the dam would turn out to be one of the worst civil engineering disasters in American history.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:50 - Background<br />04:31 - The St Francis Dam Disaster<br />07:46 - The Aftermath<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery.
