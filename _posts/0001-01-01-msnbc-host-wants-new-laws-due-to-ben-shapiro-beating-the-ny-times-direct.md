{% raw %}Dave Rubin of “The Rubin Report” talks about Joe Scarborough demanding that something be done about the success of the Daily Wire, AOC losing it over social media censorship demands, the January 6 committee distraction, and if the Elon Musk Twitter deal is about to fall apart. First, Dave shares a clip from MSNBC's &quot;Morning Joe&quot; where the hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski talk to Dan Pfeiffer about the problem of disinformation and mainstream media no longer being seen as a trusted news source. They admit that more people are getting their news from Ben Shario and Dan Bongino, than the New York Times. The only solution that they can see is using the government regulations to tackle Facebook fake news and online disinformation. Next, AOC took to Instagram for her latest unhinged rant where she demanded social media censorship and more big tech regulation. Barack Obama is continuing to push for stricter regulations to tackle the disinformation age as well, while New York governor Kathy Hochul is blaming social media for recent violence. While many families are struggling with inflation, high gas prices, and a national baby formula shortage, NBC News’ Yamiche Alcindor thinks that it’s far more important for people to put those concerns aside and focus on the primetime January 6th hearings. Finally, Elon Musk threatened to back out of buying Twitter as reports surfaced about the number of fake and bot accounts that plague the site. Will the price of Twitter stock collapse if Musk pulls out?<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Today’s Sponsors:<br />Raycon - Looking for new wireless earbuds starting at half the price of other premium brands?<br />Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.buyraycon.com/rubin">http://www.buyraycon.com/rubin</a><br />Rubin Report viewers will get 15% off all their products.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Watch The Rubin Report on BlazeTV:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.blazetv.com/series/8oHZJGqX8aaN-the-rubin-report">https://www.blazetv.com/series/8oHZJGqX8aaN-the-rubin-report</a><br /><br />----------<br /><br />The Direct Message segments of the Rubin Report are a chance for Dave Rubin to directly address current events, political news and the topics of the day.
