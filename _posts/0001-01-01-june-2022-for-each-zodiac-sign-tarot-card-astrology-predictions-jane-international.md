{% raw %}JUNE 2022 Tarot Card Reading for All Zodiac Signs During Gemini/Cancer Season!<br /><br />Gemini Season (June 2022) and on into Cancer Season - The change of the seasons (Spring into Summer) symbolizes movement into a period of flourishing and materialization. Seeds begin to sprout and we witness the magic of our gardens fruitfulness. <br /><br />Few major transits to be aware of: First and foremost, June 3rd and June 4th - Mercury goes Direct in Taurus and Saturn goes Retrograde in Aquarius. Yes, in a square with one another. We confront our fears. We look at what's holding us back. We look at where we're shrinking. We look at where we struggle to shine - and THAT is exactly where the gold within us lies. There is no doubt that you will have some major breakthroughs and realizations as we start off June... its' just a matter of what you're going to do about it?<br /><br />Jupiter and Mars in Aries are demanding action right now - and while surrendered moments and magical energies are all very well and good - there is nothing like Aries energies to kick us in the butt and get us moving a little bit. Sometimes the Aries impatience can be a good thing when it applies to us getting fed-up with ourselves and our own lackluster approach. Aries wants excitement, passion and enthusiasm and it won't settle for less. <br /><br />Venus and Mercury will both be entering Gemini (June 22nd and June 13th respectively) which activates our creative mind. Right now, we need to &quot;think outside the box&quot; a little bit - and by that I mean: &quot;think outside of what everyone else is thinking&quot;. I know you're looking around and saying to yourself: I want to do something different from all these people. I want to be unique, special, one-of-a-kind. I want to offer something of value in this world that helps the world grow and expand in a beneficial way. Chances are - if you open yourself like this, the energies of the higher realms will channel through you collectively and expose the unexplored corners of the collective consciousness and reveal a need the world has that is not being met at the moment. A need that your talents and skills can fill - and enjoy the lucrative rewards for as well.<br /><br />Lastly, Sun moves into Cancer on June 21st. A week later, June 28th, we have both a New Moon in Cancer and Neptune goes Retrograde in Pisces. Yes, the last week will be especially emotional, without question.  I think it will complement the Aries Jupiter and Mars quite nicely. <br /><br /><br />****************************<br />❤️❤️🙏 Thank you all so much!
