{% raw %}** This film is not to be used for training purposes! **<br /><br />This is an approach towards Larnaca. One of the two big airports of Cyprus. First we passed Paphos on our way for the VOR approach towards Larnaca International airport (in Greek Διεθνής Aερολιμένας Λάρνακας) (LCA, LCLK). <br /><br />This will be a non-precision approach VOR &quot;S&quot; towards runway 04. It is flown using LNAV and VNAV.<br /><br />I incorporated (as a trail) the instruments. The disadvantage is I couldn't provide more info I usually do. So probably I stick with the view from behind &quot;observer seat view&quot; as seen in my last film. (Landing runway 22 Amsterdam Airport Schiphol).<br /><br />Music: Ariel - Ooyy<br /><br />Enjoy the film!<br /><br />All ATC and conversations are from this flight.<br /><br />Greetings,<br /><br />MightyMKL<br /><br />(Don't forget to subscribe &amp; like!)<br /><br />Twitter &amp; Instagram @mightymkl<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MightyMKL">https://twitter.com/MightyMKL</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mightymkl">https://www.instagram.com/mightymkl</a><br /><br />The music used in this episode is from Epidemic Sound.<br />Want to use royalty free music for your films/projects, use next link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/2kbmo7/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/2kbmo7/</a>{% endraw %}
