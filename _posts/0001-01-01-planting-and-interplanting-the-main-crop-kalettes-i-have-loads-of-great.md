For example if I suggest sowing carrots in November, take a look at my monthly tours to see them growing and my harvest videos for May to see the actual results. I'm not just about regurgitaing information from the backs of seed packets!<br /><br />Just because all my resources are 'free of charge', to everyone, doesn't mean they aren't good quality. My objective is to make sure that there's no need to be rich to get access to great gardening information.  I do however have a lot of costs to cover and my time is valuable to me, so please consider supporting me at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/steverichards">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/steverichards</a>{% endraw %}
