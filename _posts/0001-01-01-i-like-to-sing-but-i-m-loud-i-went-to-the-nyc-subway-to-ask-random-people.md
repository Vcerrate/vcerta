{% raw %}I went to the NYC subway to ask random people to sing. That's when I met Becky! Becky is a nanny of 4 kids, and loves to sing. But she doesn't sing a lot. One reason why is because her singing voice is too loud for people around her. Thankfully, when you sing with me, you can sing as loud as you want! <br /><br />Find Becky on Instagram: www.instagram.com/beckybedamned<br /><br />As a musician, I'm all about creating musical experiences that have people feeling happy and free, and that's why the &quot;Sing With Me&quot; series exists. Since 2018, I have asked thousands of random people to sing with me on camera. A lot of people have said no, some have said no initially but changed their minds to yes, and some have said yes right away. I ask these people to sing with one purpose: to create a way for them to experience a sense of happiness and freedom they did not feel before. And much of the time, this actually works (and that makes ME happy).<br /><br /><br />â–º Get the Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/guitaro-5000-store">https://teespring.com/stores/guitaro-5000-store</a><br /><br /><br />Consider a $10 donation in my virtual tip jar.
