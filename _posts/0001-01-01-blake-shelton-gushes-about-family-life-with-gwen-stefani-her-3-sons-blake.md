{% raw %}Blake Shelton doesn't mind if his career starts to slow down because he is loving life at home with Gwen Stefani and her three kids. The 45-year-old country singer spoke to Lon Helton at the 2022 Country Radio Seminar and opened up about why he is excited for the next chapter of his life. &quot;You gotta get some life in there, and marrying Gwen, I've married into a family. She's got three boys...and all of a sudden you go, there's other stuff.&quot; Blake and Gwen tied the knot in Oklahoma last July. After they said &quot;I do&quot; the country star became a stepdad to her three sonsâ€”15-year-old Kingston, 13-year-old Zuma and 8-year-old Apollo, all of whom she shares with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale.{% endraw %}
