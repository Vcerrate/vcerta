{% raw %}I’ve just disembarked a European river cruise on a cruise line that cost around 1/3rd of most other river cruise lines, it was a very eventful cruise in lots of ways and a few very odd things did happen. <br /><br />Normally if you want to take a European river cruise you’re looking at £300, £400 pounds per night. Some cost £1000 per night but I paid less than that for an entire week, including flights, cruising on the Danube with TUI staying in a superior balcony cabin. <br /><br />Check out TUI river cruises here: tui-uk.7cnq.net/ZdvRER (affiliate link)<br /><br />I’ve taken river cruises in the past on the more luxurious lines but when TUI announced that they were starting river cruising I hoped that TUI would be the answer to river cruising on a budget. <br /><br />00:00 - Introduction<br />00:11 - Why Did I Book This Cruise?<br />00:39 - What Did Our Cruise Include?<br />01:06 - My Pre Cruise Concerns<br />01:36 - First Impressions<br />02:02 - What is The TUI Skyla Like?<br />03:05 - Are River Cruises Wheelchair Friendly?<br />03:29 - River Ships Dock Side by Side<br />04:01 - What Are River Cruise Cabins Like?<br />05:07 - What’s it Like to Have a Cabin Below The Waterline?<br />05:46 - One of my Least Favourite Things About The Cabin<br />06:03 - How Many Plug Sockets Are There on TUI River Ships?<br />06:23 - Were Dining Times Fixed?<br />07:20 - When Was Breakfast?<br />07:48 - What Were The Crew Like?<br />08:58 - This Ship Was Electric (Literally)<br />09:32 - What Was Our Itinerary?<br />10:07 - What Drinks Are Included?<br />11:08 - Setting Sail From Budapest<br />11:29 - The Problem With Our Bathroom<br />12:52 - Docking in Bratislava, Slovakia<br />13:16 - Our Air Conditioning Didn’t Work<br />14:13 - How Was Feedback Taken?<br />14:24 - What Did We Do in Bratislava?<br />15:16 - Are River Cruise Schedules Fixed?<br />15:42 - When do River Cruise Ships Dock?<br />16:03 - Whats The Dress Code?<br />16:37 - How We Got an Upgrade<br />17:33 - What Capacity Was The Ship at?<br />18:45 - What Were The Walking Tours Like?<br />19:08 - How do You Listen to The Guide?<br />19:31 - Can You Get WiFi on a River Cruise?<br />20:41 - Do TUI Have an App?<br />21:14 - Are River Cruises Boring?<br />22:20 - My Favourite Excursion<br />23:06 - What is Going Through a Lock Like?<br />23:52 - Which Other Ships Did we See?<br />24:29 - What Was The Food Like?<br />26:20 - How Many Restaurants Were Onboard?<br />26:45 - How Old Were The Other Guests?<br />28:29 - What Did The Other Guests Think?<br /><br /><br />▶ Weekly Updates: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://EmmaCruises.com/News">http://EmmaCruises.com/News</a><br />▶ Book a Cruise: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://EmmaCruises.com/Book-a-Cruise/">https://EmmaCruises.com/Book-a-Cruise/</a><br /><br />Let’s Connect! <br />▶ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://EmmaCruises.com/SocialLinks">https://EmmaCruises.com/SocialLinks</a><br /><br />*** <br />▶  Background World Map: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://emmacruises.com/recommends/wood-world-map/">https://emmacruises.com/recommends/wood-world-map/</a> (Affiliate link)<br /><br />emma@emmacruises.com{% endraw %}
