{% raw %}There are 15 Melee Pit Challenges across 4 Melee Pit Locations in Horizon Forbidden West. All of them are needed for Defeated the Enduring Trophy (Bronze).<br /><br />You can still do these after the story in free-roam. To play the challenges you must first unlock the necessary melee combos from the &quot;Warrior&quot; Skill Tree. This costs skill points, which you get by leveling up, doing side quests/errands, and from clearing points of interest on the map (such as Tallnecks, Cauldrons, Rebel Camps). The Melee Pits require you to do some melee combos and defeat the Pit Master. After completing all 15 Challenges you can challenge The Tenakth Melee Master &quot;The Enduring&quot;, which is the hidden 16th Challenge. After this you get the trophy.<br /><br />Melee Pits Text &amp; Screenshot Guide: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.powerpyx.com/horizon-forbidden-west-melee-pit-challenges-guide/">https://www.powerpyx.com/horizon-forbidden-west-melee-pit-challenges-guide/</a><br /><br />TIMELINE:<br /><br />Melee Pit: Chainscrape<br />Challenge #1: Block Breaker - 0:00<br />Challenge #2: Resonator Blast - 0:46<br />Challenge #3: Pit Master Challenge - 1:10<br /><br />Melee Pit: Scalding Spear<br />Challenge #4: Warriorâ€™s Wrath - 1:29<br />Challenge #5: Aerial Punisher - 2:08<br />Challenge #6: Pit Master Challenge - 2:29<br /><br />Melee Pit: The Bulwark<br />Challenge #7: Jump-Off and Shoot - 2:48<br />Challenge #8: Seek and Strike - 3:29<br />Challenge #9: Sustained Breaker - 3:52<br />Challenge #10: Pit Master Challenge - 4:16<br /><br />Melee Pit: Thornmarsh<br />Challenge #11: Destroyer Chain - 4:55<br />Challenge #12: Reap and Clear - 5:37<br />Challenge #13: Energy Surge Chain - 6:04<br />Challenge #14: Power Rush - 6:27<br />Challenge #15: Pit Master Challenge - 6:58<br /><br />The Enduring - 7:32<br /><br />Horizon Forbidden West Trophy Guide &amp;
