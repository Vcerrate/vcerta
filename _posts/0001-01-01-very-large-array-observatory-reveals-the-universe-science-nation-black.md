{% raw %}Black holes, star births and deaths, colliding galaxies and more -- all in a day's work at the VLA<br /><br />The Very Large Array, or VLA, is a complex of 27 massive antennas on the Plains of San Agustin in central New Mexico, all pointing skyward to monitor radio emissions from the cosmos. With support from NSF, astronomers, such as Claire Chandler, use this facility to observe the most dynamic, cataclysmic events in the universe.<br /><br />The research in this episode was supported by NSF award #1647378, National Radio Astronomy Observatory: Very Large Array Operations and Maintenance.<br /><br />NSF Grant URL:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1647378&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1647378&amp;HistoricalAwards=false</a><br /><br />Miles O'Brien, Science Nation Correspondent <br />Kate Tobin, Science Nation Producer{% endraw %}
