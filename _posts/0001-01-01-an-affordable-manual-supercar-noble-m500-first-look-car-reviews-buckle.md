{% raw %}This week on Buckle Up, the unthinkable has happened. An actual real-life manufacturer invited the lads to go and look at their new car. And it's not just any car - this is the new Noble M500.<br /><br />The successor and baby brother to the infamous Noble M600, the M500 will represent Leicester against the world's other supercars - namely the Ferrari 296 GTB, the Lamborghini Huracan, the Audi R8 and the McLaren Artura, as well as smaller sports cars like the new Lotus Emira.<br />-----------------------------------<br /> BUY OUR MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.spreadshirt.co.uk/buckle-up-merch/all">https://shop.spreadshirt.co.uk/buckle-up-merch/all</a><br />-----------------------------------<br />Support what we do, and get some bonuses too! <br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/buckleup">https://www.patreon.com/buckleup</a> <br />-----------------------------------<br />Follow us on Social Media! <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Buckle.Up.Official.Productions/">https://www.facebook.com/Buckle.Up.Official.Productions/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BuckleUp_Show">https://twitter.com/BuckleUp_Show</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/buckleup_show/">https://www.instagram.com/buckleup_show/</a> <br />Reddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://reddit.com/r/buckleup_show">https://reddit.com/r/buckleup_show</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRy9erBk/">https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRy9erBk/</a><br />---------------------------------<br />#BuckleUp #Noble #M500                              <br />---------------------------------<br />Buckle Up is a channel that is only interested in one thing â€“ cars! <br /><br />We upload a myriad of different content including car review videos, car challenge videos, car news videos and much, much more! <br /><br />Our videos are made in a similar style to that of Top Gear, Fifth Gear, Car Throttle, Doug DeMuro, carwow, Carfection, The Grand Tour, MotorTrend and many more. <br /><br />We would all thoroughly recommend their channels, so why not go and check them out.{% endraw %}
