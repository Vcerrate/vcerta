{% raw %}In May 2018 I travelled via Istanbul Atatürk Airport to and from Asia and had to change flights there.<br />I arrived from an EU airport (Dublin) and we were allowed to proceed without security check.<br />Additionally, afterwards it was followed by a long walk to the main part of the terminal. In which you can find most restaurants as well as Duty-Free shops and the smoking area.<br />All in all, my rating for the airport would be neutral as there are not many spots to look at the tarmac and aircraft movements. Most times you are walking through what feels like hallways and don’t get to see much of daylight.{% endraw %}
