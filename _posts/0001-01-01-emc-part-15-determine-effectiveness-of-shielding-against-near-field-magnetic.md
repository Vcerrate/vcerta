{% raw %}A Series video link : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/cCRgWxNA6PA">https://youtu.be/cCRgWxNA6PA</a><br /><br />All EMC video: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQrHUvvfppk&amp;list=PLFxhgwM1F4ywicEggR3pzF0FcFcGQvZ82">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQrHUvvfppk&amp;list=PLFxhgwM1F4ywicEggR3pzF0FcFcGQvZ82</a><br /><br />Discussion on the Effectiveness of Shielding on Magnetic-Field Coupling with equations on 2 cases. 1) Non-magnetic Shield Grounded At Only One End and 2) Non-magnetic Shield Grounded At Both End.<br /><br />Step by Step derive the equations of induce voltage from conductor 1 (noise source) to Conductor 2 (victim) with shielding.<br /><br />Compare the 2 sets of equations: with shield and without shield at low and high frequencies so as to aware which methods or techniques to apply to resolve the problem. <br /><br />From the equations,  we study how we can maximize the use of shielding against Magnetic-field or Inductive coupling. We also conclude if the shielding is effective or not against Magnetic-field Coupling.{% endraw %}
