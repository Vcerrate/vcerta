Eating almost everything else with your hands is considered rude, but why is sushi allowed?<br /><br />When sushi became a popular dish during the Edo period (1603~1868), they were about 3~5 times bigger than the ones we know today. This is because sushi was originally a kind of fast food served at street vendors and because of their huge size they were too big to eat with chopsticks.<br /><br />So the people of Edo would just grab them with their hands to eat, just like how we would eat Onigiri rice balls or hamburgers with our hands today.<br /><br />The sushi today is actually served by cutting the original Edo-sized toppinginto 2 or 3 pieces to make it easier to eat. This size of sushi was created long after Japan westernized in the early 20th century. This is when it finally became possible to eat them with chopsticks but even now because of its original culture, it is considered appropriate to eat with your hands.<br /><br />*The content is based on personal studies and experience<br />There is no intention of denying other theories and cultural aspects<br /><br />▼Who is Shogo?
