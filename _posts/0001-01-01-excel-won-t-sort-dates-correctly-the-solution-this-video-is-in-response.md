{% raw %}This video is in response to a request from Imran who explained that although he had followed the advice in one of my earlier videos about how to sort dates in Excel, his spreadsheet wasn't working, and that however much he tried, Excel just wouldn't sort his dates by year correctly. In this video I'm using Imran's own spreadsheet to demonstrate what the problem is, and explain clearly step by step how to solve it!{% endraw %}
