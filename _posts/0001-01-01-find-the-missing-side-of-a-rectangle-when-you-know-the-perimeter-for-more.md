There is no 'guess and check' here.<br />1. Starting from the perimeter, we work backwards to find the missing side. We also check our work by adding up all the sides at the end. (Strategy 1)<br />2. (Strategy 2) Reversing the doubling strategy, we solve that missing side length. After the calculation, I go over the steps we took once more.<br />3. (Strategy 3) My favourite: finding the missing side by halving the perimeter first, then solving the missing side by subtraction. It's just the easiest way.<br />Please make sure to take notes to help yourself. ðŸ˜ƒ<br />If you plan to skip part of the video, please just scan through to your preferred strategy and soak it up fast. <br />CC: by me{% endraw %}
