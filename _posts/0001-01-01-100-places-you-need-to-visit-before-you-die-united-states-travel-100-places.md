{% raw %}100 Places You Need to Visit Before You Die. United States Travel<br /><br />Welcome to the world according to Briggs. today we are looking at 100 places you need to see in the United States. I added &quot;before you die&quot; in the title for dramatic effect. Did it work? <br />This is a list we compiled that is based on opinion, experience, tourism, stats, and reputation.  If you think we missed a place in the United States we would love to hear about it. When leaving that suggestion, please remember because we missed one in your opinion your suggestion doesn't need to have insults or profanity, or threats. The internet is getting crazy, don't be crazy about it. <br />I hope you enjoy this video about the United States. It's long, get something to drink.<br /><br />🌍You'll love this one:<br />Natural Wonder of the United States<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/0_YV9Bvqq74">https://youtu.be/0_YV9Bvqq74</a><br /><br />🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹<br /> 🔶My Other Channels: <br />    🟥  On This Day  <br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs9MGJ6xVKLKG_YsQkQNLjg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs9MGJ6xVKLKG_YsQkQNLjg</a><br />    🟥     According To Briggs <br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBkk4NYCe6f7sW4TU6_YO-w">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBkk4NYCe6f7sW4TU6_YO-w</a><br /><br /> <br />  <br /><br />#UnitedStates<br />#100<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />❤Things You should watch or listen to:<br />    Hermens Outdoors:<br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgEIwkmBTuhy6Djx6XipM3g">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgEIwkmBTuhy6Djx6XipM3g</a><br />    Caffeinated Humor Podcast:<br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://anchor.fm/caffeinatedhumor">https://anchor.fm/caffeinatedhumor</a><br />    Kimmie the Explorer:<br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF88qxZPdAfeBVDR2WOjVyg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF88qxZPdAfeBVDR2WOjVyg</a><br /><br />Business &amp; Voice over email: World2Briggs@gmail.com<br /><br />Mailing Address:   World According to Briggs<br />                                 20449 SW Tualatin Valley Hwy<br />                                 # 354<br />                                 Aloha, Oregon 97003{% endraw %}
