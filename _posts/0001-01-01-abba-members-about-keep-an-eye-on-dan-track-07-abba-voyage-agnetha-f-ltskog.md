{% raw %}Agnetha FÃ¤ltskog takes lead vocals on this song about a divorced couple who share custody of their son, Dan. Their child can be difficult to control, so as she hands Dan over, she tells her ex to keep an eye on him.<br /><br />Throughout Voyage, Ulvaeus and Andersson insert references to older ABBA songs. &quot;Keep an Eye on Dan,&quot; for instance, closes with the same piano melody that opens &quot;S.O.S.&quot;{% endraw %}
