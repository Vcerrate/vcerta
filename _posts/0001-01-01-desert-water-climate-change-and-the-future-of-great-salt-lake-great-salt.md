{% raw %}Great Salt Lake is a Utah icon, as famous as great skiing or the Tabernacle Choir. But climate change and a growing population threaten its future. We need to ensure a healthy future for this world-famous ecosystem, used by hunters, bird-watchers, local families, tourists and the minerals and brine shrimp industries, which contribute over $1.3 billion dollars to Utah's economy. This film discusses new ideas for guaranteeing water inflows into the Great Salt Lake.{% endraw %}
