It is about finding the stillness that leads to mental clarity, calmness, and physical healing. It allows us to experience all our faculties as a whole person.<br />In life, most things are beyond our control. The only domain that we have influence over, is ourselves, our reaction and action. The world becomes a better place when we can react to it with more self-awareness. For this to happen, we must first cultivate ourselves, and there is no better way to do this than with meditation. <br /><br /><br />★ Royalty Free Music License - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/38l2C4T">http://bit.ly/38l2C4T</a><br /><br /><br />★ About Us: <br /><br />We love to provide you with self composed therapeutic, healing, meditation &amp; sleep music. <br /><br />We are a channel that promotes sleep, healing, meditation, personal and spiritual growth.<br /><br />We sincerely want our listeners and viewers to get real value out of visiting our channel.<br /><br /><br />Welcome to our channel.<br /><br />Personal Power - Sleep Serenity &amp; Meditation<br /><br /><br />All rights reserved.
