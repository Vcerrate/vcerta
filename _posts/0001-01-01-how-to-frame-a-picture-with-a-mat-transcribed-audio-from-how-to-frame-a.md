{% raw %}Transcribed audio from 'How to Frame a Picture: With a Mat'<br /><br />Framing Online have sent you a custom made frame with a mat. This has been made to your requirements in our workshop and Sarah is going to show you how to insert your certificate.<br />You should have received a frame which you will turn over and put down onto a smooth surface and as well as a frame you should have received a bag which contains a hook some d-rings, some cord for tying it off and particularly for now you will need your two [your several] bits of hinging tape. You may have two if it's a smaller degree or certificate and you will receive more if it's a larger item.<br />Sarah is going to take the back off, she's going to ease up all the flexi-tabs back, if there's any difficulty with this she's going to use a ruler just to push them back and then gently take the back off. She's going to separate the mat from the backing board and place your item face-up on the backing board, leaving the glass in the frame. Take your hinging tape from the bag, peel the hinging tape off the paper and attach to the underside of your certificate or degree, so that it's face-up and the tacky side is facing forward. Take your matboard, put it over your certificate, line it up. Don't feel too concerned if it's not quite right it's easy to just gently peel off and straighten up. Carefully turn over your mat and your item, apply firm pressure to the hinging tape to ensure it bonds well. Insert your hinged item face-down into your frame, just check that your glass is clean and no dust has got in there. Put your backing board on top. Have a quick check on the front before you put down all your flexi-tabs. Check that your glass is clean. Once again if you have any problems with your flexi-tabs just use a ruler, give them a gentle push. It's ready for cord. And there's your certificate. It looks fantastic.<br />If you have any queries don't hesitate to call us or email us at Framing Online.<br /><br />Watch our next video 'Tying Cord' here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/O-TQdM__FNI">http://youtu.be/O-TQdM__FNI</a>{% endraw %}
