To go beyond it, you must know yourself as prior to it.<br /><br />To know yourself as prior to it, you must establish yourself as the knower of the mind, as the watcher of it.<br /><br />And lastly, to establish yourself as the knower of the mind, you must learn to observe it without getting involved in it.<br /><br />If you remain involved in the mind, you will take yourself to BE it. Only when you learn to watch it without reacting to it, you will go beyond it.<br /><br />That is the experience that today’s video is dedicated to guide you into.<br /><br />It is a guided meditation easing you into what it is like to observe the mind without becoming involved in it, to watch it without interest.<br /><br />If this is something that you struggle with, please do yourself a favor and take 10 minutes to yourself today, sit quietly with your eyes closed, and listen to this video with your headphones on.<br /><br />Doing so will be greatly beneficial to you. And I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed making it for you.<br /><br />Have a great rest of your day!<br /><br />Best wishes,<br /><br />Sunny Sharma<br /><br />———————————————————————————<br />Also here are my most recommended playlists from this channel that you should watch:<br /><br />🚩 ADVAITA VEDANTA: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYcmWw9kgC8wdL9U3YKU1bkikMilZf5D">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYcmWw9kgC8wdL9U3YKU1bkikMilZf5D</a><br /><br />🚩 SELF INQUIRY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYcmWw9kgC_9S3mUSSL-GwRQRmr2_PSC">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYcmWw9kgC_9S3mUSSL-GwRQRmr2_PSC</a><br /><br />🚩 LIVING IN ACCEPTANCE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYcmWw9kgC_s9ZxWhcfIdwX2dA_7d41t">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYcmWw9kgC_s9ZxWhcfIdwX2dA_7d41t</a><br /><br />🚩 MEDITATION (Beginner - Moderate): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYcmWw9kgC9G78XFNbQ2viCbBFazg13V">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYcmWw9kgC9G78XFNbQ2viCbBFazg13V</a><br /><br />🚩NON DUALITY:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYcmWw9kgC_s6s5m1M4W1gGP3ketVF-I">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYcmWw9kgC_s6s5m1M4W1gGP3ketVF-I</a><br /><br />🚩 LIVE COACHING FROM SUNNY'S PROGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXC3uNgsay8&amp;list=PLmYcmWw9kgC-xyaArDLky6cKZanxtQtwz">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXC3uNgsay8&amp;list=PLmYcmWw9kgC-xyaArDLky6cKZanxtQtwz</a><br /><br />Sunny Sharma<br />personalmasteryquest.com<br /><br />how to observe your mind, how to observe your thoughts, how to observe your thoughts and emotions, how to observe your thoughts krishnamurti, how to observe your thoughts without judgement, how to just observe your thoughts, observe your thoughts, observing your thoughts{% endraw %}
