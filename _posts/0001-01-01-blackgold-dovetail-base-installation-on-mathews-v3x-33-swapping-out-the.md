{% raw %}Swapping out the Spot Hogg Hogg Father Triple Stack on Mathews V3X 33 for the BlackGold Pro single pin sight using the new dovetail base (bar). In addition to the sight installation, this video also includes adjusting the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd axis and sighting in at 20 yards to make sure there aren't any issues with the windage on the new dovetail bar. Hopefully this helps some of you decide if this sight is right for you.<br /><br />Below are timecodes just in case you want to skip scenes in the video.<br /><br />0:00    Intro<br />1:44    Removal of Wing Truss dovetail from the BG Pro sight housing<br />4:00    Installation of the new dovetail base to the BG Pro sight housing<br />6:33    Fitting the new dovetail base on the bridge-lock riser<br />7:19    Leveling the 1st and 2nd axis<br />13:03  Leveling the 3rd axis<br />13:42  Checking windage or horizontal adjustment<br />17:36  Sighting in my 20-yard zero<br />23:09  Shooting and testing from 50 yards<br /> <br />#BlackGold #MathewsV3X #BlackGoldSight{% endraw %}
