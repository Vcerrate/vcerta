{% raw %}(BE SURE TO SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE HUNTING VIDEOS ON THE WAY)<br /><br />In this video we test out the brand new 2020 cartridge released from Hornady the 6mm ARC on 60 coyotes. This was an exceptional hunt we got to spend with our little girl along with us on stand making memories that will last a lifetime. We also helped out lots of ranchers experiencing livestock predation along the way. <br /><br />Gear Used:<br /> <br />Alex Pro Firearms 6mm ARC 18 Inch 1:7.5 twist Upper<br /><br />@Hornady Manufacturing  108 Grain ELD-M Ammunition<br /><br />@ICO tec  Outlaw predator call loaded with Tony Tebbe Signature Sounds<br /><br />@Digital Trigger  1 lb Trigger<br /><br />@ATN Corp.
