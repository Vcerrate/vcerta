{% raw %}Lauderdale Inflatables in Fort Lauderdale, Florida gave me this small  Pvc Cadet Zodiac Sib.I knew it would be a great time to also buy a hypalon sib and compare the differences.<br /><br />The Dinghy series is meant to show what can be done with a small inflatable boat.<br /><br />Lauderdale inflatables sells both of these boats and usually has them in stock. They can be reached at 954 900-3885<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3djfYj1">https://amzn.to/3djfYj1</a><br /><br />Above is the Link on Amazon for the Blower I use{% endraw %}
