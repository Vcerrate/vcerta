After expenses are taken into consideration, remaining revenue is invested back into BEAUTY IN SOUND. Audio and visual equipment is expensive, and I also pay a fair fee to all recitalists who appear on BIS. This is why I regularly ask YOU to help, and Iâ€™m sorry for having to do so. I hope that you can all see the tangible improvements being made to BIS along our shared journey.<br /><br />Ways to help and support BEAUTY IN SOUND:<br /><br />Join the channel for fun and funky emojis in the Live Chat:<br />â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkdRXZZXDmLJM6XBnUpIoog/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkdRXZZXDmLJM6XBnUpIoog/join</a><br /><br />Becoming a Patron allows you access to an exclusive club with additional content and many perks!
