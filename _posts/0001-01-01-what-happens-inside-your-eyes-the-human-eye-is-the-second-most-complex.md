{% raw %}The human eye is the second most complex organ after the brain. How exactly does the human eye work? How do our eyes see? The human eye is an amazing organ! Did you know, for example, that your pupil is not a black circle in your eyeball – it’s a hole! Black, because there’s no light inside your eye. Red in flash photos because the light from the camera is passing through and bouncing off the back of your eye. <br /><br />Or have you ever heard that your cornea has no blood vessels? They get oxygen directly from the air, so your eyes breathe! But it’s full of super-sensitive nerves. They sense something foreign, and the fastest muscles in your body get to work. Your eyes themselves are about the size of ping pong balls. And just within this seemingly small little organ, there are over 2 million working parts!<br /><br />#brightside<br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
