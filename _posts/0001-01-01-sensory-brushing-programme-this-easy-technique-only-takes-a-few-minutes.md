{% raw %}This easy technique only takes a few minutes and can be really effective for children with tactile hyper sensitivity and for those who seek extra input. <br /><br />A few things to remember:<br /><br />- Don’t brush the face, chest or stomach and avoid direct brushing on the spine. <br />- Try not to go over the same area more than a couple of times, as this may cause the child to become over stimulated.<br />- The technique should be carried out every 2 hours for at least 2 weeks, after which you can reduce the frequency if it is proving effective and just incorporate regular brushing, deep pressure and resistive activities (pushing, pulling, lifting etc) into your child’s usual routine.<br /><br />You can buy your brush here:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sterile-Sensory-Sponge-Bristle-Brush/dp/B072KN59GW/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534343908&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=sensory+brush">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sterile-Sensory-Sponge-Bristle-Brush/dp/B072KN59GW/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534343908&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=sensory+brush</a><br /><br />or here<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wilbarger-Method-Therapressure-Therapy-Brush/dp/B0041MWDMG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534343908&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sensory+brush">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wilbarger-Method-Therapressure-Therapy-Brush/dp/B0041MWDMG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534343908&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sensory+brush</a>{% endraw %}
