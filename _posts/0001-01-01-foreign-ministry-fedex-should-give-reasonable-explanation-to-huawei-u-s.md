{% raw %}U.S. delivery company FedEx has rerouted Huawei packages to the U.S. without authorization. Two packages sent from Japan and two others from Vietnam were apparently diverted and shipped to the U.S. instead of Huawei addresses in China. FedEx said it was a mistake, but a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the U.S. company needs to give a proper explanation for its actions.{% endraw %}
