{% raw %}Osaka Castle is one of Japanâ€™s most famous landmarks. It sits on a one kilometre square plot in Osaka and was built in 1583 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. In stands on top of an older fortified Buddhist Temple that was built in 1496 and according to archaeological excavations, the temple was built upon the ruins of an old imperial palace. This imperial palace was apparently built in the late 4th century AD.<br /><br />So we have a site with at least three phases of building work, and many more if you add in the reconstructions that have took place, a site that has always been an important political centre, with each structure built on the site being of high importance and high status.<br /><br />The focus of this video though is the enormous megalithic blocks that are found inside the grounds of the castle. <br /><br />The most famous megalith is know as the Octopus Stone and is the largest of several megaliths at the castle. <br /><br />At the castle there are, in total, 5 stones that weigh more than 100 tonnes and 15 than weigh more than 50 tonnes.<br /><br />The stonework is truly incredible.
