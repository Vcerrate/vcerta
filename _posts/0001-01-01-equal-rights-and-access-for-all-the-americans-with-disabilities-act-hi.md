{% raw %}Hi friends, happy Thursday!<br /><br />Welcome to the Dark History Podcast. Some things are hard to talk about, but that doesnâ€™t mean we shouldn't talk about it. Which is why we are going to talk about the horrible, dark, treatment that people with disabilities have received for years.  And we will also discuss their fight that led to the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Plus the fight we still have to fight today. <br /><br />I appreciate you for coming by, and tune in next week for more dark history. <br /><br />You can find Dark History podcast on Apple, Spotify, wherever you listen to your podcasts, and every Thursday here on my Youtube for the visual side of things. <br /><br />Apple Podcast- apple.co/darkhistory<br />Dark History Merch- baileysarian.com<br />_______<br /><br />FOLLOW ME AROUND  <br />Tik Tok : BaileySarian<br />Instagram : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2nbO4PR">http://bit.ly/2nbO4PR</a><br />Facebook : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2mdZtK6">http://bit.ly/2mdZtK6</a><br />Twitter : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2yT4BLV">http://bit.ly/2yT4BLV</a><br />Pinterest : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2mVpXnY">http://bit.ly/2mVpXnY</a><br />Youtube : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1HGw3Og">http://bit.ly/1HGw3Og</a><br />Snapchat : BaileySarian <br /><br />RECOMMEND A STORY HERE : cases4bailey@gmail.com <br /><br />Business Related Emails: baileysarianteam@wmeagency.com<br /><br />Chapters:<br />00:00 INTRO<br />03:23 ALMSHOUSES AND SANITARIUMS<br />06:30 EUGENICS (is still not a plant)<br />10:39 ALBERT SIDNEY PRIDDY<br />13:49 THE TRIAL<br />16:44 WILLOWBROOK STATE SCHOOL<br />21:33 THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT &amp; THE REHABILITATION ACT<br />23:10 THE 504 SIT-IN<br />26:35 THE REHABILITATION ACT CONTINUED<br />31:18 THE CAPITOL CRAWL<br />35:35 THE ADA LOOPHOLE<br />39:31 CONCLUSION <br /><br />Bibliography<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DYpvLJYgt4l4j8K9zpYZPBnNAJBSQcBGTlE5n0Gzgoc/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DYpvLJYgt4l4j8K9zpYZPBnNAJBSQcBGTlE5n0Gzgoc/edit?usp=sharing</a><br /> <br />Link to report ADA violations: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://civilrights.justice.gov/report/">https://civilrights.justice.gov/report/</a><br /><br />Dark History is an Audioboom Original.<br /> <br />This podcast is Executive Produced by:<br />Bailey Sarian, Kim Jacobs, Dunia McNeily from 3arts, Justin Comins, and Claire Turner From Wheelhouse DNA<br />Producer: Lexxi Kiven<br />Research provided by: Thomas Messersmith<br />Writers: Jed Bookout, Michael Oberst, Joey Scavuzzo, Kim Yaged<br />I'm your host --  Bailey Sarian<br />Special thank you to ADA Consultant: Marcela Rhoads<br />Video Director: Trent Barboza and Eric Abell<br />Shot By: Tafadzwa Nemarundwe<br />Edited by: Jim Luci<br />Production Management: Meredith Ewinger{% endraw %}
