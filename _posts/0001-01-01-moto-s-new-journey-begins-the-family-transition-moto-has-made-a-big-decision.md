{% raw %}Moto has made a big decision in his life and our family is at a turning point. I'm proud of him because I've been standing next to him and have seen his passion for his work. I am sure he will succeed in his new challenge.<br />It will be a precious memory for our family because I was able to make a video of his last work appearance. Thank you, Ginza Casita and The Celestine Ginza Hotel, for allowing me to film this.<br />Ginza Casita - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.casita.jp/ginza/">http://www.casita.jp/ginza/</a><br />The Celestine Ginza Hotel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.celestinehotels.jp/ginza/eng/">https://www.celestinehotels.jp/ginza/eng/</a><br /><br />We'll keep you updated on what we're up to on Instagram, so be sure to follow us on Instagram!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kimono_mom/">https://www.instagram.com/kimono_mom/</a><br />☆Follow us☆<br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kimono_mom/">https://www.instagram.com/kimono_mom/</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MOE.KimonoMom">https://www.facebook.com/MOE.KimonoMom</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Kimono_Mom">https://twitter.com/Kimono_Mom</a>{% endraw %}
