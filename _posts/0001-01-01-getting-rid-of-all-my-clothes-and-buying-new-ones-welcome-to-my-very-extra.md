{% raw %}welcome to my very extra closet clean out,  part 1000. lol<br /><br />HI ANGELS! Today it's time for some more spring cleaning, so I am giving you a mini closet tour and cleaning out my wardrobe...again. Because when you shop as much as I do, the Marie Kondo style organizing never ends lol.<br /><br />So here is me getting rid of all my clothes. And of course, going on a shopping spree and buying new ones. Enjoy the haul! <br /><br />3,550,000 kisses!<br />Xx<br />Amber :)<br /><br />SHOP MY POSHMARK CLOSET! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://posh.mk/VYFtxy4uSob">https://posh.mk/VYFtxy4uSob</a><br />CHAT WITH ME ON CAMEO! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://Cameo.com/amberscholl">http://Cameo.com/amberscholl</a><br />FOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/amberscholl">https://www.instagram.com/amberscholl</a><br />FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/amberscholl">https://www.twitter.com/amberscholl</a>{% endraw %}
