{% raw %}Fear of May 9: &quot;It may cause disaster&quot;!<br /><br />While Russia shifts its forces to the east in the Ukraine war, it continues its missile attacks on areas where civilians are located. On the other hand, all eyes were turned to the messages that Russian President Vladimir Putin will give on 9 May.<br /><br />What will be Putin's messages on Victory Day, May 9, the Soviet Union's victory over the Nazis in 1945? While Russia's attacks on Ukraine continued, eyes were turned to this date. Exactly one month from now, a military parade will be held in Moscow's Red Square, and Putin will give messages. This parade, intimidating NATO by displaying new types of weapons, will be held in the shadow of the war in Ukraine this year, and statements will gain even more importance in this sense.<br /><br /><br />French President Emmanuel Macron also drew attention to the date of 9 May. In his speech yesterday, Macron, referring to the holiday when Russia defeated Nazi Germany in the Second World War, said, “May 9 is a national holiday for Russia, an important military event, and it is almost imperative that 9 May be a day of victory for Putin. definite. They will concentrate their efforts in Donbas and we will experience very difficult scenes in the coming days.”<br /><br /><br />The French news agency AFP reported that Putin would like to draw parallels between the Soviet victory over the Nazis and the de-Nazism of Ukraine. Speaking to the French news agency, a senior Western official said, &quot;We believe the date of May 9 is important for the Kremlin,&quot; adding that fabricating the military operation for political purposes could lead to disaster on the front.<br /><br />It is stated that another goal of Putin is to continue negotiations by increasing military superiority. In this respect, it is claimed that although he could not capture the entire Donbas until May 9, he aimed to at least gain control over the entire besieged port city of Mariupol.{% endraw %}
