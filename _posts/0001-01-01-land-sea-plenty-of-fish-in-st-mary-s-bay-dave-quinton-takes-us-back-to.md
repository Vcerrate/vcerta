{% raw %}Dave Quinton takes us back to 1986, a year where fish was scarce all over the province, except in St. Mary's Bay. This episode takes us to Gaskers, Peter's River and Riverhead. There's also footage of the salt fish and fresh plants owned by Universal Fisheries of Portugal where the quick freeze machine eliminated the practice of dumping small cod.
