{% raw %}Is the House of Commons too boorish and sexist? <br /><br />A debate's broken out over sexism in Westminster. It started after The Spectator's Isabel Hardman tweeted that she had been called &quot;totty&quot; by an MP. That, she said, women shouldn't have to put up with. <br /><br />She went on to reveal the MP's name had been given to a whip - and that an apology was on the way. But that wasn't the end of it.<br /><br />The Daily Mail's political editor at large, Isabel Oakshott weighed in - declaring Isobel Hardman shouldn't have complained to whips over &quot;what seems to have been a trivial incident&quot;.<br /><br />Matt Frei spoke to Isabel Oakeshott and Ian Dunt, Editor of Politics.co.uk.{% endraw %}
