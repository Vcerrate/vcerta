This show has been going off and it's only getting better. They got a HUGE WIN in the last episode so what are we doing in this one?<br /><br />Moravian has a game and the crowd is a bunch of HATERS! Right off the jump, they're screaming overrated at freshman Eli Ellis. He hears it and goes absolutely NUTS! Bro hit 6 three pointers in the first half and Coach Ellis is telling them to RUN UP THE SCORE! I freaking love it.<br /><br />After that, the guys have a big practice and hop on the road for another game. But first, they had to visit a SNEAKER PLUG! I swear this kid is like 12 years old but he's got every kick in the world.<br /><br />He's down to give them some free Yeezys... but they gotta beat him in ping pong first. Coach Ellis doesn't back down from a challenge LET'S GET IT!<br /><br />Alright dope episode, we're back again next Sunday.
