{% raw %}In what looked like a complete disaster leading up to kickoff, Invicta was able to call on its great network of CABRA ex-pats to rope together a strong team capable of living up to the Invicta name. The game started in emphatic fashion, awarded a 1-0 lead due to opposition tardiness Invicta led 4-1 at the half and never looked back. Noteworthy top up player J.Disotto had a great game in the middle of the park and youngsters O.Hodgson and O.Williams had tremendous games at either ends of the court. C.Beilby put in a shift for a non-soccer player, showing real promise with his tackling and work rate. <br /><br />It is easy to sit back on our laurels after such a win, however AC Invicta is determined to regain some of the top early season form to charge into finals and hopefully secure a maiden league title on the way. <br /><br />Sit back and enjoy the football. <br /><br />Starters - M.Caruso (C) (GK) // O.Williams  / C.Moore / O.Hodgson / J.Brown<br /><br />Instagram - @acinvicta <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/acinvicta/">https://www.instagram.com/acinvicta/</a>{% endraw %}
