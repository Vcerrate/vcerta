{% raw %}Heat Press Machines | Teflon Pillows for Apparel<br /><br />Click here for more info: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://colmanandcompany.com/Teflon-Pillow-10X10.html">https://colmanandcompany.com/Teflon-Pillow-10X10.html</a><br /><br />What is a Teflon Pillow and what would you use it for? Teflon pillows are a spongey heat resistant memory foam with an outer covering of Teflon on both sides. Teflon is used to help fabrics and materials easily glide along its surface and is a non-stick surface for you to use with your DTG printing, heat transfer vinyl (HTV) and other apparel decorating materials. <br /> <br />While the outside layer of Teflon will protect your heat press investment and provide easy movement of the pillow within the garment the 3mil of memory foam is the real magic here. This cushion is meant to help prevent heat press scorching marks on areas that are not completely flat on a garment. On areas such as thick seams, collars, buttons, zippers and in areas around rhinestones there may be different thicknesses that would cause the heat press platen to press more heavily in certain aresas and perhaps not enough in others. <br /> <br />This is where the Teflon pillow can help! <br /> <br />Simply glide the Teflon pillow into or under your garment where you are going to be heat pressing. When you close the heat press the platen will press down onto the highest points of the garment first and then they will press down into the Teflon pillow providing a more even press and even heat distribution all around. That indentation that comes with using a heat press can be eliminated by using the Colman and Company Teflon pillow! <br /><br />Keep your heat press producing more apparel faster! <br /><br />Click here for more info: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://colmanandcompany.com/Teflon-Pillow-10X10.html">https://colmanandcompany.com/Teflon-Pillow-10X10.html</a><br /><br />More videos about Heat Presses, Heat Press accessories and heat transfer vinyl (HTV) <br /><br />Heat Press Pads 1 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Tx1DfcAik_w">https://youtu.be/Tx1DfcAik_w</a><br /><br />Heat Press Pads Pads 2 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/YdsC1zdrcNo">https://youtu.be/YdsC1zdrcNo</a><br /><br />Colman and Company Heat Press <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/_ltJOW_O0Ao">https://youtu.be/_ltJOW_O0Ao</a><br /><br />Triton Rapid Peel HTV Demonstration: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/nCDQrFo2NHk">https://youtu.be/nCDQrFo2NHk</a><br /><br />Triton HTV Applications: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/lOTWmjE-ofc">https://youtu.be/lOTWmjE-ofc</a><br /><br />CutnPress Custom T-Shirt Demonstration <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9MiMkVlUKJY">https://youtu.be/9MiMkVlUKJY</a><br /><br />Hotronix Heat Press Demonstration <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/z8pJ6PqfM4U">https://youtu.be/z8pJ6PqfM4U</a>{% endraw %}
