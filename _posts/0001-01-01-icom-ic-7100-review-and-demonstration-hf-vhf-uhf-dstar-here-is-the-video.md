{% raw %}Here is the video of the Icom IC-7100, my latest Icom rig added to the shack. This is a great radio for anyone wanting to get into HF, VHF/UHF and DSTAR all in one rig. A shack in the box, with a lot of connectivity for even more operating fun. More videos are on the way of this radio, you have to SUBSCRIBE and turn on notifications to stay up to date.{% endraw %}
