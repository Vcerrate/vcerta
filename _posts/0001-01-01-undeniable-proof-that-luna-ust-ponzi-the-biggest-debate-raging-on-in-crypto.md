{% raw %}The BIGGEST Debate Raging On in Crypto Twitter is whether or not Luna and UST are a massive ponzi that may crash one day and take down a huge part of the crypto world with it. Well this is a really nuanced debate with a lot of details that are frankly not spelled out and explained properly on various articles and tweet threads. So I spent hours researching this ponzi debate and I want to share with you my best breakdown of this topic and which way I lean as well. Let me know if anything is unclear or if I got anything wrong. But if you didn’t learn anything new about this Luna UST ponzi debate then let me know in the comments and I’ll personally apologize!<br /><br />Get free $20 credit to bloXroute’s front-running protection service: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gr3f.co/c/51449/aV8Lk">https://gr3f.co/c/51449/aV8Lk</a><br /><br />Shout out to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cryptoeq.io">https://cryptoeq.io</a> for helping me with the research!<br />Credit to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.shivsak.com">http://www.shivsak.com</a> for one of the LUNA UST graphics<br />And also to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://coinsutra.com/anchor-protocol-analysis/">https://coinsutra.com/anchor-protocol-analysis/</a> for their Anchor research<br /><br />Timestamps:<br />0:00 Million Dollar Bets<br />0:56 Luna UST overview<br />3:17 2 scenarios for UST<br />4:53 Fragile Algo Stablecoins <br />6:35 Death Spiral Scenario<br />8:13 Important Nuances<br />10:50 bloXroute Front-Running Protection!<br />12:09 Anchor Protocol Risks<br />15:29 Lost Peg TWICE Before<br />16:55 The Defense of Luna UST<br />18:46 My Final Verdict<br /><br />#Luna #UST #Terra #Ponzi{% endraw %}
