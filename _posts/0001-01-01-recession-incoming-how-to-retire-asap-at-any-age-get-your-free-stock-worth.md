Itâ€™s important to first know where youâ€™re going in order to steer the ship in the right direction. <br /><br />LEVEL ONE: DRIFTING<br />Before this level, youâ€™re financially reliant on other people. Maybe this is student loans, or even your parents. The beauty of beating this level is that you finally gain your independence from those that seek to control you. The issue with drifting is that you canâ€™t work all your life. This leaves you very reliant on potential inheritance to secure your retirement, and not everyone has this luxury. <br /><br />LEVEL 2: STABILITY<br />By reaching this level, you have already beaten the majority of people. As you have secured your retirement in later life. Well I say that, however at this point youâ€™ll be tested more than ever as the drifters will want to drag you back down.<br /><br />LEVEL 3: FREEDOM<br />This is the stage where you unchain yourself from day to day work, and get paid based on your value, rather than your time! At this level you will have invested 25 times your desired annual salary, meaning you should have an endless pot of money if you only withdraw 4% per year. This is known as your freedom figure, and itâ€™s different for everyone. <br /><br />LEVEL 4: ABUNDANCE<br />This is F U money. The kind of money that most people only dream of. That allows you to turn down any opportunity that youâ€™re not interested in, because it just doesnâ€™t matter! In order to achieve this, I combined all of the levels into one. The main difference between financial freedom and financial abundance is having willingness to embrace the new. I mean I was one of the first people over 50 to be on TikTok.<br /><br />____________________________________________<br />CONTACT:<br />For business inquires only, please use this email: mark@marktilbury.com<br /><br />*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies in which Mark Tilbury will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
