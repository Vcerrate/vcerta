{% raw %}With more sanctions made effective, prices go high really quick. Even for domestic products, which at first sight are not dependant on the US dollar, but if you think about the delivery costs, foreign spare details for machinery, market expectations etc., you would understand that there is no product, no field that is not hit with every new rule, every new day.<br /><br />With an average monthly salary of 20000-25000 rubles in the regions, or pensions being at 10000-15000 rubles level, it becomes very hard for regular Russians not just to cover their usual expenses, but just to survive.<br /><br />If you feel it, you can support me through:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/zangieff">https://www.patreon.com/zangieff</a><br /><br />Check out Konstantin's channel (Inside Russia) for even more videos about current situation.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LETTERSTOKING">https://www.youtube.com/c/LETTERSTOKING</a><br /><br />Thanks<br />Stay safe<br />Zangieff{% endraw %}
