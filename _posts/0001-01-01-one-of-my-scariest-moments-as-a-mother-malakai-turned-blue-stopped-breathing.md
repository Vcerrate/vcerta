{% raw %}I decided to post this video to help other mums and spread awareness as how quickly and easily these kind of things can happen. I NEVER imagined I would be performing CPR breathes on my baby but I'm SO glad I was able to act fast and have a positive outcome.<br /><br />I will link the first aid course Kurt, myself and my mum completed (before the birth of Fox) as it really helped give me that little bit of confidence I needed to act. We used @Tiny Hearts Education <br /><br />I also want to say a HUGE thank you to the incredible nurses, doctors, paediatricians and specialists that helped us throughout this whole journey. Particularly now when our health system is so understaffed and over worked. You all hold such a special place in our hearts and were truly our angels during these days of uncertainty and worry.<br /><br />Thank you lord for keeping our boy safe and surrounding us with such incredible and knowledgable staff{% endraw %}
