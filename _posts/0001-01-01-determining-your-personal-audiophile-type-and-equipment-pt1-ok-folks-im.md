{% raw %}OK Folks, Im going to try and simplify things for you and chart this out so you may find your way through the Audiophile Mischt Nudel und Spaetzle (mixed up buttered noodles). <br />The more you understand how you fit in all of this , the easier it will be to draw your lines and make a goal for your music enjoyment.{% endraw %}
