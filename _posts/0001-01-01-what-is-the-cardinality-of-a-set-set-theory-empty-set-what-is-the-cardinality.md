{% raw %}What is the cardinality of a set? In this video we go over just that, defining cardinality with examples both easy and hard. To find the cardinality of a set, you need only to count the elements in the set. The cardinality of the empty set is 0, the cardinality of the set A = {0, 1, 2} is 3. The cardinality of a set A is written |A|.  <br /><br />I hope you find this video helpful, and be sure to ask any questions down in the comments!<br /><br />◆ Donate on PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/wrathofmath">https://www.paypal.me/wrathofmath</a><br />◆ Support Wrath of Math on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/join/wrathofmathlessons">https://www.patreon.com/join/wrathofmathlessons</a>{% endraw %}
