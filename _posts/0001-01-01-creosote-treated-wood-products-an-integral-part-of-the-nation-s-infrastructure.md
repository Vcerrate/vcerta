{% raw %}Creosote-treated wood products have been a valuable part of critical infrastructure throughout North America. This video explains creosote's contribution to the longevity of wood products, its many uses, its treatments processes, and more. <br /><br />Creosote and Railroad Crossties:<br />Creosote-treated wood crossties are an integral part of the railroad transportation network in North America. It is estimated that 20 million railroad crossties will be produced in 2020. Approximately 95% of railroad crossties are treated with creosote.<br /><br />Creosote and Utility Poles: <br />Creosote-treated utility poles are an integral part of the telecommunications infrastructure in the United States. It should be noted that utility poles are subject to the harshest conditions in nature, including rain, snow, ice, wind, decay, and insects. Approximately 130 million utility poles are currently in service across the United States. In service today, these wood utility poles have been preservative treated; it is estimated over 40% of them have been creosote-treated.<br /><br />Creosote and Aquatic and Wetland Areas: <br />The lifespan of creosote-treated bridges, piers, docks, boardwalks, decks, and buildings in aquatic and wetland areas ranges from 40 to 75 years. The useful life of creosote-treated utility poles exceeds 75 years.<br /><br />The Creosote Council is a non-profit product stewardship and joint data development group composed of the U.S. registrants of coal tar creosote. <br /><br />Creosote Council Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creosotecouncil.org/">https://creosotecouncil.org/</a>{% endraw %}
