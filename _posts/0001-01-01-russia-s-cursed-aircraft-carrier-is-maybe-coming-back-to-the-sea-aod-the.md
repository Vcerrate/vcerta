{% raw %}The hapless Admiral Kuznetsov has suffered engine failures, fires, fatal accidents, and even embezzlement.<br />Russian state media claims the country’s only aircraft carrier, Admiral Kuznetsov, will be ready for sea trials in 2022.<br />Russia lacks the money and shipyards to build a replacement for Kuznetsov.<br />Kuznetsov has suffered engine failures, fatal accidents, crashes, fires, and even embezzlement of funds to update the ship.<br />The Soviet Union built the Cold War-era Kuznetsov in what is now Ukraine. The Russian Navy inherited the ship after the breakup of the Soviet Union but lacked the money to operate it at full capacity. While Kuznetsov began construction in 1981, it only conducted its first deployment at sea in 1996.<br /><br />The carrier hasn’t fared well in recent years. In 2009, an electrical fire killed one crewman. In 2012, the ship broke down off the coast of France and had to be towed by the navy tug Nikolay Chiker. In 2016, Kuznetsov lost two airplanes in two weeks, both reportedly due to faulty arresting wires during the aircraft recovery process.<br /><br /><br />Source: Popular Mechanics{% endraw %}
