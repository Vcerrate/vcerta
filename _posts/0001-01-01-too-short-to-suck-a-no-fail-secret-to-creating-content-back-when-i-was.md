{% raw %}Back when I was in a dance-theatre company, we had a rule of thumb when it came to our shows. Anything that we created had to be &quot;too short to suck.&quot; Those who liked our work would want more, and those who didn't would feel relieved we hadn't wasted more of their time. This is an excellent guideline to follow when creating content. You don't have to prove yourself by giving more than is necessary.<br /><br />Orion is a licensed psychologist in the state of California.<br />Podcast available on Spotify, Instagram, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, and others.<br />See the &quot;About&quot; tab for more information on donations and consultations.<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oriontarabanpsyd.com">https://oriontarabanpsyd.com</a><br /><br />#creator #brevity #nofail{% endraw %}
