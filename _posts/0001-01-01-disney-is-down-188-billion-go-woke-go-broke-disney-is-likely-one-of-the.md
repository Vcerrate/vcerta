{% raw %}Disney is likely one of the most nostalgic companies in the world as they have not only been a large part of our childhoods but our parents’ and grandparents’ childhoods as well. Disney has literally been a childhood classic for nearly 100 years at this point. Aside from their nostalgia factor, Disney runs a pretty unique business that can thrive in a multitude of environments. If people are staying at home and traveling less, that’s perfect for Disney’s streaming business. Conversely, if people are going out, that’s perfect for Disney’s box office sales and theme parks. Despite these unique advantages though, Disney isn’t doing that great. In fact, Disney stock is down about 50% from their all-time highs. This can be linked to fears about sustained Disney+ growth, a net income that has struggled to recover, and blatant political entanglement. While I feel that Disney can easily overcome stagnation and a low net margin over time, the issue of political entanglement may haunt them for years to come. This video explains the shortfalls of Disney and what happened to Disney. <br /><br />Discord Community: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/SJUNWNt">https://discord.gg/SJUNWNt</a><br /><br />Timestamps: <br />0:00 - The State Of Disney<br />1:29 - Underwhelming Growth<br />4:25 - Underwhelming Recovery<br />7:29 - Go Woke Go Broke<br />9:19 - Future Outlook<br /><br />Thumbnail Credit: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3NC2zV6">https://bit.ly/3NC2zV6</a><br /><br />Resources: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/KQ4u7AtU">https://pastebin.com/KQ4u7AtU</a>{% endraw %}
