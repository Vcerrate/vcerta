{% raw %}Today we take a look at the new Deadside update 0.2.6, talk about whats new, whats changed, and what I think about the update overall. For those wondering, this isn't a huge major update, but its not a small one either. This is how monthly updates go anyways, not gonna be an insane amount of content every time. Also keep in mind, some of the stuff in this video might change, since it was filmed on an earlier version of the update. Big news soon, enjoy.<br /><br /><br />Come play on my Deadside server!
