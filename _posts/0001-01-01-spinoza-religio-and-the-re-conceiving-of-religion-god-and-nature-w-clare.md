{% raw %}Clare has recently written what I consider the best book on Spinoza entitled Spinoza's Religion. It was my great pleasure to get to talk deeply with Clare about Spinoza, devotion, religion, faith, God etc.  Her work demonstrates the central relevance of Spinoza to those seeking to understand religion and spirituality within a scientific worldview and the religion that is not a religion.{% endraw %}
