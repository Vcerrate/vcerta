{% raw %}FINA Swimming Coaches Golden Clinic, Doha (QAT)<br />30/11/2014<br /><br />Dirk Lange (GER) - Modern Breaststroke Using the Example of Cameron vd Burgh: <br /><br />This presentation discusses relevant training content and tools using the example of the specific special race skills used by Olympic, Commonwealth Champion and World Record Holder Cameron vd Burgh (London 2012 and Barcelona 2013).<br /><br />Based on a comparison of the 2012 and 2013 seasons, where vd Burgh became Olympic Champion as well as World Champion, are general discharges formed to modern breaststroke. The question is: is vd Burgh the future and is he the perfect example of a modern breaststroker?<br /><br />The presentation will show practical workout contents from vd Burgh, as well as an extensive analysis of his Olympic and World Championship races.<br /><br />The essential idea of the training philosophy is the 'Aerobic Stimulance Training' (AST). Here, although the aerobic capacity is permanently refreshed by special trainings, the workouts are not destroying vd Burgh's real strengths: the physical fitness and the total clean speed.<br /><br />The trick is to get the right balance between uploading aerobic capacity and using speed, technique and gym tools with the AST Conception.{% endraw %}
