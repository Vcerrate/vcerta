{% raw %}Ketanji Brown Jackson 2A<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3l0EhYZ">https://bit.ly/3l0EhYZ</a><br /><br />Ketanji Brown Jackson's race is a superficial accolade compared to what matters when nominating a Supreme court judge. I don't care if you were the first muppet baby on the Supreme Court; my question is, how are you going to protect the inherent principles of the constitution and, more specifically, how are you going to protect our rights under the Second Amendment.<br /><br />Jackson was asked about the Second Amendment during her nomination hearing, and her answers weren't exactly comforting.<br /><br />I want you to ask yourself this one question:<br /><br />What do you think she would say if they asked her if she believed women have a fundamental right to vote? <br /><br />Do you think she would say, &quot;The Supreme Court has established that women have a fundamental right to vote&quot;? <br /><br />No! she would say YES,  the same way she said yes when she was asked about the First Amendment:  <br /><br />Senator Chuck Grassley didn't ask her what the Supreme Court thought. <br /><br />He explicitly asked her what SHE thought, and she deflected to what the Supreme Court said, and there is only one reason I believe she would do that, she doesn't believe the 2nd Amendment is a fundamental right.<br /><br />She had no problem saying a simple yes to what was a loaded question about the 1st Amendment. Still, she can't even acknowledge on a personal level that she believes the 2nd Amendment is a fundamental right.<br /><br />But we haven't even got to the biggest irony about this.<br /><br />But when you look deeper, she's overwhelmingly supported by the anti-gun lobby like Everytown and The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun violence.<br /><br />Look, I could be wrong, but Joe Biden is one of if not the most anti-2A presidents in history, and he's the one who nominated Jackson.<br /><br />For the record, back when George W. Bush was president and Biden was a Senator, Bush wanted to Nominate Janice Rogers Brown, a black female conservative, to the Supreme court Biden threatened to filibuster her nomination.<br /><br />This ignorance about the second Amendment inspired me to design the IF You Know You Know Second Amendment shirt.<br /><br />The shirt is designed to get people to ask, &quot;If You Know, You Know What?&quot;<br /><br />You can educate people on what the Second Amendment says because it's written verbatim inside of the If You know You Know Letters. <br /><br />IYKYK The Second Amendment Merchandise<br />➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.mrcolionnoir.com/collections/iykyk-merchandise">https://shop.mrcolionnoir.com/collections/iykyk-merchandise</a><br />➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3l0EhYZ">https://bit.ly/3l0EhYZ</a><br /><br />If I Only Had One Concealed Carry - FREE Book<br />➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mrcolionnoir.com/start-here/">https://www.mrcolionnoir.com/start-here/</a><br /><br />To Order Your PRO 2A Hats Click Here: <br />➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.mrcolionnoir.com/collections/hats">https://shop.mrcolionnoir.com/collections/hats</a><br /><br />Help US Further our Pro Constitution, Pro 2A message:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.MrColionNoir.com/donate/">https://www.MrColionNoir.com/donate/</a><br /><br />FOLLOW ME ON:<br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mrcolionnoir">https://twitter.com/mrcolionnoir</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/colionnoir/">https://www.instagram.com/colionnoir/</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/COLIONNOIR/">https://www.facebook.com/COLIONNOIR/</a><br /><br />#KetanjiBrownJackson #ColionNoir{% endraw %}
