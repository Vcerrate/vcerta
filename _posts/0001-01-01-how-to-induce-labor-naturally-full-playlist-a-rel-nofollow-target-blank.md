Do not attempt without medical advice. <br /><br />Step 1: Relax<br />Release tension and stop worrying -- stress and anxiety will impede labor. Relax by soaking in a warm bath, getting a professional massage, or inhaling a soothing scent such as clary sage. <br /><br />Step 2: Meditate<br />Use visualization and meditation techniques. Close your eyes, breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth, and visualize your cervix gently opening and your baby being born. <br /><br />Step 3: Make love<br />Have sex with your partner. Semen has a labor-inducing hormone, and female orgasm can open the cervix as much as two centimeters.<br /><br />Tip<br />Elevate your hips after lovemaking to help the semen stay on the cervix and encourage thinning and dilation. <br /><br />Step 4: Enjoy tropical fruits<br />Eat tropical fruits, such as kiwi, mango, and pineapple, which contain an enzyme that may cause mild contractions.<br /><br />Step 5: Apply pressure<br />Seek out an acupuncture or acupressure specialist -- focusing pressure on key areas of the body has helped some women. <br /><br />Step 6: Dial-up activity<br />Swing in the park or drive down a bumpy road to shift your baby into a delivery position. Take a slow walk or pedal gently on a stationary bike to enlist gravity's help in opening the cervix -- and speeding the arrival of your bundle of joy.<br /><br />Did You Know?<br />Did you know? More than 4.3 million babies are born in the U.S. every year -- that's nearly 12,000 new babies every day.{% endraw %}
