{% raw %}Money Market accounts explained in simple, easy to understand terms. In today's video, I take a look at a type of account you might not be too familiar with - a money market account. I'll explain how money market accounts are different than savings and checking accounts. And I'll explain the best use for a money market account. Your bank or credit union probably offers this type of account, so maybe you'll consider opening one.<br /><br />Have you used a money market account before?
