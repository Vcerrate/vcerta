{% raw %}During a process called “bolting”, the man seen in video was clearing loose rocks when a major rock fall occurred. Mountaineer Stefan Barthel and his crew were developing new sports climbing routes in Chulilla, Spain when they captured this amazing moment. <br /><br />Luckily, the area is remote and no other people were around. While it is not common for such large rocks to become loose and fall, proper safety precautions were taken and no one was hurt.<br /><br />Credit: Stefan Barthel via Storyful<br /><br />-------------<br />For Storyful Newswire subscription inquiries, please contact sales@storyful.com<br /><br />For advertising and brand opportunities please email: creative.global@storyful.com<br /><br />To license a video for editorial use please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://video.storyful.com">https://video.storyful.com</a><br /> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/storyful">https://twitter.com/storyful</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Storyful">https://www.facebook.com/Storyful</a>{% endraw %}
