{% raw %}Let me show you life in Russia 3 months after my country started the “operation” and got under sanctions.<br /><br />I recorded this video in my hometown, the city of Omsk in Siberia. But it’s more or less similar to what I can see in St. Petersburg and Moscow. Life in Russia under sanctions feels weird, I observe prices rising for nearly everything here, shopping malls are getting empty, and yet many people don’t think anything is going wrong.<br /><br />Support my channel:<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/nikiproshin">https://www.patreon.com/nikiproshin</a><br />Crypto wallets: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nikiproshin.com/donations">https://www.nikiproshin.com/donations</a><br /><br />My daily updates on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/nikiproshin">https://www.instagram.com/nikiproshin</a><br />My Telegram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/nikiproshin">https://t.me/nikiproshin</a><br />✍️ Reach me at nikiproshin@protonmail.com<br /><br />#russia #lifeinrussia{% endraw %}
