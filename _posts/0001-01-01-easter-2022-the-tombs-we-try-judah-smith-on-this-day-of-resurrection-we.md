{% raw %}On this day of resurrection, we remember the ultimate gift solely by Jesus giving up his life. God loves us despite any rules we follow, our efforts, our goodness, the information we know, or the ceremonies we take part in. In fact, none of that matters to him. Jesus died and rose again, so that we'd come to him as we are - not by what we do.<br /><br />WHO WE ARE<br />We are a community built on the life and teachings of Jesus. God loves you, and his arms are open wide to welcome people home. Everyone belongs here.<br /><br />CONNECT WITH US<br />Churchome’s Official Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.churchome.org/">https://www.churchome.org/</a><br />Churchome’s Free Mobile App: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://churchomeglobal.app.link/EFnguslTzR">https://churchomeglobal.app.link/EFnguslTzR</a><br /><br />Musicbed Sync ID code:<br />MB013BVKGNAOA0T{% endraw %}
