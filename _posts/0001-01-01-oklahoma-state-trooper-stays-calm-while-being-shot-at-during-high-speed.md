{% raw %}* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *<br />Oklahoma City, Oklahoma — The Oklahoma Highway Patrol released dashcam and bodycam footage of Trooper Brack Miller engaged in a high-speed pursuit of a black SUV on the Turner Turnpike in Oklahoma City back on Saturday, April 2. During the chase, the suspect, 32-year-old Charles Carswell, opened fire on the officer, striking his patrol car several times. <br /><br />On April 2, OHP was notified by an agency in Sedona, Ariz. to be on the lookout for armed robbery suspect, Charles Carswell. Troopers spotted the vehicle in Canadian County and attempted to pull the driver over. However, Carswell refused to stop and led troopers on a chase. The video showed Trooper Brack Miller from three different angles, pursuing the Carswell, who was fleeing from authorities. Entering Kilpatrick Turnpike, Carswell could be seen firing shots through his vehicle's rear window, and Trooper Miller is seen on-camera bobbing and weaving from his driver's seat. <br /><br />Eventually, Miller was able to tactically ram Carswell's vehicle, ending the pursuit. Carswell got out of the vehicle with a rifle and started shooting at troopers while barricaded behind the SUV. Troopers and officers fired back at Carswell, where he was struck and killed on the scene. Two troopers were injured but are expected to recover. As is the case with any incident in which shots are fired, troopers returned fire on the suspect. However, that footage hasn’t been released to the public pending an investigation.<br /><br />Donate to PoliceActivity: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity">https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity</a><br />Like us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PoliceActivity">https://www.facebook.com/PoliceActivity</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Police_Activity">https://twitter.com/Police_Activity</a>{% endraw %}
