This best deck in clash royale can be played in any arena to great success. Due to the abundance of splash damage, this clash royale magic archer deck allows you to melt mid ladder decks and activate king tower regardless of your card levels. Miner wall breaker magic archer decks are some of the highest skill decks in the game, but they will show you how to play magic archer and make you a better player. This miner wall breaker deck uses my favorite card in the game to its highest potential, and I highly recommend playing this miner wallbreaker deck in ladder or any clash royale tournament.<br /><br />Check out the RoyaleAPI deck stats here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://royaleapi.com/decks/stats/bomb-tower,fireball,magic-archer,miner,spear-goblins,tornado,valkyrie,wall-breakers">https://royaleapi.com/decks/stats/bomb-tower,fireball,magic-archer,miner,spear-goblins,tornado,valkyrie,wall-breakers</a><br /><br />I stream almost EVERY DAY at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/sirtagcr">https://www.twitch.tv/sirtagcr</a> - typically before 1 PM ET.

I mostly will play miner poison decks, control decks, and decks with any clash royale new cards that are released. The miner is my favorite clash royale legendary card, and I will typically play clash royale miner control decks the most. The decks I play are great for clash royale 12 win grand challenges, clash royale trophy pushing on ladder, and for clash royale tournaments and clan wars. I hope you guys enjoy my pro tips and tricks and my beginner tips and tricks, and I'll see you in the arena!<br /><br />#ClashRoyale #MagicArcherDeck #BestMagicArcherDeck #Clash #Royale #ClashRoyal #Miner #MinerPoison #hogrider #hog #deck #bestdeck #best #deck{% endraw %}
