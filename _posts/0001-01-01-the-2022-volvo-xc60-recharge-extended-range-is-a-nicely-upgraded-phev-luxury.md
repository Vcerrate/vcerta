{% raw %}When #Volvo first introduced their T8 Plug-in Hybrid powertrain, it was a huge leap forward into the electrified space for the company. As the industry continues to move on, the #XC60Recharge gets a massive upgrade to keep it competitive. For 2022, there will be two different models, the #VolvoXC60Recharge and a new version with an extended range battery. The upgraded battery now includes up to 35 miles of EV only range, an additional 55 HP for a total of 455 and 523 lb-ft of torque, and Volvo claims the #XC60 #Recharge will get to 60 in just 4.5 seconds. <br /><br />We're also on:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/redline_reviews">https://www.instagram.com/redline_reviews</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/liketheredline">https://www.facebook.com/liketheredline</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tweettheredline">https://twitter.com/tweettheredline</a>{% endraw %}
