Unfortunately enough many havenâ€™t even addressed it with the man in question. They donâ€™t know how to ask for what they need. Too often women are intimidated away from asking for more. Many men draw harsh lines and are unwilling to to certain things for the woman they claim to love. Sometimes when men lack affection itâ€™s trauma based. Other times when men lack affection itâ€™s just an innocent indifference and unawareness. The problem is lack of affection can lead to intimacy issues or the destruction of ones self esteem if youâ€™re the person being neglected physically. It creates a very unhealthy relationship dynamic for two people to have extremely different affection needs and requirements. Be very careful allowing yourself to stay in relationships where a person isnâ€™t willing to compromise what they can to meet you in the middle. Make sure you find out if your man is just unaware of the lack of affection he gives or adverse to giving more affection. A man whoâ€™s just naturally not affectionate can evolve while a man whoâ€™s unwilling likely needs counseling and will not prioritize trying to meet you halfway. You can work with a naturally non affectionate man, but cannot change a man unwilling or opposed to more affection. Compromise and consideration are also problems for that type of man and you should likely move on unless he seeks help with his intimacy issues.<br /><br /><br />When heâ€™s not affectionate <br />How to get what you want from a man<br />How to teach a man to love you{% endraw %}
