{% raw %}How to make French Baguette 2 using the quicker poolish method, easy step by step instructions from start to finish.<br /><br />Here are 4 simple rules to follow when making these wonderful Baguettes.<br />1. Stick to the recipe rigidly, the quantities and ingredients are very important and carefully worked out  for successful results.<br />2. Use digital SCALES for the measurements including the water, don't convert to cups or measuring jugs, they are too inaccurate. <br />3. Use proper bread flour with at least 12% protein, check the ingredients list on the side of the flour bag for the protein level, protein may show in grams per serving but just work it out, it needs to be 12g of protein per 100g of flour.  Plain or all purpose flour has a lower protein count and is great for pastries, cakes, and biscuits, but is not strong enough for making bread. <br />4. Very important...Check your yeast is working, BEFORE you start, you can do a yeast test as shown in my sandwich bread video here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpSbYV96_c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpSbYV96_c</a><br />Thank you again for watching, John ðŸ‘Œ<br /><br />CIABATTA made easy at home. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9ZvlKQmm6M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9ZvlKQmm6M</a><br />How to make Butter video <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NiuIIKOWbU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NiuIIKOWbU</a><br />Sandwich bread video  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpSbYV96_c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpSbYV96_c</a><br />How to make Dinner rolls video <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rosj1ZlLGlU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rosj1ZlLGlU</a><br /><br />Stage 1 The Poolish or Sponge<br />200g / 7oz  Strong white bread flour<br />300g / 300mls / 10Â½oz  Cold water<br />Â½tsp / 2g of instant or active dried yeast, if using fresh yeast 8 grams<br /><br />Stage 2   The main Ingredients<br />500g / 17Â½oz  Strong white bread flour<br />220g / 22omls / 7Â½oz  Cold water<br />1tsp / 8g Salt <br />The Poolish or Sponge made earlier<br /><br />Disclaimer <br />This is to certify that all of my videos on this channel are NOT being sponsored in any way, by any one at this moment in time.
