We speak the truth using the gifts of the Spirit to bring clarity to the body of Christ on issues that seem confusing in this modern age. Our goal is to guide the church body in such a way that connects ethics, values, character, and morals of our ancestors into the present and future generations by creatively bringing the wisdom of the past, the wisdom of The Ancient of Days, and the wisdom of our elders into the present, and striving to bridge the gaps of the generations in between. Together we teach on topics such as current issues, dream interpretation, learning how to hear God's voice, anointing, slaying sacred cows and so much more. We look forward to starting a relationship with you and watching you walk into the fullness of whom you are meant to be in Christ Jesus. <br /><br />Fireside Grace Ministries<br />Robyn and Brandi Cunningham{% endraw %}
