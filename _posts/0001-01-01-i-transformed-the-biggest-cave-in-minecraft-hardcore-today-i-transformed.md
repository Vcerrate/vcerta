{% raw %}Today I Transformed the BIGGEST Cave in Minecraft Hardcore. At least the biggest one I've ever found. And there's still so much more room for improvement.<br /><br />⚠️Watch from EPISODE 1 if you haven't already! ⚠️<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/nfKHEPUbPhg">https://youtu.be/nfKHEPUbPhg</a><br /><br />🐤 Follow me on Twitter! 🐤<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ezyyhd">https://twitter.com/ezyyhd</a><br /><br />👔 For Business enquiries message me on the twitter account above or email: <br />- ezyyhd@gmail.com<br /><br />World Seed: 6218651098449780159<br />Cave is at about -1000 / 0<br /><br />Texture Pack: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vanillatweaks.net/share#0oxSjn">https://vanillatweaks.net/share#0oxSjn</a><br /><br />🎵 Music 🎵<br /><br />* I do not own any of the songs used in this video, majority of the music is from www.epidemicsound.com and incompetech.com *<br /><br />This series is inspired mainly by Wadzee and aCookieGod. Maybe Sandiction as well. In this Hardcore world I'm planning to complete lots of challenges and mega builds and transform a lot of things. I've now built a Mega Base as well!<br /><br />👍 Once again. Thank you so much for watching the video and if you're reading this have an absolutely AMAZING day! 👍{% endraw %}
