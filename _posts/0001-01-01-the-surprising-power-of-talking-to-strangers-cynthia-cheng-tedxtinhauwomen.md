{% raw %}How many opportunities to meaningfully connect with people do we pass up everyday? Can a stranger change our life? After interviewing 100+ shift workers around the city, Cynthia implores us to discover the power of connecting with strangers. Cynthia is a writer, lawyer and a keen storyteller. She is passionate about sharing heart-warming stories of people in our community who are often overlooked. She co-founded a social impact storytelling platform, Hong Kong Shifts, to showcase these stories through words and visuals to foster meaningful connections and create a positive impact in our community. She interviews and narrates captivating accounts of shift workers – street cleaners, taxi drivers, janitors and others – and brings to light their silent contributions to keep this city moving like a well-oiled machine. Through these compelling stories, Cynthia hopes to bridge the social gap, build empathy and shift perspectives. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
