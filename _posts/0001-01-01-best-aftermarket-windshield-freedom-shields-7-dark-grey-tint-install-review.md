{% raw %}It is sometimes a minefield trying to find the right replacement product when you are replacing the OEM Harley parts, that many vendors and the so called &quot;cool companies&quot; have the markets wrapped up right? Wrong! Sometimes you find a gem in the rough and that's what I found when searching for a new windshield for my 2021 Street Glide Special. <br /><br />Freedom Shields are exactly that, I gem in the rough, great company with great products. When dealing with these guys I found them to be very personable and extremely easy to work with, and their prices are awesome. In this video I give you my honest opinion on this awesome after market windshield. <br /><br />Freedom Shields Website here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://freedomshields.net/">https://freedomshields.net/</a> <br /><br />Check out Freedom Shields Street Glide Shields here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://freedomshields.net/product/street-glide-windshield/">https://freedomshields.net/product/street-glide-windshield/</a> <br /><br />MY SOCIALS AND MERCH<br /><br />👉🏻Patreon : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/​TheMilitaryBiker">https://www.patreon.com/​TheMilitaryBiker</a><br />👉🏻Instagram : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/The_Military_Biker​">https://www.instagram.com/The_Military_Biker​</a><br />👉🏻Merch : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://the-military-biker-store.myteespring.co">https://the-military-biker-store.myteespring.co</a> <br />👉🏻TikTok - @The_Military_Biker<br />👉🏻Twitter - @TheMilitaryBike<br />👉🏻Facebook Page - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheMilitaryBiker">https://www.facebook.com/TheMilitaryBiker</a> <br />👉🏻Music Source Epidemic Sound <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/hz6clo">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/hz6clo</a><br /><br />Join the Military Biker Membership program to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqxj5M-qedJagbPuaC7tNNg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqxj5M-qedJagbPuaC7tNNg/join</a><br /><br />I’m supporting the Rolling Barrage 2022 in aid of PTSD Awareness and Mental Health among our Military and First Responders.
