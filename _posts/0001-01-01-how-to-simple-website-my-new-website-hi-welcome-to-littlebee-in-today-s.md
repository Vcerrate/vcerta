{% raw %}Hi, welcome to LittleBee - In today's video How to simple website | My new website show you how easy it is to create your own website.<br /><br />Link to my website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.little-bee.pl">https://www.little-bee.pl</a> - Test and let me know if everything works fine.<br /><br />I hope I explained correctly at the beginning that I don't do my site through WIX. But if you find this also difficult I recommend you to look at WIX or Editor X. I don't mean to and I'm not advertising them I'm just saying it's really easy.<br /><br />But with the web templates I want to show you it's not hard either. Just download the optimized template and edit your texts, insert your photos etc.<br /><br />As you can see in the video it's not hard at all. It's not hard to create your own website today. Yes it took me almost a month but I didn't spend much time on it. I spent some time learning the basics of HTML and then just edited the template and inserted my photos and links.<br /><br />What do you think ? Did I get my website right? I'm not a pro but I'm happy about it :) . <br />If you run into any problems be sure to let me know so I can try to fix them.<br /><br />Thank you :)<br />______________________________________________________<br />My Website : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.little-bee.pl">https://www.little-bee.pl</a><br />My Instagram : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/little_becca_bee">http://instagram.com/little_becca_bee</a><br />My PayPal - If you want support me/buy me Gift: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3u0o1Lj">https://bit.ly/3u0o1Lj</a><br /><br />#LittleBee #web #website #www{% endraw %}
