{% raw %}We back at it, trying to get to 5 stacks of Hex: Pentimento. We decided to go with Demogorgon this time, since he is a pretty mobile killer with a lot of good chase potential. If you have suggestions on other killers/builds to help get our goal, let me know in the comments!<br /><br />Thumbnail render made by Ev3ntic!
