{% raw %}A simple lyric video of &quot;Yet this will I call to mind&quot; also often referred to as &quot;Because of The Lord's Great Love&quot;&quot; written by Carl Tuttle.  <br /><br />Created for use in church services during worship.  <br /><br />This is another relatively rare song from the 90's.  It can found on the 1992 Vineyard album 'Send Your Spirit - Touching the Father's Heart Vol 14'  where it is called 'Because of The Lord's Great Love'.  However I first heard it on the Kingsway Compilation Album &quot;New Songs 93/94 - Volume 2' where it is called 'Yet this will I call to mind' - the name it is also referred to in SongSelect.<br /><br />I do not own copyright of this song.
