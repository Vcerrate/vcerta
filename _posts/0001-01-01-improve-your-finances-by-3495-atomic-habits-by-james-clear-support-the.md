If you splurge now, you still didn’t go broke. But keep doing this over time, and you’ll see some real changes. <br /><br />Almost half of all New Year’s resolutions are about personal finances. Only 16% of all New Year’s resolutions succeed, which means that many promises that we make ourselves about both finances and other important topics, are broken. That begs the question – Why is this so difficult? Why do people continue making promises to themselves that they cannot keep? And, perhaps most importantly, is there a way out of this infinite loop of disappointment? The answer to these questions lies within our habits. <br /><br />---<br /><br />Top 5 takeaways of Atomic Habits by James Clear:<br /><br />00:00 Intro<br />01:02 1.

How to become a millionaire? There are many ways to get there – investing in the stock market, becoming a stock trader, doing real estate investing, or why not becoming an entrepreneur? But whether you are interested in how to invest in stocks or investing strategies for creating passive income with rental properties – I hope to be able to provide you with a solution (or at least an idea) here. Warren Buffett - the greatest investor of our time - says that you should fill your mind with competing ideas and then see what makes sense to you. This channel is about filling your mind with those ideas. And in the process – upgrading your money-making toolbox.{% endraw %}
