{% raw %}Dr. Ellen Schwartzbard, Obstetrician and Gynecologist with Baptist Health South Florida, advises trying to avoid to take any medication at all during the first trimester of pregnancy, but itâ€™s absolutely necessary to take something for cold or allergies. She recommends consulting with the physician. <br /> <br />After this time, she affirms it is a little bit safer to take a larger variation of medication.{% endraw %}
