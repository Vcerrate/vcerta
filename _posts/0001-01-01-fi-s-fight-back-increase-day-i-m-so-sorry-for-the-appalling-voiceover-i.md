{% raw %}I’m so sorry for the appalling voiceover - I’m currently really not very well and managing a horrible cough and sore throat. <br />Muller rices used to be one of my favourite desserts, but I’ve not touched one for over a year. It easy easy, but we did it 💪🏻 <br />Now… time for rest and for me to get better! <br />#anorexiarecovery #inpatient #eatingdisorderrecovery #edrecovery #recovery #recoveryispossible #dayinthelife{% endraw %}
