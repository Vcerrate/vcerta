{% raw %}Sounds impossible right? Well you might be surprised to know that it is actually a mental overlay that greats the experience of &quot;this over here is different than that over there.&quot; I know it sounds crazy, but it is true and it is possible to experience this &quot;non-separation&quot; as an ongoing experience.<br /><br />MY BOOK (Awake: Itâ€™s Your Turn): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/2hjbf5m2">https://tinyurl.com/2hjbf5m2</a><br />FREE GUIDED MEDITATION APP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simply-awake/id1544382796">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simply-awake/id1544382796</a><br />WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simplyalwaysawake.com/">https://simplyalwaysawake.com/</a><br />RETREAT INFO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simplyalwaysawake.com/retreats/">https://simplyalwaysawake.com/retreats/</a><br /><br />About my videos: These videos are a resource for anyone wishing to wake up from the dream of separation. Awakening, enlightenment, and liberation are becoming far more mainstream possibilities than they once were. There are many good teachers out there, and if you resonate with the teachings of Eckhart Tolle, Rupert Spira, or Sadhguru, you might find resources here that address these deeper promptings to investigate your true nature.{% endraw %}
