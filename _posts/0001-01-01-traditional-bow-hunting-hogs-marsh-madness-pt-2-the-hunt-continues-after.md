{% raw %}The hunt continues! After spending the first few days filming for me as we staked around the marsh in search of hogs with the traditional bow, Xander is finally feeling confident enough to take his longbow out. We switch spots and I pick up the camera to see if we can get this new hunter a close shot at a hog. Meanwhile, Benji is still off on his own carrying his recurve in search of a boar. Hunting is, in large part, about food. But it goes much farther, deeper than that. Traditional Bow Hunting is often about the experience as well. <br /><br />Don't forget to subscribe to the channel.
