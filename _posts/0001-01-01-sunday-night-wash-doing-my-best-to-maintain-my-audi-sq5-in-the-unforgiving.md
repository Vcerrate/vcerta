{% raw %}#CARWASH #TURTLEWAX #BILTHAMBER<br /><br />📋 𝗣 𝗥 𝗢 𝗝 𝗘 𝗖 𝗧   𝗢 𝗩 𝗘 𝗥 𝗩 𝗜 𝗘 𝗪<br />Maintaining a clean car in the winter is basically a full-time job. On Sunday, I decided to hit the exterior of my SQ5 to help raise my spirits. Washing my car is something I enjoy, but when you do it as often as I do, it can become routine. To keep life exciting, I decided to integrate some new products into today's process. I used five products that are relatively recent additions to my arsenal: <br /><br />📦 𝗡 𝗘 𝗪   𝗦 𝗧 𝗨 𝗙 𝗙<br />➤ Turtle Wax Super Foam Wheel &amp; Tire Cleaner<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/3hnv8tek">https://tinyurl.com/3hnv8tek</a><br />➤ Bilt Hamber Auto-Foam<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/2p82sxmw">https://tinyurl.com/2p82sxmw</a><br />➤ TAC System Mystic Bubble Shampoo<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/5dpyww2m">https://tinyurl.com/5dpyww2m</a><br />➤ Turtle Wax Hybrid Solutions Graphene Acrylic Tire Shine<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/2p8sz7bt">https://tinyurl.com/2p8sz7bt</a><br />➤ P&amp;S Renny Doyle Double Black Paint Gloss Showroom Spray N Shine <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/wh68yzvw">https://tinyurl.com/wh68yzvw</a><br /><br />I was satisfied with the user experience and performance of each product used in this project. I feel the mixture ratio was a bit off on the Auto-Foam but its cleaning abilities were very apparent. I share a few insights into these products during the wrap up of the video so be sure to watch it all the way through. It is my sincere hope you enjoy this video and let me know if you have any questions.
