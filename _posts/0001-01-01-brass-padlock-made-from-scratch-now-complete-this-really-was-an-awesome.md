{% raw %}This really was an awesome project, it had a bit of everything, hand tool work and machining, as well as being functional and also some stylish elements. It was one of my favourite projects to make.<br />I was going to make the video in three parts, you would've got the second part much earlier but many of you showed a preference to single videos so I finished it in this second part.<br /><br />My 7 Plan Bundle: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paskmakes.com/the-pask-makes-7-woodworking-plans-bundle/">https://paskmakes.com/the-pask-makes-7-woodworking-plans-bundle/</a><br /><br />As always I'm happy to answer any questions. <br /><br />If you would like to support this channel you can do so here<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/PaskMakes">https://www.patreon.com/PaskMakes</a><br /><br />You can also help me out by purchasing one of my shirts, you can find them here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paskmakes.threadless.com">https://paskmakes.threadless.com</a><br /><br />Check out my new website<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://paskmakes.com/">http://paskmakes.com/</a><br /><br />Check out my Instagram to see more of my work <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/paskmakes/">https://www.instagram.com/paskmakes/</a><br /><br />Also you can check out my photography at my website (nothing to do with making but you may be interested in what I do) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.neilpaskinphotography.com">http://www.neilpaskinphotography.com</a><br />My email can be found in the about section of this channel.<br /><br />For real mail,<br /><br />Pask Makes<br />P.O BOX 768<br />Yandina<br />Queensland<br />4561<br />Australia{% endraw %}
