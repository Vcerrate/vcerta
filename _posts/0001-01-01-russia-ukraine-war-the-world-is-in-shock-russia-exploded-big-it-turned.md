{% raw %}It turned out that a design flaw was behind the tank losses inflicted by Russia in Ukraine. Russia, which suffered bigger losses than it had ever expected after the war it launched in Ukraine on February 24, experienced the biggest shock when it lost military equipment. According to the US-based think tank Rand Corporation and the UK-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, Russia had 2,700 tanks at the beginning of the invasion. However, later in the war, destroyed and abandoned images of Russian tanks revealed that Russia had a serious problem. Although Russia's losses were attributed to advanced anti-tank weapons supplied by the West, the real truth has emerged. He ignored the fatal design error that turned the Moscow vehicles that drove Soviet-era tanks into the field into 'walking coffins' for the Ukrainian war, and the result was a complete fiasco. So what is the fatal mistake in Russian tanks? Unlike Western tanks, tanks become vulnerable to possible accidents because 40 shells are stacked in the cylinder chamber located in the turret of Russian tanks. Any firing from tanks can cause a chain reaction in the chamber and cause all the ammunition to explode at the same time. &quot;Any shot that causes a reaction fires ammunition, causing a massive explosion, and the turret literally blows up,&quot; Sam Bendett, a consultant at the Center for New American Security, told CNN, noting that the main problem with Russian tanks is a design flaw.{% endraw %}
