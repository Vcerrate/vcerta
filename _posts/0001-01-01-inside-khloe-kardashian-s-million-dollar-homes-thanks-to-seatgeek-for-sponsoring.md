From their wardrobes to their real estate, the KarJenner clan love luxurious homes. So, it’s no surprise Khloe Kardashian spent millions on her property to build her dream home from scratch, $17 million to be exact. While her neighbor, mother and momager, Kris Jenner paid a $20-million bill for her share of the 1.5 acres their properties sit on.<br />Khloe’s home has at least 8 rooms and 9.5 bathrooms perfect for the queen she is. You already know everything is organized perfectly, just the way Khloe likes it.<br />Like her pantry, she spent $2,000 solely on cubbies and jars to organize pantry essentials, like dill pickles, flour, pasta, and condiments.<br />The mansion also comes with an 8-car garage, a gym perfect for Khloe’s fitness needs, a pool with a spa, a basketball court and perfectly manicured lawns that surround the 10,000 square-foot property.<br /> <br />Despite some drama in the beginning, with a contractor that ran off with their money and the deeds and allegedly had a long rap sheet, their dream homes are finally built and decorated to her taste.<br />We’re sure as the new Keeping Up season rolls out we’ll get to see more of the finished mansion, but for now this is all we get from Khloe. What are some of your favorite features and amenities in her new mansion? Let us know in the comments!
