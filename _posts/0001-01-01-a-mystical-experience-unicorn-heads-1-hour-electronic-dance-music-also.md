{% raw %}Electronic dance music, also known as dance music, club music, or simply dance, is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves and festivals.<br /><br />#dance<br />#electronic<br />#unicornheads<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbDplVvtIq05AdyYKjVSUIw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbDplVvtIq05AdyYKjVSUIw</a><br />#dark <br /><br />To break the ice press this link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/35cI8tr">https://bit.ly/35cI8tr</a><br /><br />You may ask why there are many repetitions of the same song? Well to enjoy the candy you need to eat several pieces. To really enjoy the song you may listen to it a couple of times. <br />On a mobile browser, I find it difficult to set the repeat option, for some reason, so I created these 1h song sessions. Pick a song and enjoy your hour.<br /><br />! 1 Hour Wave{% endraw %}
