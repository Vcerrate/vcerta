{% raw %}Vladimir Putin sent up strategic nuclear-capable bombers into the skies over Western Russia today amid huge pressure on the Kremlin over the calamitous sinking of the  Moskva flagship in the Black Sea last week.<br /><br />Videos from today and Saturday caught four of the aircraft - used to carry nuclear bombs - over the Kaluga region, between Moscow and the Ukrainian border. The planes are believed to be Russian Tu-95s, known as Bears, and appeared to be flying in striking distance of Ukraine.<br /><br />The Defence Ministry in Moscow had not immediately announced the purpose of the mission. The Tu-95s have been used a number of times to strike targets in Ukraine with non-nuclear weapons, notably Kh-55 and Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles. The super-loud Tu-95 is the only propeller-powered strategic bomber still in operational use today, and the plane first flew 70 years ago.{% endraw %}
