{% raw %}There is significant downside potential in the stock market, says portfolio manager Tavi Costa. The technology sector may suffer from the re-opening of the economy as fears of the virus subside. Gold and silver underperformed compared to other commodities last year, and Tavi sees it's time for the metals to play catch-up. High inflation is here to stay, he says, which should also push gold higher.<br /><br />Find Tavi online: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.crescat.net">https://www.crescat.net</a><br /><br />0:55 Stock market crash<br />8:35 Re-opening economy<br />11:59 Gold &amp; silver forecast<br />_____________________________<br />Subscribe for our FREE newsletter - #1 place for gold &amp; silver news &amp; commentary: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://libertyandfinance.com">http://libertyandfinance.com</a><br />_____________________________<br />BUY SILVER &amp; GOLD at the best price of any listed dealer and support this channel!<br />CALL US: 1-888-81-LIBERTY (1-888-815-4237)<br />or email your name and phone number to LibertyAndFinance@Protonmail.com<br /><br />Social Media links<br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/LibertyAndFinance">https://www.youtube.com/LibertyAndFinance</a><br />Soundcloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/LibertyAndFinance">https://soundcloud.com/LibertyAndFinance</a><br />Rumble: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rumble.com/c/LibertyandFinance">https://rumble.com/c/LibertyandFinance</a><br />Brighteon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.brighteon.com/channels/dunagun">https://www.brighteon.com/channels/dunagun</a><br />Odysee: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://odysee.com/@LibertyAndFinance">https://odysee.com/@LibertyAndFinance</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/LibertyAndFinance/">https://www.facebook.com/LibertyAndFinance/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DunagunKaiser">https://twitter.com/DunagunKaiser</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.Patreon.com/ReluctantPreppers">https://www.Patreon.com/ReluctantPreppers</a> <br /><br />Donate to Support Our Mission!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.Patreon.com/ReluctantPreppers">https://www.Patreon.com/ReluctantPreppers</a> <br />or<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/ReluctantPreppers">https://www.paypal.me/ReluctantPreppers</a><br />_____________________________<br />Liberty and Finance LLC receives financial compensation from its sponsors.
