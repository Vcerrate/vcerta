{% raw %}The Peugeot 5008 SUV Is a Surprisingly Good Contender! [Car Review]<br /><br />The 2022 Peugeot 5008 SUV stayed with me for 1 week, and I got to test the 2022 Peugeot 5008 SUV quite well. In this Filipino car review, the 2022 Peugeot 5008 SUV gives a compelling case versus other 7 seater SUVs in its price category, like the Mazda CX8 and the Honda CRV. The 2022 Peugeot 5008 SUV is the flagship SUV in the line up, sporting 7 seats and is categorized as a midsize crossover SUV. The 2022 Peugeot 5008 SUV was formerly an MPV class, but in 2017, it has been reclassified as a crossover SUV. Peugeot Philippines seeks to carve its own niche in the Philippine automotive industry, and the 2022 Peugeot 5008 SUV will help achieve that. <br /><br />Song: M.I.M.E x The LJ - Push The Gas [NCS Release]<br />Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds<br />Free Download/Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://NCS.io/PushTheGas">http://NCS.io/PushTheGas</a><br />Watch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/0SZnFt1oAEc">http://youtu.be/0SZnFt1oAEc</a><br /><br />#PeugeotPh #5008SUV #Peugeot{% endraw %}
