{% raw %}With Pattaya now relaxing Bar Times slightly, lets take a look away from the Centre of Town to the Famous Soi 6 and 6/1. We also visit Soi 7 and Soi 8  Walking Street and finish off with a previous nights footage going from Dolphin to Naklua Soi 18 (Subscriber Request)<br /><br />All rides filmed in 4K by a geriatric old guy who is taking his life in his hands on a Bicycle. Enjoy the tour<br /><br />To view the new channel just use this link.
