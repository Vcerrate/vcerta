{% raw %}If you are looking for some hair-raising creepy videos to keep you hooked and freeze you enough that you don't feel like turning off the light, this bone-chilling scary list ought to do the trick. For the entire past week, I scoured the web to find the best content to analyze, and here I am with 15 of the most unsettling, fear-inducing, and honestly the scariest videos around. What you are about to watch is a collection of scary videos that are freaking viewers out helplessly. So, ready yourself.<br /> <br />All of the entries in this list deserve your shivers and screams. So if you are a horror aficionado hoping to engross yourself in something spine-chilling, just lock your room, sit back, and prepare yourself for a riveting night of frights. Because the creepy videos in this list tap into every person's gravest nightmare: being all alone at night, completely unaware of the dark and unknown forces that lurk in the shadows. These scary videos will leave you utterly reeling and make you indefensibly battle the invisible forces that torment your psyche.<br /> <br />Now, why on earth did I even decide to make a list analyzing such videos? For the same reason I turned to reading scary stories — to chase that next level. Even if you haven't been a horror fan for long, you know that the more you watch any horror flicks or creepy videos, the less spooky they get. On the first watch, some scary videos may paralyze you with profound dread, but when you watch them again, the uncanniness fades. And the more you rewatch, the plainer they feel.<br /> <br />However, the moment I stumbled across the entries included in this list of creepy videos, I realized they were different. Call it my horror sense, but I knew the more times anyone watches them, the worse they're going to hit each time. These scary videos will keep on terrifying you with each watch, time and again — bringing about a piercing fear of the dark and the mysterious that will creep into your everyday life, and you might even find yourself wishing you never came across this list of scary videos. I am not kidding — not for one second — when I say that these creepy videos will make you jump right out of your skin!<br /> <br />A great many times, the most shivery of chills come from the places you least expect them in. You don't have to visit a haunted house or chance upon a ghost to get freaked out of your wits. Even watching something like the grimly macabre scary videos that I have here for you may very well creep under your skin and throw you in a spiral of endless frights.<br /> <br />Once things start going bump in the night, you can't help but feel your heart right in your mouth. So, be very honest when assessing whether or not you should watch this collection of creepy videos — are you someone who often gets recommended by their friends to grow a pair? If that's the case, seriously, leave. I warn you, watching these creepy videos is nothing like watching the mindless scary TikTok videos the gen Z is so hooked on; the ones in front of you are pure nightmare fuel. But, if you think you are up for the challenge, go ahead.<br /> <br />Done watching? That's great!<br />Which of these scary videos made you shudder the most?
