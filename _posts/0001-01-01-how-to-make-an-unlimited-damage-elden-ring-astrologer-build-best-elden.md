{% raw %}How to Make an UNLIMITED DAMAGE Elden Ring Astrologer Build! BEST Elden Ring Mage Build Guide. We are taking a look at a new Elden Ring astrologer build guide that gives you an unlimited amount of damage. This Elden Ring mage build guide uses 1 spell, rock blaster to deal huge amounts of damage that build up over time, very quickly and even gives you the ability to move around whilst using it making it more effective than comet azur. This is the best Elden Ring astrologer build I have used in a while and I don't think there are many other Elden Ring mage build spells that will give you this much damage in a short amount of time plus there is a certain way to use this spell that will consume 0 FP. This is a how to guide as I will show you what you need to do to utilise this build the best way possible.
