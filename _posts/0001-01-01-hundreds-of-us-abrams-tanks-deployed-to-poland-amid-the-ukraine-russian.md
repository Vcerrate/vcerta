{% raw %}Hundreds of US Abrams Tanks deployed to Poland Amid The Ukraine-Russian-Crisis.<br /><br />US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced on Friday the planned sale of 250 Abrams tanks to Poland, as Washington moves to strengthen the defenses of a key eastern European ally amid a mounting threat of war between neighboring Ukraine and Russia.<br /><br />&quot;This is the most modern version of the Abrams, and will provide Poland with a highly-advanced tank capability,&quot; Austin told a news conference following talks in Warsaw, adding that the delivery timeframe was under discussion.<br /><br />&quot;It will also strengthen our interoperability with the Polish armed forces, boosting the credibility of our combined deterrence efforts and those of our other NATO Allies.&quot;<br /><br />Poland push to accelerate Washington’s proposed sale of 250 M1A2 Abrams SEPv3 tanks to NATO ally Poland, which has been pending since last summer, in light of the escalating crisis with Russia.<br /><br />The ranking members of the House Armed Services Committee argue expediting the sale, “especially as Russia builds-up forces around Ukraine, would send an important message to both NATO and the Kremlin.”<br />#US #Poland #Europe #Russian #Ukraine{% endraw %}
