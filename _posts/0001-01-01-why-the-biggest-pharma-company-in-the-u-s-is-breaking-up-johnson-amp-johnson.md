{% raw %}Johnson &amp; Johnson, the biggest pharmaceutical company in the U.S. based on its market cap, announced in November 2021 it plans to spin off its consumer business into a new publicly-traded company by November 2023. Analysts overwhelmingly say it’s a smart business move, but it could also come with some risks. Watch the video above to learn why Johnson &amp; Johnson is splitting itself up and how investors are reacting.<br /><br />Johnson &amp; Johnson announced in November that it plans to spin off its consumer business into a new publicly traded company by November 2023.<br /><br />The news didn’t surprise Wall Street.<br /><br />“The analyst community has been talking about splitting up J&amp;J for years,” said Jared Holz, health-care equity strategist at Oppenheimer. “The timing situation is critical, just because people have been very curious or intrigued as to why now.”<br /><br />Johnson &amp; Johnson is the biggest pharmaceutical company in the United States based on market cap. It was ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 List of the largest U.S. corporations based on total revenue.

The company has been dealing with numerous legal challenges over the past several years, many of which are ongoing and could result in as-yet-unknown fines and settlements.<br /><br />» Subscribe to CNBC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic</a><br /><br />About CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.
