{% raw %}Performed live on September 18th, 2008 at the Memorial Hall of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, NC. Aired on October 23rd, 2008.<br />This is the MySpace sponsored (one-off) reunion concert, the first to kick off the Front to Back series. As far as I know, this is also the only Front to Back concert. The pro-shot and interviews are presented by NowWhat.com.<br /><br />The video is 2 encodes, one with a watermark and one without, so I just masked the watermark out with the other encode. I also added a faint resample that fades the frames, because the framerate was really inconsistent on the original. The audio is the same, me and a friend had a really complex solution before we found the higher quality audio. Army is swapped out for the version on the Retrospective. I don't think any video or audio of the encore exists except for Battle, which is on the Retrospective, but I do know what songs were played.<br /><br />☆Timestamps☆<br />00:00 Intro / Interview Pt. 1<br />00:32 Narcolepsy<br />06:18 Interview Pt. 2<br />07:29 Don't Change Your Plans<br />13:06 Mess<br />17:08 Interview Pt. 3<br />18:49 Magic<br />23:04 Interview Pt. 4<br />24:41 Hospital Song<br />26:58 Army<br />30:26 Interview Pt. 5<br />31:58 Your Redneck Past<br />36:01 Your Most Valuable Possession (feat.
