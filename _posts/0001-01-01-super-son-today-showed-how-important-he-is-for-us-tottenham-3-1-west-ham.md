{% raw %}TIMESTAMPS: <br />0:00 Intro<br />0:07 Sonny is a very good player and is a good person. He showed today that he is an important player for us. You can see the links between him, Kane and Kulusevski.  <br />2:47 Harry is brilliant in both phases on the pitch - when he scores or assists. He is two players in one, he can be a number 10 &amp; 9. <br />4:27 In our dressing room, there is only one target in mind, that is top 4. Tottenham as a club needs ambition to play in the best competitions. Arsenal at the moment are taking advantage and showing great stability as a club.<br />7:05 I like to fight to win, especially to win the Premier League. I am enjoying what I am doing with these players because I am now seeing improvement which is great. I want to enjoy seeing my players play football, now I am seeing really good football. <br />9:23 The only way to put pressure on Arsenal is to win games, 9 games to go and every game is a final for us. They have a good advantage but we have to win our games. <br />11:25 I have seen great improvement tactically and mentally in this team. West Ham tried to put pressure on us but we was calm and managed the game well. The level of every single player is improving and we are becoming a strong team. <br />13:20 It is a pity to have an international break in this moment, we are in good form. <br /><br />HaytersTV ‚Äì Football Up Close.
