{% raw %}Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, a Democrat representing suburban Metro Detroit communities, pushed back against a Republican colleague who falsely accused her of wanting to “groom and sexualize kindergarteners,” and hold 8-year-olds responsible for slavery in a fundraising email. <br /><br />In an April 19 speech on the Michigan Senate floor, McMorrow denounced the campaign email from Republican state Sen. Lana Theis that suggested she was a “groomer,” a term that describes how sex offenders make contact with their victims.<br /><br />&quot;I am the biggest threat to your hollow, hateful scheme,” McMorrow said. “Because you can’t claim that you are targeting marginalized kids in the name of ‘parental rights’ if another parent is standing up to say no. So then what? Then you dehumanize and marginalize me. You say that I am one of them.”<br /><br />McMorrow then said she is a straight, white, Christian, married, suburban mom who was taught from a young age that Christianity and faith were about service, community and standing up for others who are marginalized and targeted.<br /><br />She added that learning about slavery, redlining or systemic racism does not mean that children are taught to feel bad about themselves.<br /><br />&quot;No child alive today is responsible for slavery. No one in this room is responsible for slavery,” McMorrow said. “But each and every single one of us bears responsibility for writing the next chapter of history ... We can't pretend that it didn't happen, or deny people their very right to exist.&quot;<br /><br />McMorrow concluded her five-minute speech by saying, “Hate will only win if people like me stand by and let it happen.”<br /><br />“We will not let hate win.”<br /><br />Footage courtesy of the Michigan Senate<br /><br />Stream your PBS favorites with the PBS app: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://to.pbs.org/2Jb8twG">https://to.pbs.org/2Jb8twG</a><br />Find more from PBS NewsHour at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour">https://www.pbs.org/newshour</a><br />Subscribe to our YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2HfsCD6">https://bit.ly/2HfsCD6</a><br /><br />Follow us:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour">http://www.pbs.org/newshour</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/newshour">http://www.twitter.com/newshour</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/newshour">http://www.instagram.com/newshour</a><br /><br />Subscribe:<br />PBS NewsHour podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts</a><br />Newsletters: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/subscribe">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/subscribe</a>{% endraw %}
