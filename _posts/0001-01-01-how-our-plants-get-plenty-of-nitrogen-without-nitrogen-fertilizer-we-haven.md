{% raw %}We haven't used nitrogen fertilizers for years, but our plants get plenty of nitrogen. In today's video, I talk about how this is possible.<br /><br />If you shop on Amazon, you can support OYR simply by clicking this link (bookmark it too) before shopping: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/?tag=oneya-20">http://www.amazon.com/?tag=oneya-20</a><br /><br />Sources:<br />1) Schematic of Nitrogen Cycle: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle#/media/File:Nitrogen_Cycle.svg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle#/media/File:Nitrogen_Cycle.svg</a><br />2) &quot;How Do Plants Get Their Nitrogen From the Air?&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/2014/02/21/how-do-plants-get-their-nitrogen-from-the-air/">http://wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/2014/02/21/how-do-plants-get-their-nitrogen-from-the-air/</a><br />3) &quot;Nitrogen Fixation by Legumes&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_a/A129/">http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_a/A129/</a><br />4) &quot;Azotobacter&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azotobacter">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azotobacter</a><br />5) Garden Professors Blog discussion about nitrogen sharing by legumes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/GardenProfessors/permalink/10153597837656490/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/GardenProfessors/permalink/10153597837656490/</a><br />6) Garden Professors Blog discussion about rhizobia: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/GardenProfessors/permalink/10155245241931490/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/GardenProfessors/permalink/10155245241931490/</a> <br />7) Research Abstract on rhizodeposition study:<br /><br />Fustec, J.; Lesuffleur, F.; Mahieu, S.; Cliquet, J. B.; Agronomy for Sustainable Development, 2010, 30, 1, 57-66.<br />We show that plant roots interact intimately with soil microflora to convert the most abundant but relatively inert form of N, atmospheric N2, into biological substrates available for growth of other plants, through two consecutive processes; namely, N2 fixation and N rhizodeposition. In intercropping, companion plants benefit from biological fixation by legumes and subsequent transfer of N from legumes to non-legumes. This transfer from legumes to the release of N compounds by legume roots, a process named rhizodeposition, then the uptake by the companion crop. The two main rhizodeposition pathways are (i) decomposition and decay of nodules and root cells, and (ii) exudation of soluble N compounds by plant roots. The contribution of root N and rhizodeposited N to the soil-N pool is difficult to measure, particularly in the field. Firstly, root N is often underestimated because root recovery is problematic. Second, assessment of N rhizodeposition is challenging. Several 15N labelling methods have been performed for different legume species. Rhizodeposition of N, as a percentage of total plant N, varied from 4 to 71%. The high variability of the results illustrates the need for more studies of the environmental and genetic factors influencing the amount of N rhizodeposits released by legumes under field conditions.<br /><br />I'm passionate about an approach to organic gardening that is frugal, easy, sustainable, and works with nature to achieve amazing results. My videos will help you grow more healthy organic fruits and vegetables, while working less and saving money. I don't push gardening products. I don't hype bogus &quot;garden secrets&quot;. I provide evidence based strategies to help you grow a lot of food on a little land without spending much or working harder than you have to!{% endraw %}
