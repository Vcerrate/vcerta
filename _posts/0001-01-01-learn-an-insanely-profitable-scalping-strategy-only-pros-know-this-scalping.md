{% raw %}In this video, I will be sharing an amazingly powerful scalping strategy that provides setups daily, along with a high win rate. The strategy can be used for daytrading and scalping stocks, forex, and crypto.<br /><br />When we talk about scalping strategies, most of them are trend following strategies. This is because intraday trends can be very powerful.<br />But the strategy that we will discuss today is a mean reversion strategy.<br /><br />For this strategy, we will mainly use 2 indicators.<br /><br />The first indicator that we will use is the Bollinger bands indicator.<br /><br />The Bollinger bands are a very popular indicator that helps us in identifying market reversals. Bollinger bands consist of three lines. The middle line on the indicator is a simple moving average. By default, the Bollinger bands are set to 20 and 2 settings. This means that the middle line here is a 20-period moving average.<br /><br />An important point to remember here is that we will need some kind of confirmation before we enter a trade.<br />That confirmation will come from looking for divergences in the M-A-C-D indicator. M-A-C-D is a simple indicator that oscillates from the values of +400 to -400. It consists of thee elements, the mac d line, the signal line, and the histogram.<br />For this strategy, we only need the histogram. So we will remove the signal line and the mac d line.{% endraw %}
