{% raw %}We are sure as hell lost without it, and when we say it, we mean the GRAB!<br /><br />In this weeks episode it's a little bit of a stressful one guys. Of course we still make the most of the week because that is the only way to do it, but it was sure as hell a stressful one!<br /><br />We have a nice little fencing install using the normal concrete posts that we make ourselves and instead of the vertilap fence panels we normally use, we have decided to use decking boards to make the fence panels... &amp; boy oh boy they look amazing!<br /><br />BUTTTT, the main part of this weeks video is all about the tarmac driveway install, or extension we are doing for this lovely couple who just happen to be SUBSCRIBERS of the channel! It's going to look amazing when it's all done thats for sure!<br /><br />If you enjoy what you see in this episode don't be shy guys, smash the like button and consider subscring!<br /><br />For all YouTube enquiries please email us on: DJPROJECTSYT@gmail.com<br /><br />We'll see you in the next one, Dave and Stevie!{% endraw %}
