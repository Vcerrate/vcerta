I mostly will play miner poison decks, control decks, and decks with any clash royale new cards that are released. The miner is my favorite clash royale legendary card, and I will typically play clash royale miner control decks the most. The decks I play are great for clash royale 12 win grand challenges, clash royale trophy pushing on ladder, and for clash royale tournaments and clan wars. I hope you guys enjoy my pro tips and tricks and my beginner tips and tricks, and I'll see you in the arena!<br /><br />#ClashRoyale #ElectroGiantDeck #BestElectroGiantDeck #Clash #Royale #ClashRoyal #Miner #MinerPoison #hogrider #hog #deck #bestdeck #best #deck{% endraw %}
