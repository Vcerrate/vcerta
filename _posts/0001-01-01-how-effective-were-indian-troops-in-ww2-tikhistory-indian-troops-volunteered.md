I also want to dispel the myths and distortions that ruin our perception of the past by asking a simple question - ‚ÄúBut is this really the case?‚Äù. I have a 2:1 Degree in History and a passion for early 20th Century conflicts (mainly WW2). I‚Äôm therefore approaching this like I would an academic essay. Lots of sources, quotes, references and so on. Only the truth will do.<br /><br />This video is discussing events or concepts that are academic, educational and historical in nature. This video is for informational purposes and was created so we may better understand the past and learn from the mistakes others have made.{% endraw %}
