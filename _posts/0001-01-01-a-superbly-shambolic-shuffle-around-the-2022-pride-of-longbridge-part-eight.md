And all the incorrect information... Watch at your own risk of boredom and possible loss of sanity.<br /><br />The Slightly Shambolic Shuffles are back! This time we visit the 2022 Pride of Longbridge in Birmingham, and it gets very shambolic very quickly. In this final part, we discover non-existent Minis, a Montego on a trailer, a base model Rover 214, a Morris van badged as an Austin, Mr Bill from Fuel Power filming a Morris Minor, a rare Triumph GT6 and a very nice Rover 800 Coup√© and still really experience very little of any importance at all. Nothing untoward, then!<br /><br />A Preliminary Slightly Shambolic Shuffle Ahead of the 2022 Pride of Longbridge! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rgN8GEZ3DJU">https://youtu.be/rgN8GEZ3DJU</a><br />A Slightly Shambolic Shuffle Around The 2022 Pride of Longbridge: Part One of Eight - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9T1zV96frZI">https://youtu.be/9T1zV96frZI</a><br />A Slightly Shambolic Shuffle Around The 2022 Pride of Longbridge: Part Two of Eight - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9Gu8sm1Mv9Q">https://youtu.be/9Gu8sm1Mv9Q</a><br />A Slightly Shambolic Shuffle Around The 2022 Pride of Longbridge: Part Three of Eight - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/O3Vpz5bQgSQ">https://youtu.be/O3Vpz5bQgSQ</a><br />A Slightly Shambolic Shuffle Around The 2022 Pride of Longbridge: Part Four of Eight - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/QtFdsMJR3JE">https://youtu.be/QtFdsMJR3JE</a><br />A Slightly Shambolic Shuffle Around The 2022 Pride of Longbridge: Part Five of Eight - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mfIZTF3FjNM">https://youtu.be/mfIZTF3FjNM</a><br />A Slightly Shambolic Shuffle Around The 2022 Pride of Longbridge: Part Six of Eight - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/r9jy2o_m7-g">https://youtu.be/r9jy2o_m7-g</a><br />A SUPERBLY Shambolic Shuffle Around The 2022 Pride of Longbridge: Part Seven of Eight - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/yPdYbmxLX1s">https://youtu.be/yPdYbmxLX1s</a><br /><br />As an independent vehicle consultant, I take potential buyers through the whole car buying process from choosing a make and model to a vehicle handover and road tax.
