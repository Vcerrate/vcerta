{% raw %}On the 6th of September, 1992, a group of hunters on the Stampede Trail near Healy in Alaska came across an abandoned city transit bus. Thinking that it might make a convenient shelter for the night, they ventured inside… only to be repelled by a terrible smell that permeated the vehicle’s interior. Suspecting the worst, the hunters radioed local police, who came out and searched the bus. They found the remains of a man who would later be identified as Christopher McCandless – an individual with a fascinating life, and a legacy which has lasted for decades after his death.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:49 - Background<br />04:37 - The Death of Christopher McCandless<br />08:25 - The Aftermath<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery.
