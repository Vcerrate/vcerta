{% raw %}A step that will change the course of the war in Ukraine!<br /><br />USA will supply Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine!<br /><br />As part of a new aid package, the United States will transfer Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine.<br /><br />The bill, approved Thursday by an 86-to-11 vote, provides for $20 billion in universal military assistance that is expected to fund the transfer of advanced weapons systems such as Patriot air defense systems and long-range artillery.<br /><br />The publication notes that the bill also includes more than $8 billion in general economic support for Ukraine, almost $5 billion in global food assistance to address potential food shortages, and more than $1 billion in cumulative support for refugees.<br /><br />Ukraine has repeatedly, since the time before the invasion, asked the United States for the provision of Patriot systems, and after February 24, 2022, this request became one of the main requests along with aircraft and tanks. However, so far he has not been satisfied.<br /><br />A majority of members of the US Senate on Thursday gave final support for about $40 billion in aid to Ukraine.<br /><br />The bill has yet to be signed by President Joe Biden.{% endraw %}
