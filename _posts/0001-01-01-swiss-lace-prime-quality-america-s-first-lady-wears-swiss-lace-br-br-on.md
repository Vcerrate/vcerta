{% raw %}America's First Lady Wears Swiss Lace<br /><br />On inauguration day with millions of people around the world watching, Michelle Obama wowed the world with her intricately patterned lemongrass- colored dress. Reveling in the glory behind the scenes was the textile firm of Forster Rohner AG, located in St. Gallen in northwest Switzerland. Forster Rohner provided the unique fabric known as &quot;etch lace&quot;, which designer Isabel Toledo used to make the dress.<br /><br />The technique that produces etch lace is part of a centuries- long tradition of embroidery and lacework for which Switzerland - and particularly St. Gallen - is famous. Obama's Kenyan grandmother also wore a shawl made from Swiss fabric to the inauguration. Once the world capital for embroidery, St. Gallen had over 100,000 embroidery machines working during the golden age of the 1800s and its fabrics are still featured in haute couture around the world. Visitors can learn more about the rich history of Swiss textiles and fashion at the St. Gallen Textile Museum.{% endraw %}
