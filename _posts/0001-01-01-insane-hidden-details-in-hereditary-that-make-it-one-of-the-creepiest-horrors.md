There are several details within this that hint at certain aspects of the movie and on repeat viewing it fills in more and more of the gaps about the character.<br /><br />Not only was Leigh the grandmother and mother to the family that the film focuses on, we also learn throughout the movie that she was the queen of the cult of Paimon.<br /><br />Paimon is one of eight kings of hell and when researching the figures I learned that his powers include the abilities to creative visions, aquire servants, make spirits appear, reanimate the dead and grant flight which are all things that we see happen in the film.<br /><br />Before the events of the movie we discover that Leigh had attempted to offer up her son Charles as a vessel for his spirit.<br /><br />We learn his name through this opening obituary and it becomes important later as it plays into what is really going on with one of the central characters.<br /><br />Charles committed suicide, accusing Leigh of trying to put people in him and though this was diagnosed as schizophrenia, we know from the events in the movie that this wasn't the case. Because of his death Leigh was unable to give Paimon a vessel. However, that didn't stop her from trying and she waited until her daughter Annie had a son named Peter. At the time they weren't on speaking terms and thus she was unable to use him in a ritual to summon the spirit of the demon.<br /><br />Years later, Annie and Leigh repaired their relationship and Annie had a daughter named Charlie. Charlie was of course named after Charles and from what we know, the cult then set their eyes on her. There's lip service paid to Leigh telling Annie that she wanted a boy and this is exemplified in one of the customised mats that Leigh made for the child which has her name as Charles instead of Charlie.<br /><br />The cult successfully managed to put the spirit of Paimon into the girl, however, Paimon desired a male body and thus he did not bestow upon them the riches that they seeked.<br /><br />The film centres around the cult transferring the spirit of Paimon from Charlie into Peter all whilst carrying out the rituals that enable to possession to occur.<br /><br />Now from the off there's a tonne of foreshadowing, returning characters and just things in general that don't pay off until the end.<br /><br />Annie makes minatures and we initially start off with slow pan across one which then becomes the real world. There are a tonne of theories that exist around the symbolism of this but personally I believe this almost dollhouse like aesthetic shows that the characters don't really have any agency or control over the events that play out.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Vibes&quot;<br />Instrumental by Homage<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/cgTMK54xpL0">https://youtu.be/cgTMK54xpL0</a><br /><br />► Artist Attribution<br />Music By: &quot;KaizanBlu&quot;<br />• Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/">https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/</a><br />• SoundCloud - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/kaizanblu/">https://soundcloud.com/kaizanblu/</a><br />• Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/">https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/</a><br />• TikTok - @kaizanblu <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/">http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/</a><br />• YouTube - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...</a><br />• DOWNLOAD @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu">https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu</a><br />Licence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)<br />- Full licence here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...</a><br />• Music released by: Chill Out Records @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ">https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ</a> &amp; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com">https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com</a>{% endraw %}
