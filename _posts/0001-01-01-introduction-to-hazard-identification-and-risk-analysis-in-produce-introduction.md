{% raw %}Introduction to Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis in Produce<br /><br />1. Describe the difference between hazard and risk<br />2. Better understand how, in the context of the Produce Safety Rule, to identify on farm hazards, assess the degree to which the hazard need control, and the potential risks associated with that hazard<br /><br />Why is it important to understand the difference between hazard analysis and risk assessment? These terms are commonly in food processing since both are part of HACCP. However, both are relatively new terms in produce safety. When these terms are confused and conflated by growers and others in implementing the Produce Safety Rule this may lead to anxiety and ambiguity and a confusion about what risks actually need attention. This webinar increases our understanding of the differences between hazard analysis and risk assessment so growers can make risk-based decisions when developing on-farm food safety implementation plans.<br /><br />This webinar features Don Schaffner, Extension Specialist in Food Science and Distinguished Professor at Rutgers University, who will talk about the differences between hazard analysis and risk assessment, two terms that are often confused or conflated. Michelle Danyluk, Associate Professor in Food Microbiology and Safety at the University of Florida and Don Schaffner explore what hazard and risk mean in the context of the Produce Safety Rule and On-Farm Readiness in an open ended question and answer session.{% endraw %}
