I first start with building a cabinet that will act as a wheel well cover and a storage box for the outdoor storage door of the RV.  Then I move onto building the Media cabinet that houses the hidden chair, desk, and TV inside of it.  Just like in my last video, I still have a few finishing touches to work on with this project and I will be working on those in my next episode.  Hopefully you enjoy this one.
