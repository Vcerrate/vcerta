We delve into why price moves to certain areas of inefficiency, and why you often get stopped out of trades without understanding it. In the next we'll cover more concepts of inefficiency like imbalances, voids, and models.<br /><br />Do you ever wonder why you're constantly losing money in Forex? - Your strategy, your risk management, and your understanding of the market is flawed and its not your fault. <br /><br />At mentfx, we use concepts of structure, snd-order-blocks, mitigation, imbalance, fair value, voids, inefficiency, buy/sell models, wyckoff, and others to determine our direction and potential trades for the next month/week/day/hour/minute/second based on the type of trader you want to become. I do not offer signals or incentivize you to invest under the information in my videos, this is nothing more than perspective. <br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Any money made or lost in the forex market is your responsibility. My concepts and ideas and theories should be demoed on a fake/demo account before being taken to the live markets. If taken to the live markets, any money made or lost is under your OWN discretion and YOUR OWN responsibility. Past performance does not guarantee future results.<br /><br />Thanks. I look forward to having you as a client and talking to you. -Anton<br /><br />#mentfx<br />#mentfunding<br />#SmartMoney<br />#TechnicalAnalysis<br />#Insitutional<br />#OrderFlow<br />#Mentorship<br />#Forex<br />#Stocks<br />#Trading<br />#Crypto<br />#HowToTrade<br />#Wyckoff<br />#getfunded<br />#propfirm<br />#bestpropfirm<br />#1stepevaluation<br />#cheapchallenge<br />#lowspreads{% endraw %}
