{% raw %}You know how it is: some boss's introductory cutscene plays, offering you the chance to size up the enemy and strategise as to how you're going to kick their head in. Every so often though, the boss you think you're going to be stepping to gets stepped on by a much bigger, scarier boss. Watch on to enjoy seven such examples of bosses who were immediately flattened by their more frightening counterparts.
