{% raw %}Eric Kaufmann is Professor of Politics at Birkbeck College, University of London, a CSPI research fellow, and the author of several books, including Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration and the Future of White Majorities. He returns to the podcast to discuss his new report for CPSI, Born This Way? The Rise of LGBT as a Social and Political Identity. He and Richard talk about the factors underlying recent increases in LGBT identification and same-sex sexual behavior, the connection between being very liberal, LGBT, and having mental health issues, and the influence of modernism on left-wing ideology and right-wing political movements. They conclude the conversation by discussing whether concerns about teaching sexuality and CRT in K-12 schools should take precedence over free speech issues on university campuses and debates over history and national identity.<br /><br />Read Eric's new report here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cspicenter.org/reports/born-this-way-the-rise-of-lgbt-as-a-social-and-political-identity/">https://cspicenter.org/reports/born-this-way-the-rise-of-lgbt-as-a-social-and-political-identity/</a><br /><br />Tweet thread: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/epkaufm/status/1531264150231470080">https://twitter.com/epkaufm/status/1531264150231470080</a><br /><br />Subscribe to our YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvs4ugq0xSvbvwArpFJG6gA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvs4ugq0xSvbvwArpFJG6gA?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Sign up for CSPIâ€™s Substack newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cspi.substack.com">https://cspi.substack.com</a> <br /><br />Listen to our Podcast <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://audioboom.com/channels/5041684">https://audioboom.com/channels/5041684</a><br /><br />Follow CSPI on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CSPICenterOrg">https://twitter.com/CSPICenterOrg</a><br /><br />Learn more about CSPI: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cspicenter.org">https://cspicenter.org</a>{% endraw %}
