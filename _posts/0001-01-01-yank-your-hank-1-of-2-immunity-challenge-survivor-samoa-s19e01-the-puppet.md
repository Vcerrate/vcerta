At the end of the course, the six would use the rope to pull a heavy wooden crate across a ramp and up to the finish platform. The four remaining tribe members would disassemble the crate to use as puzzle pieces.

However, Galu pulls ahead and wins immunity.<br /><br />Back at Foa Foa, Mike Borassi thinks the weakest should go, which would be Ashley. However, Russell H. targets Marisa when she says she doesn't trust Russell H. because he's been talking to everyone.  <br /><br />Day 3<br />At Tribal Council, it is down to Marisa and Ashley. Russell H. convinces his allies Ashley, Liz, and Natalie to vote out Marisa, but Betsy sides with Marisa in voting against Ashley. Ben Browning, Jaison, and Mike side with Russell H. as Marisa is the first voted out in a 7-3 vote.<br /><br />Final Words<br />Marisa<br />“Tonight is really difficult for me to swallow. I trusted Russell initially, but it was a mistake to say something to him because he makes trouble and so he made it around me, and I'm really sad to be going home. I don't hold any animosity toward anyone and I'm grateful to have had this experience, however short it might have been.”<br /><br />Trivia<br />The episode title refers to what Russell Hantz referred to himself as.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Yank_Your_Hank">https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Yank_Your_Hank</a><br /><br />Yank Your Hank (also known as Yank Yer Hank) is a recurring challenge in Survivor. First appearing in Survivor: Samoa, it later reappeared in Survivor: Cambodia and Survivor: Edge of Extinction.<br /><br />Rules<br />Members from each tribe would race across a series of wooden A-frames carrying three coils of rope. At the end of the course, a few members would use the rope to pull a heavy wooden crate across a ramp and up to the finish platform. The remaining tribe members would then disassemble the crate and use the puzzle pieces to solve a puzzle. The first tribe to solve their puzzle would win.<br /><br />Beginning in Cambodia, only two tribe members may work on the puzzle at a time, but they may switch out at any point with any member of the tribe<br /><br />History<br />The challenge first appeared as the first Immunity Challenge of the Samoa. Six members of each tribe must race through the obstacle course, after which the last four members would take apart the crate and use the pieces to solve the puzzle. Galu took the early lead after Foa Foa had difficulty on the first A-frame and held onto it throughout the challenge, managing to spell out the phrase, &quot;Without victory there is no survival&quot; first to win immunity, sending Foa Foa to Tribal Council. <br /><br />The challenge later reappeared in Cambodia where all nine members of each tribe would now have to race through the obstacle course. However, the puzzle was changed to a vertical puzzle similar to the one from Buoy Oh Buoy, a challenge from Blood vs. Water. In a close race, Bayon narrowly defeated Ta Keo, sending Ta Keo back to Tribal Council.<br /><br />In Edge of Extinction, the challenge reappeared as the first Immunity Challenge following the Tribe Expansion, with now only two A-frames to climb. The challenge was played in the rain, making climbing the A-frames more difficult for the tribes. In the end, Kama was the first tribe to solve the puzzle, followed by Manu, sending Lesu to Tribal Council.<br /><br />Trivia<br />Joe Anglim, Kelley Wentworth, and Monica Padilla have competed in this challenge twice.<br />Joe and Monica have won both times they competed, whereas Kelley has never won.<br />In all three seasons this challenge occurred, exactly ten castaways won the challenge.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Survivor:_Samoa">https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Survivor:_Samoa</a><br /><br />Survivor: Samoa is the nineteenth season of Survivor. It premiered on September 17, 2009 and concluded on December 20, 2009.<br />In the end, Natalie White defeated Russell Hantz and Mick Trimming in a 7-2-0 vote. Hantz ended up winning the &quot;Sprint Player of the Season&quot; award, earning the fans' vote over Shambo Waters and Brett Clouser. It would ultimately feature two medical evacuations, and has to date produced four returning players (Laura Morett, Monica Padilla, Russell Hantz, and Russell Swan) for subsequent seasons.{% endraw %}
