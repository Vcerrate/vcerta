{% raw %}This 1960 Chevrolet Impala Convertible has a great futuristic look and is ready to cruise! Originally introduced to the public in October 1959, Chevy's 1960 passenger car lineup got an all-around new look. The &quot;cat-eye&quot; taillights from '59 were replaced with the triple style taillights that were carried forward for a number of years. The grilles were updated as well featuring a new oval style look with dual enclosed headlights. On the sides, the new 1960 models also adorned with new trim that was inspired by the look of missiles and the growing aviation industry at the time. Of course, the Impala sat atop of the Chevrolet passenger car model hierarchy with the Impala Convertible being the pinnacle. Moreover, the Impala Convertible was the only convertible in Chevy's '60 lineup that could seat more than 2 passengers, which made it and continues to make it one of the most desirable Chevrolets of the time. Being that the Impala was the top-of-the-line Chevrolet model in 1960, it was notably dressed up from nose to tail with additional trim around the exterior making sure that everyone around the car knew that it was top-notch. This particular '60 Impala Convertible comes to us from a southern-based collector who enjoyed this car for a number of years. Powering this Impala is a 348 V8 engine with a Tri-Power carburetor setup (3 dual-barrel carburetors). The 348 V8 is hooked up to a Powerglide Automatic Transmission. With power steering, getting and out of those tight parking spaces is made much easier. Air conditioning has been added to this Impala Convertible as well so that you can stay cool even on the hottest summer days. The White Vinyl Power Convertible Top goes up and down with ease, operated by a knob under the dash. The exterior has been refinished in a beautiful Roman Red color which has to be one of the favorite exterior colors among Impalas. Riding on wide whitewall tires with full wheelcovers, this '60 Impala has a great appearance and even better ride. Additionally, the rear wheels are tucked behind a pair of fender skirts which complete the exterior look of this Convertible. The interior on this Impala Convertible is fantastic! The front and rear bench seat have been reupholstered in Red and White vinyl with matching Red and White Houndstooth cloth inserts. The dash, door panels, and steering wheel all appear to be in their stock configuration and have a great look! The dash is equipped with a 120 MPH Speedometer, temperature gauge, fuel gauge, generator and oil pressure indicator lights, clock and AM radio. Whether you're looking to buy your very first classic car or your garage is full of early generation Impalas, this 1960 Chevrolet Impala would make and excellent choice.
