{% raw %}🍛 Pakistani Street Food in Dubai: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2Iiy1uaTYWk">https://youtu.be/2Iiy1uaTYWk</a><br />🔔 SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe">http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe</a> Don’t miss new food videos!<br /><br />DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - Welcome to Dubai, and tonight we’re going to eat at Amaseena (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/dubai/dubai-beach/dining/amaseena)">https://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/dubai/dubai-beach/dining/amaseena)</a> which is a wonderful Middle Eastern food buffet in Dubai! Among the many dishes they make, one of their secret specialties is a 1 meter kofta kebab that Chef Tawfeek makes himself!<br /><br />First, we took a full tour of the buffet with Chef Tawfeek. Originally from Syria, he’s been living in Dubai and cooking his home and family recipes as well as a host of dishes from the Middle East. The mezze cold salads section was impressive with an array of hummus and baba ganoush, and a full array of delicious vegetables and dips.<br /><br />The hot section was equally as impressive with a rotating menu of different dishes from Moroccan lamb neck to Lebanese fish in tahini. And then you have the full grill station which covers Middle Eastern and Mediterranean bbq - the lamb chops were insanely tasty, but the tastiest of them all was the 1 meter long spicy kofta kebab - a specialty of Syria and Lebanon. What I love so much about kofta kebab is that it’s not just the meat, but it includes so much extra spices and ingredients like pine nuts, parsley and allspice.<br /><br />We had an amazing Middle Eastern food buffet experience at Amaseena Buffet in Dubai at the Ritz Carlton Hotel.<br /><br />📍 Amaseena Buffet (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://g.page/Amaseena?share),">https://g.page/Amaseena?share),</a> Address: 26 Al Mamsha St - Jumeirah Beach Residence - Dubai - United Arab Emirates<br /><br /> 🎵MUSIC: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/HwVjdo">https://goo.gl/HwVjdo</a><br /><br />——————————————————<br /><br />🍌100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z">http://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z</a><br /><br />👕Get t-shirts and caps:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://migrationology.com/store/">https://migrationology.com/store/</a><br /><br />——————————————————<br /><br />📱FOLLOW:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/migrationology">https://instagram.com/migrationology</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/migrationology">https://www.facebook.com/migrationology</a>{% endraw %}
