{% raw %}I flew on Kenya Airways B787 Dreamliner from Nairobi to Dubai. This video share with you my experience of flying Kenya Airways.<br /><br />I visited both The Simba and The Pride Lounge of Kenya Airways in Nairobi Airport. The Pride Lounge is much bigger with more comfort in my opinion. The boarding process was not smooth, my flight was delayed due to the late and slow boarding process. <br /><br />Once onboard, the Kenya Airways crew were friendly and attentive. The Business Class is arranged in 2-2-2 configuration. The seat can go 180 degrees fully flat but with little privacy. After takeoff, a simple and underwhelming dinner is served. <br /><br />At the end of the flight, I gave my verdict on flying Kenya Airways.{% endraw %}
