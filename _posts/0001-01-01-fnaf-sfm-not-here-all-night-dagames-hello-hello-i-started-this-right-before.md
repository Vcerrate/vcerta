{% raw %}Hello hello! I started this right before the release of Robot Hell and I'm happy to finally release it to you all! This wasn't expected to be anything more than a short but my peers insisted I continue to complete the video. You can see how my skills in environments and lighting improve over time in the video, and while I'm insecure of how evident it is, in proud altogether of the video I've made over the past eight months!<br /><br />You may also catch a few nods and memorabilia to some of my personal favorite animations and projects by other animators in the past year or two. I hope this video lives up to your expectations ðŸ’–<br /><br />-Sprin<br /><br />-------------------------------------<br /><br />Also, this project was completely non-profit! If you're feeling generous, consider pledging to my Patreon! As we speak I'm uploading this video to YouTube from my cell phone - anything helps to make these videos more conveniently possible to you all ðŸ’ž<br /><br />-------------------------------------<br /><br />Not Here All Night - DAGames<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9HVXHi66T_U">https://youtu.be/9HVXHi66T_U</a><br /><br />------<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/jer_studiosprin">https://twitter.com/jer_studiosprin</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/spriin">https://patreon.com/spriin</a>{% endraw %}
