{% raw %}I feel very blessed and also very sad this week... Very blessed indeed to have such a beautiful art studio, just for me, and, very sad to have been cyber-attacked on Instagram. See below for the update on that. <br /><br />Hello Beauties, let's have a moving vlog, shall we? About a year ago I moved into a very sweet art studio which was always meant as an interim room for me. After lots of ups and downs and behind-the-scenes happenings, (thank you to Patrons for listening to this bumpy journey!) I finally got the keys and was able to move into my new, dream art studio! Thanks, as always for keeping me company on this wild journey called life. Biggest loves &amp; softest hugs, Wendy. Xxx<br /><br />To support me you can like, comment and subscribe to my channel or, - <br />for exclusive behind the scenes content, art journaling &amp; painting videos, secret vlogs, Q&amp;A's, podcasts, Livestreams, Happy Mail etc. you can check out our inspiring Patreon community here -<br />Patreon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/theunexpectedgypsy">https://www.patreon.com/theunexpectedgypsy</a><br /><br />A note re My Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/the.unexpected.gypsy">https://www.instagram.com/the.unexpected.gypsy</a><br />I'm sad to say my Instagram is currently deactivated due to someone cloning my account. The imposter has been messaging, trying to call, hassling and even swearing  'F' words and abuse at my followers and so if that was directed at you, I apologise so much for this. Everything has been reported and fingers crossed they will reinstate my account soon. I also wish to thank anyone who did report this on my behalf, much appreciated. Xxx <br />Watch this space! Xxx<br />***Find me on Facebook in the meantime - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/theunexpectedgypsy">https://www.facebook.com/theunexpectedgypsy</a><br />I don't usually promo my Facebook as I really prefer the functions on Instagram but I do post to Facebook almost as regularly as Insta as the accounts are both linked. P.s. Thanks for all the support on the 'Insta Thing!' I reported an imposter account today and found a way to write a full report to Instagram... fingers crossed for me!
