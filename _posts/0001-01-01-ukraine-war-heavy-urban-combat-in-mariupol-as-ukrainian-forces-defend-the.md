{% raw %}Cellphone footage recorded from the home of a resident shows heavy urban combat taking place between Ukrainian and Russian/&quot;Novorussian&quot; forces in the battle for control over the city of Mariupol.<br /><br />The got so intense at some point of the video that the witness who recorded the footage had to keep his head down and take cover himself as an presumably anti-tank weapon was launched towards a advancing conovy on the streets.<br /><br />While the quality of the footage is not detailed enough to determine which vehicle convoy got engaged it can be said that it was most likely Russian since they are the ones who currently assaulting the city.<br /><br />Mariupol is a heavy contested area since 2014 when Russian backed seperatists already tried to capture the city for the first time but got kicked out by Ukrainian forces who hold the city till now.<br /><br />Currently we could not collect any valid reports of hold, gained or lost ground of either of the combating sides.<br /><br />WarLeaks - Military Blog covers events, news, missions &amp; facts from the United States Armed Forces including the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy,  U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard and more!
