{% raw %}A lot of us are mesmerized by the aesthetic beauty of the natural world and God’s uncultivated, original text. I have a passion for landscape paintings and art history, especially that of the Hudson River School artists, who created a movement that glorified nature. In  “The Course of Empire”, Thomas Cole foresees the downfall of civilization and destruction of the planet as urbanization grows, but is conscious that, like the phoenix, the Earth will heal itself, recover, and the sun will rise again, leaving no trace of mankind behind when we’re gone. In this video I briefly explain transitions from classicism to romanticism and view the finer details of &quot;The Course of Empire&quot;.<br /><br />I feel that there is no better time to smile and have faith than now. I made this educational video (which I highly recommend you watch on a large screen in 1080p) to entertain, inform, and bring appreciation and hope for the world{% endraw %}
