{% raw %}Looking back at the Timex Data Link Model 70, an early smartwatch introduced by Microsoft in 1994 for Windows 3.1 PCs! It stores up to 70 data entries viewable on its LCD screen, but its real party trick is how it wirelessly synchronizes with a CRT monitor. Just point your wrist at the screen and data transfer begins, it's awesome. And it's NASA approved for space travel, too!<br /><br />● LGR links:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/LazyGameReviews">https://www.patreon.com/LazyGameReviews</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/LazyGameReviews">https://www.twitter.com/LazyGameReviews</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/LazyGameReviews">https://www.facebook.com/LazyGameReviews</a><br /><br />● Archives of the DataLink floppy disks can be found here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://archive.org/details/timex-datalink-disks">https://archive.org/details/timex-datalink-disks</a><br /><br />● All background music licensed from:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.epidemicsound.com">http://www.epidemicsound.com</a><br /><br />#LGR #Oddware #Watches{% endraw %}
