{% raw %}The January 6th Committee is currently receiving more information than they know how to even process, and that's according to their own admission. They are struggling to not only comb through everything, but also on how to present it in a way that is comprehensible to the American public. This is why a special prosecutor should have been appointed months ago, as Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins has been talking about for a very long. <br /><br />Link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/31/january-6-committee-hot-streak-trump-world-00003368">https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/31/january-6-committee-hot-streak-trump-world-00003368</a><br /><br />Become a member today!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join</a><br /><br />Support us by becoming a monthly patron on Patreon, and help keep progressive media alive!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire">https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire</a><br /><br />Find our merchandise at Teespring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store">https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store</a><br /><br />Spread the word!

And here's why. They're in over their heads because they've been very successful and, and I do not mean in any way to demean the work of this committee. I think what they're doing is vital. I think they've kind of turned a corner here and they've really become super focused on all of these different avenues, but that's where they're running into trouble right now and the members are admitting this. They're saying, listen, we, we've won these court cases. We now have all of these documents flowing into us. We don't have time, they're telling us. We don't have the manpower.<br /><br />And probably worst of all, we don't know if we even have the ability to distill all of this down into something that makes sense to the American public by Summer. Remember because they put that self-imposed deadline on themselves that, oh, we're gonna have this report out by Summer. And now they've got all these documents. They've got all of these different avenues they're chasing, you know, the stop the steal rally, the coup, the riot, the police, the FBI, all of these, the, the, the states turning in their forged election documents. New avenues are opening up constantly. New documents are coming in all the time. And again, that's a testament to how successful the committee has been. But now they're telling us this might be too much for us. And again, I'm typically not one to sit here and boast about ha ha told you so, but this is literally exactly what I have been saying is going to happen to them for months now, for months, I've been sitting here telling you they're in over their heads.<br /><br />I've literally done a segment that was titled the January 6th committee is in over their heads. And now they're finally starting to understand that themselves. So what needs to happen? You know what needs to happen if you watch this channel regularly, it's time for special prosecutors. Yes, multiple. On each different avenue that this committee is looking at, there should be a separate special prosecutor. The investigation does need to be broken up. It is too broad in depth and scope for one Individual to look at every single thing. So you put a special prosecutor on the stop the steal rally part. You put a special prosecutor on the coup documents. You put a special prosecutor on the effort of these states to, you know, submit the forged documents. That's what has to happen at this point. Not just to give the committee a break, not just to make sure their work doesn't die when Republicans take over after the midterms, but because that might be the only way to get real succinct answers for the American public, without that self-imposed Summer deadline.{% endraw %}
