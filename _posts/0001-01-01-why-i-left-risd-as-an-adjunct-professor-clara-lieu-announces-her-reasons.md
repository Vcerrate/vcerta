{% raw %}Clara Lieu announces her reasons for leaving her position as an Adjunct Professor at the Rhode Island School of Design, after teaching there for 14 years. Institutional racism, unsustainable working conditions including lack of job security, benefits such as life insurance and more contribute to a systematic problem in high education which was been ongoing for many years. Prof Lieu explains her experiences at RISD as an adjunct professor and why despite world class resources and facilities, phenomenal students and more, weren't enough for her to stay in an environment that was hostile and toxic for POC. <br /><br />PURCHASE A PORTFOLIO CRITIQUE OR ARTIST CALL<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artprof.org/purchase-a-portfolio-critique/">https://artprof.org/purchase-a-portfolio-critique/</a> <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ClaraLieu?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/ClaraLieu?sub_confirmation=1</a> <br /><br />RELATED VIDEOS<br />How Art Schools Fail at Career Prep: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/o8VZf9uVwFM">https://youtu.be/o8VZf9uVwFM</a> <br />Racism at Art School: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/_cORmIvsHMA">https://youtu.be/_cORmIvsHMA</a> <br />Art School Tea: Adjunct Faculty: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/b4M85O_mqf8">https://youtu.be/b4M85O_mqf8</a> <br /><br />❤️SUPPORT ART PROF<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/artprof">https://www.patreon.com/artprof</a> <br /><br />❤️MAKE A ONE TIME DONATION<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/artprof">https://www.paypal.me/artprof</a><br /><br />✅ GET ART PROF MERCH!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/art-prof">https://teespring.com/stores/art-prof</a><br /><br />✅ PURCHASE ART MADE DURING OUR LIVE STREAMS<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/ArtProfProjects">https://www.etsy.com/shop/ArtProfProjects</a><br /><br />JOIN THE ART PROF DISCORD SERVER<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/2Ena4aR5Dh">https://discord.gg/2Ena4aR5Dh</a><br /><br />CONNECT WITH US<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/art.prof/">https://www.instagram.com/art.prof/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/artproffamily/">https://www.instagram.com/artproffamily/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/claralieu">https://twitter.com/claralieu</a> <br /><br />ART PROF PODCAST<br />Available on Spotify &amp; iTunes!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/69k5OT267xpXodcCh810fa">https://open.spotify.com/show/69k5OT267xpXodcCh810fa</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/art-prof/id1523194260">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/art-prof/id1523194260</a><br /><br />ART PROF STAFF PLAYLISTS ON SPOTIFY<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/gco4r8v6899ekhsek6mllywd1">https://open.spotify.com/user/gco4r8v6899ekhsek6mllywd1</a><br /><br />Clara Lieu was an Adjunct Professor at the Rhode Island School of Design from 2007-2020.
