{% raw %}This video is of Jeremy Clarkson author of What Could Possibly Go Wrong? where he discusses if he would choose May or Hammond in regards to various topics. Hilarious? Absolutely as you would expect.<br /><br />Here is the book description for his latest book What Could Possibly Go Wrong?<br /><br />No one writes about cars like Jeremy Clarkson. While most correspondents are too busy diving straight into BHP, MPG and MPH, Jeremy appreciates that there are more important things to life.  Don't worry, we'll get to the cars. Eventually. But first we should consider:<br /><br />The case for invading France<br />The overwhelming appeal of a nice sit-down<br />The inconvenience of gin and tonic<br />Why clothes are no better than ice cream<br />Spot-welding with the Duchess of Kent<br />And why Denmark is the best place in the world<br />Armed only with conviction, curiosity, enthusiasm and a pair of stout trousers, Jeremy hurtles around the world - along motorway, autoroute, freeway and autobahn - in search of answers to life's puzzles and ponderings without forethought or fear for his own safety. <br /><br />What, you have to ask, could possibly go wrong . . .<br /><br />Find out more about this book and while you are at it, read a sample chapter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.penguin.com.au/products/9780718180225/what-could-possibly-go-wrong">http://www.penguin.com.au/products/9780718180225/what-could-possibly-go-wrong</a>{% endraw %}
