{% raw %}Breathe a deep breath of soothing relaxation and ease your mind all day to the sound of calming ocean waves 🌊😌✨💙<br /><br />Today's dose of free meditation comes to us from the island paradise of San Blas. This archipelago is located just off of the Caribbean coast in Panama. The area is home to 365 pristine islands. So natural and pure, they are the place for total relaxation.<br /><br />Let's soak up the zen, Panama-style!...<br /><br />Gaze at the lapping blue waters...<br />So crystal clear and pure...<br />There's no sea more azure!<br />Listen to their sound...<br />So soothing and clean...<br />Each wave in is a dream...<br />Miles away from hustle and bustle...<br />This truly is the place to unwind...<br />Float on...<br />And soak up the calm 🥰🥰🥰<br /><br />Did you know that spending time by the beach is good for our mental health?<br /><br />The ocean has meditative properties. It works to reduce stress and reduce anxiety. Even just looking at the ocean and hearing its water sounds helps improve our moods and relieve any anxiety.
