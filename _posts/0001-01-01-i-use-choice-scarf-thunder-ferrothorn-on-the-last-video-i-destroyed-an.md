{% raw %}▶ On the last video, I destroyed an entire stall team in OU with Work Up Sheer Force Tauros.

Hope you enjoy Choice Scarf Thunder Ferrothorn in the Pokemon Showdown Sword and Shield OU tier! :)<br /><br />Team Importable: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pokepast.es/69363885128df45f">https://pokepast.es/69363885128df45f</a><br /><br />Sometimes when I am sick I am unable to think straight, and this might be one of those times. However, Choice Scarf Ferrothorn has been quite a successful set overall despite being very difficult to KO a single Pelipper. Initially I wanted to make a video just on the replay I had on the ladder of Thunder ripping apart an entire Pelipper, but had the energy to record a full length video using this set. I wouldn't say it's a good set by any means, but I found it quite fun. I paired Thunder Ferrothorn with Tyranitar for Stealth Rocks and to immediately checkmate Rain once Pelipper was disposed of. I also have Landorus-T for Defog and Rocky Helmet Buzzwole to deal with Kartana, Rillaboom, Urshifu-Rapid-Strike, etc. Volcanion allows me to shred Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and other Pokemon to give an easier time to Ferrothorn. Finally, Choice Scarf Gengar gives me a good revenge killer and has the speed to outrun many other Choice Scarf users like Kartana, Tapu Lele, etc. I think from this video I have learned that this Ferrothorn set is not one of those lead and destroy Pelipper turn 1, but rather bring Ferrothorn in a few turns later when Pelipper is in and they will most likely stay in and perish :)<br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/3MV33">http://bit.ly/3MV33</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/kcwncgWeRf">https://discord.gg/kcwncgWeRf</a><br />Music: 'Kairi' (Remix) from KH<br /><br />00:00 Introduction and Team Breakdown<br />02:59 Just The Match-up Ferrothorn Was Looking For<br />05:21 Choice Scarf Ferrothorn Puts In AMAZING Work<br />11:15 Another Pelipper Is Scared Of Our Ferrothorn...<br />12:37 This Was Actually A Really Solid Game Overall<br />20:13 The Opponent Has An Annoyingly Bulky Team<br />30:28 Ferrothorn Outruns Choice Specs Magnezone!<br />34:18 THIS GAME IS THE REASON I MADE THIS VID<br /><br />Want to take your game to the next level?
