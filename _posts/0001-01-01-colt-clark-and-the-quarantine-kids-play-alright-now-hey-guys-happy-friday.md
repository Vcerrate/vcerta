We're the Clark family.  Colt (the dad) is a professional musician and Aubree (me, the mom behind the camera) is a photographer.  Together we home school our three children (even when we're not in the middle of a pandemic). :) To keep busy during the shutdown we started learning and recording a new song every other day to share with our friends and family. We love playing music and spending time together as a family.  Hopefully these songs brighten your day!{% endraw %}
