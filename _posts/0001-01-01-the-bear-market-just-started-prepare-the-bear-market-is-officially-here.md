Rainbow Blvd # 270<br />Las Vegas, NV 89103<br /><br />WHY IS THE MARKET FALLING?<br />Two main reasons. Reason number 1: Jerome Powell just announced this week that he is committed to increasing our interest rates at half a percent for the rest of the year which is the fastest pace since 1994.<br /><br />Reason number 2: a few stocks dragged the entire market down which usually doesn’t happen but it did this time - and that stock was Target - here’s why it did that. Investors thought Target was going to earn $3.07 per share - this is called the EPS which was roughly a 20% drop. But as soon as they released earnings - we found it it was a lot worse because their actual EPS was $2.19 which was a 41% drop - twice as bad as we thought. To make matters worse - the day before - Walmart came out with their numbers and it was also pretty bad. <br /><br />WHO CARES ABOUT TARGET AND WALMART?<br />Because Walmart and Target is the shopping home of America so if those two retail giants are struggling - we are in trouble because that means everyone is else is also going to struggle as well.<br /><br /> Both Target and Walmart blamed inflation for their decreased profit margins - they cited higher fuel costs, higher costs from their suppliers, and higher costs for labor.<br /><br />ARE WE GOING INTO A RECESSION?<br />It's not guaranteed but investors are worried these retail giants could represent a larger problem. Since our first quarter GDP was already negative. If we follow that up with another one quarter of negative GDP - then it’s official. <br /><br />WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE STOCK MARKET?<br />Here’s a really interesting analysis from Canaccord Genuity (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3NocCgw)">https://bit.ly/3NocCgw)</a> of the past 12 bear markets that we’ve had since World War II - the majority of them - 9 out of 12 have went down at least 25% from their all time highs. Three of those bear markets were really bad which was in 1973, the year 2000, and 2007 when the market fell more than 40%.<br /><br />The average decline from the top to the bottom or “peak to trough” as the official terminology is - was actually 38%. But if we exclude the big drops of 40%+ from 1973, 2000, and 2007 - the actual average decline was 31% so that’s what we can expect and that’s why so many analysts are preparing for a drop of something like 30% but so far we’re down 18% which means we have potentially another 13 % drop to go so expect a little more pain ahead if history repeats itself.<br /><br />BE CAREFUL OF &quot;RELIEF RALLIES&quot;<br />These tend to happen after the market loses 20% from its peak and on average have lasted roughly 2 months. They get investors excited because people think maybe the market is coming back up - but then the stock market starts to fall again and if that’s the case - this will last until the start of the second quarter earnings season. <br /><br />HAS THE MARKET REACHED THE BOTTOM YET?<br />There's a way to figure out when we're close - watch the video to find out!<br /><br />SOURCES:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.investors.com/news/retail-stocks-target-walmart-earnings/">https://www.investors.com/news/retail-stocks-target-walmart-earnings/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/sp500-bear-market-last-history-51652913257?refsec=markets&amp;mod=topics_markets">https://www.barrons.com/articles/sp500-bear-market-last-history-51652913257?refsec=markets&amp;mod=topics_markets</a> <br /> <br />*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.
