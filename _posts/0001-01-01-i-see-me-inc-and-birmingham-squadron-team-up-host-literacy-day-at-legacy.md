{% raw %}Promoting literacy and using it to dismantle a school-to-prison pipeline is the initiative for Devon Frazier.  She’s the brains behind “I See Me, Inc,&quot; an organization working primarily with children of color and making sure their reading skills are up to par. Now the organization has help in its push.  <br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;I See Me, INC&quot; and the Birmingham Squadron have teamed up to encourage children to read and it’s started with a new competition. More than a dozen local elementary schools have joined the “Battle of the Books”  challenge to see which school can read the most books by February 25th. The Birmingham Squadron host Literacy Day at Legacy Arena on March 7th. The first 2000 students to show up at the game, will get a free Squadron school kit.<br /><br />Subscribe to WVTM on YouTube now for more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2jvAaUD">https://bit.ly/2jvAaUD</a><br /><br />Get more Birmingham news: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.wvtm13.com">http://www.wvtm13.com</a><br />Like us:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/WVTM13/">https://www.facebook.com/WVTM13/</a><br />Follow us: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/WVTM13">https://twitter.com/WVTM13</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/wvtm13/">https://www.instagram.com/wvtm13/</a>{% endraw %}
