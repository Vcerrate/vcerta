{% raw %}According to Ian Andrew, Cherry Hill has the best greens in Canada. Bold? We think so. Credible? We think so. <br /><br />Join us for Part 1 of Walter Weekend, where we explore the first of two of Walter Travis' layouts in the Niagara region. Located in Ridgeway, ON, near the shores of Lake Erie, Cherry Hill oozes class. It's a club that feels American, despite its use of a postal code. Historically, a membership dominated by US citizens, the club has seen a rise in Canadian contingent with recent border closures, a welcome trend. <br /><br />It's a club that places all the emphasis on golf, celebrates tournament play (host of the 1972 Canadian Open, among others), and posts daily stimp speeds on the starter's hut. Since the early 2000's, Ian Andrew has been collaborating with John Gall (former superintendent) &amp; Jeremy Krueger (current super) on bunkering and green site contouring and runoffs to create varied interest. So much interest, in fact, that Dave Bunker (Ontario Golf Hall of Fame) and wife Lisa's search for a retirement plan concluded after playing four holes at Cherry Hill. <br /><br />We hope you enjoy the golf course as much as the TPL crew. We're long on Cherry Hill, come see why.{% endraw %}
