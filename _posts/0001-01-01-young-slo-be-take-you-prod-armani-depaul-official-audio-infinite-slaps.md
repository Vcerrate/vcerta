Nightmare On Seventh Street is the 8 track album that arrives just in time for Halloween. The difference is that Slo-Be didn't have to go to the movies to see horror. He let's us know just how terrifying life on his block can become throughout the new EP. Check out the new release up top and on all platforms!<br /><br />#InfiniteSlaps{% endraw %}
