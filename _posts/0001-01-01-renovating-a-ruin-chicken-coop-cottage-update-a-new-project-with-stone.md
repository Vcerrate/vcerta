{% raw %}Welcome back to another episode of Renovating a Ruin. This week I'm giving you an update on the chicken coop construction and starting a whole new area of the farm as we clear the stone pigsties with the most beautiful view. I hope you enjoy it.<br />If you would like to support my work, you can find my Patreon page here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/KylieFlavell">https://www.patreon.com/KylieFlavell</a><br />You can find my recipes and other information on moving to Italy, learning Italian or my filmmaking equipment on my website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kylieflavell.com/">https://www.kylieflavell.com/</a><br />Please don't follow me on Facebook as that person is not me - they have stolen my identity for the past few years.
