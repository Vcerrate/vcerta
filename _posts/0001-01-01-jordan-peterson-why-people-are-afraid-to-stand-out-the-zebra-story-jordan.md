{% raw %}Jordan Peterson uses the zebra story to explain fundamental human motivation. Zebras are not camouflaged against the background but rather camouflaged against the herd. If you mark the zebra so you can track it, the marked zebra is quickly killed by the lions, because lions have to identify a zebra before they can organize their hunt. People act according to the same principles and camouflage themselves against the &quot;herd&quot;. People keep their stripes on so the &quot;lions&quot; don't get them. You might think that people are aiming at success, but that is not by any means necessarily true. The negative emotion system is a killer source of motivation. People aren't after happiness, they're after not hurting. They want to avoid suffering. Therefore, they try to move into the middle of the &quot;herd&quot;, so that there is a protective ring of people around them that can protect them from &quot;lions&quot;. You might be successful if you stand out from the &quot;herd&quot;, but you also might be &quot;dead&quot;. Because there is a real danger in being visible, people are afraid to stand out. So the fundamental human motivation according to Jordan Peterson is to be invisible and left alone.<br /><br />This audio clip was taken and edited from the following video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7GKmznaqsQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7GKmznaqsQ</a><br /><br />Â©The Wisdom Wire{% endraw %}
