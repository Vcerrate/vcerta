{% raw %}WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE DISNEY HOTEL ROOM TOUR<br />Accessible room tour at Disney Paris’ New Port Bay Hotel. <br />.<br />We absolutely loved staying at New Port Bay. The theaming was fun, the hotel was clean, and the staff were really friendly and helpful. I found the accessibility to be really good thought the hotel, except the ONE TINY LIFT out to the lake, and onto the parks &amp; village. <br />.<br />I found the accessible room to be really good too, and what I would expect from a Disney hotel. We did feel the hotel &amp; room was a little tired, and was in need of a little refresh.  But overall we would stay here again.<br />.<br />Have you stayed here? How did you find the hotel? Whats your favourite Disney hotel? <br />.<br />Do you have any questions about the hotel? I shall be filming a longer tour video for my youtube channel soon. <br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />#DisneyLandParis #Accessible #WheelchairAccessible #WheelchairAccessibleHotel #WheelchairTravel <br />I really hope this video was worth the wait.
