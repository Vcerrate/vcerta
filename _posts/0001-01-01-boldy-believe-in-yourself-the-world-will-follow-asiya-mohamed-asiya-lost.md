{% raw %}Asiya lost both her legs and three fingers in a freak train accident at 2 years. Her father died the same day from a shock induced stroke. By the age of 8, she was a disabled orphan. Sounds bleak, right? Asiya Mohamed doesn't waste time feeling sorry for herself. She is the master of saying Yes to opportunities as she knows that they don't come along all the time.  She is a multiple gold medal wheelchair marathon winner, member of the Kenya wheelchair tennis team and the 1st Kenyan to qualify for the Olympics and Paralympics in rowing. <br />Her secret to success? Self-Belief &amp; Self- Love. <br />#Tokyo #Tennis #Wheelchair #Marathons #Selflove #Believe #Love <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD-Mf4F5ZQ1Jw-?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD-Mf4F5ZQ1Jw-?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Engage provides a platform for ordinary and extraordinary people to Inform.
