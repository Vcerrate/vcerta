{% raw %}#bracelet #handmade #easymethod <br /><br />In this tutorial I show you how to tie a snake knot. The knot has many uses in rope crafts, from making bracelets, lanyards, to even making dog leashes and zipper pulls.<br /><br />It is a very common knot in the paracord crafts, so I highly recommend learning it.{% endraw %}
