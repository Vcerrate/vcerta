CALLING THE COPS ONLY PUTS CITIZENS IN DANGER OF VIOLENCE AND THREAT OF ARREST. IF YOU WANT TO BE THE PERSON THAT PUTS PEOPLE IN JAIL BY VIOLATING THEIR RIGHTS THEN YOU DESERVE THE SAME OR EVEN A BANE ACT VIOLATION. <br />The Bane Act (California Civil Code ยง 52.1.), also known as the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act, is a civil code in California Law that forbids people from interfering with your constitutional rights by force or threat of violence.[1][2] A lawsuit under the Bane Act is a civil claim against someone who has attempted or managed to interfere with your civil rights (as guaranteed by state and federal law in the United States) through any act or acts of coercion, violence, threats of violence, or intimidation, including victims of hate crime violence. The rights protected under the Bane Act are inclusive of the right to vote, speak, bear arms, etc.[3] One example of such a lawsuit followed the death of actress Vanessa Marquez, whose mother's attorneys filed a claim against the City of South Pasadena, California for violation of the Bane Act.[4]<br />DONT BELIEVE ME THEN LOOK IT UP<br />Add me on FACEBOOK <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100048227620229">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100048227620229</a><br />Equipment list:<br />Sony a6400 camera <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sony.com/search?query=a6400&amp;locale=en_US">https://www.sony.com/search?query=a6400&amp;locale=en_US</a><br /><br />Sony lens <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/camera-lenses/sel18200le">https://www.sony.com/electronics/camera-lenses/sel18200le</a><br /><br />Gopro max <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/max/CHDHZ-201-master.html">https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/max/CHDHZ-201-master.html</a><br /><br />Gopro chest strap <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/mounts-accessories/chesty/AGCHM-001.html">https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/mounts-accessories/chesty/AGCHM-001.html</a><br /><br />Sirui monopod <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1314371-REG/sirui_sup204sr_aluminum_photo_video_monopod.html">https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1314371-REG/sirui_sup204sr_aluminum_photo_video_monopod.html</a><br />#1stamendment #auditEVERYONE #FILMJOURNEY<br />#SLOCOUNTYOBSERVER <br />1st amendmentaudit #sanJoaquinvalleytransparency #downeytransparenteye #amagansettpress #kerncountytransparency #highdesertcommunitywatch <br />#1ontrendingyoutube #1stonscene #sgvnewsfirst<br />all, thanks for watching my content.
