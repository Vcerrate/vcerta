However, we made it so every 5 minutes, the game become more realistic. When we start, we have the most basic level of minecraft, and slowly as time goes by, it becomes more realistic until it looks the same as real life! Do we manage to win and beat this Minecraft challenge before our computers can't handle the realism? This Minecraft challenge was really funny and hilarious!<br /><br />If this video gets 15,000 likes, I'll CHAGPOMP!<br /><br />Edited by SethBoyerD<br /><br />Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or Surviving 100 Days In Minecraft, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin<br /><br />#Minecraft #MinecraftChallenge #MinecraftBut{% endraw %}
