{% raw %}what my fit mom eats in a day (actually realistic... yolanda hadid could never). Check out <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://matcha.com">https://matcha.com</a> &amp; use my code JAZMIN for 20% off your first order!<br /><br />HI and welcome to today's what I eat in a day vlog... except I'm showing what my mom eats!! she's never really had a strict diet and the way she raised us focused on wholesome, nutritious &amp; healthy foods while not actually restricting anything, allowing us to truly enjoy our lives and food! she never pressured me to be &quot;skinny&quot; or lose weight: it was all about feeling our best. seeing all these videos of yolanda hadid telling gigi not to eat makes me so sad, and I never want this cycle of moms pressuring their daughters to diet to continue :(<br /><br />as always we've got tons of easy &amp; healthy recipes in this vlog (in Cabo!!) including chocolate brownie avocado cookies (sounds gross, tastes amazing) plus some simple lunch and dinner ides (I elevated chicken &amp; veggies by showing you how to make a crunchy Thai peanut salad, as well as some delicious flaky salmon) so I hope you enjoyyyy! I also showed my fit mom's workouts for some fitness inspiration lol she's amazing!<br /><br />follow me on IG for daily recipes @JazTyler<br />get my healthy recipe ebooks at JazTyler.com<br /><br />Check out my channel for what I eat in a week, relaxing cooking vlogs, chill week in the life videos, healthy recipes, UC Berkeley, vlogs, morning routines, vegan meals, plant based recipes, living alone diaries, and celebrity and influencer what I eat in a days (Emma Chamberlain, urmomashley, Nicole Laeno, Linda Sun, Sanne Vloet, Victoria Secret Models, Abbey Sharp, Zendaya, Hitomi Mochizuki, Michelle Choi, Bella Hadid, Leahs Fieldnotes, Alia Zaita, Moya Mawhinney and more)<br /><br />if you're still reading this, comment whether I should move to LA or Europe after graduating college!!!{% endraw %}
