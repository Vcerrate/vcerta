{% raw %}In 2005 Göteborg embarked on a six-year project to improve public transport for people with reduced mobility. As part of this, the city’s public transport authority identified and removed obstacles and barriers on streets and public areas, adapting in the process all tram and main bus stops. This, and its other work on improving accessibility, helped Göteborg win an award in 2014 for Europe’s best accessibility project. - See more at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.eltis.org/discover/case-studies/improving-accessibility-transport-goteborg-sweden#sthash.Uc3HGCuK.dpuf">http://www.eltis.org/discover/case-studies/improving-accessibility-transport-goteborg-sweden#sthash.Uc3HGCuK.dpuf</a>{% endraw %}
