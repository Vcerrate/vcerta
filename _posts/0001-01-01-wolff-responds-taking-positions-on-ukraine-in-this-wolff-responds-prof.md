{% raw %}In this Wolff Responds, Prof. Wolff speaks about the ongoing war in Ukraine. Rather than using black and white language to enforce a “good vs evil” lens, Prof. Wolff explains how we don’t need to accept the choices we are given. This situation is deeply complex and in order to look closely at the grey area, we cannot fall victim to a reductionist lens. We can critique all powers involved—Russia, Ukraine, and the United States—while at the same time disavowing war as a tactic to deal with power struggles and standing with the Ukrainian people whose safety should never have been compromised amidst this conflict. <br /><br />Wolff Responds is a@Democracy At Work production.
