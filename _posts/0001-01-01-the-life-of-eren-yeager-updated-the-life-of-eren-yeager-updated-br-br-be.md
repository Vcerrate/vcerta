He is the only son of Grisha and Carla Jaeger, the adoptive brother of Mikasa Ackermann, the younger paternal half brother of Zeke Jaeger and the current holder of the Attack Titan, Founding Titan, and the War Hammer Titan. Eren was born and raised in Shiganshina District, which is located on the southern edge of Wall Maria. He lived there until the year 845, when the Colossal and Armored Titans breached the Wall, allowing a flood of Titans to invade and destroy the city. During the incident, Eren witnessed his mother being murdered and eaten by a smiling Titan. This event aroused in Eren an intense hatred towards the Titans, and he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the earth. Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Jaeger, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria. He then injected Eren with a Titan injection. Two years later, Eren along with his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackermann and his best friend Armin Arlelt joined the 104th Cadet Corps. The three successfully graduated, with Eren ranking as the 5th best cadet, and they joined the Scout Regiment following the struggle for Trost. After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the sea. Eren currently possesses the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titan. After eating Lara Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.<br /><br />***<br /><br />CHAPTERS<br /><br />00:00:00 Intro<br />00:02:06 Background<br />00:04:15 The Fall of Shiganshina arc<br />00:06:52 Humanity's Comeback arc<br />00:09:24 The Struggle for Trost arc<br />00:12:59 Eve of the Counterattack arc<br />00:15:00 The 57th Exterior Scouting Mission arc<br />00:17:12 Assault on Stohess arc<br />00:19:47 Clash of the Titans arc<br />00:25:34 The Uprising arc<br />00:33:38 Return to Shiganshina arc<br />00:40:20 Marley arc<br />00:48:29 War for Paradis arc<br />01:02:13 Abilities: Martial Arts<br />01:02:37 Abilities: Omni-directional Mobility Gear<br />01:03:39 Abilities: Attack Titan<br />01:06:11 Abilities: Regeneration<br />01:07:01 Abilities: Enhanced Strength<br />01:07:52 Abilities: Enhanced Endurance<br />01:08:25 Abilities: Hardening<br />01:09:19 Abilities: Founding Titan<br />01:10:09 Abilities: War Hammer Titan<br /><br />***<br /><br />FOLLOW ME<br /><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ethanschulteis/">https://www.instagram.com/ethanschulteis/</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/the_amagi">https://twitter.com/the_amagi</a><br />VLOG CHANNEL: @Ethan Schulteis <br />SECOND CHANNEL: @The Amagi 2 <br /><br />***<br /><br />ATTACK ON TITAN WIKI<br /><br />WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com">https://attackontitan.fandom.com</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AoTWiki">https://twitter.com/AoTWiki</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AttackOnTitanWiki">https://www.facebook.com/AttackOnTitanWiki</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/attackontitanwiki">https://instagram.com/attackontitanwiki</a><br />DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/attackontitan">https://discord.gg/attackontitan</a><br /><br />***<br /><br />COLORED MANGA<br /><br />REDDIT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SCNK_Official/">https://www.reddit.com/user/SCNK_Official/</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SCNK_Official">https://twitter.com/SCNK_Official</a><br /><br />***<br /><br />CREDITS<br /><br />PRODUCER: @Ethan Schulteis <br />NARRATOR: @Adrian Apolonio <br />WRITER: @Attack On Titan Wiki<br />EDITOR: @Imubi5<br />MUSIC: @Christian Andersen{% endraw %}
