{% raw %}One look at today’s headlines is proof enough that something is wrong with the American people. Most of us know there is something wrong, yet we haven’t quite gotten hold of just what it is. <br /><br />Roy Masters very quickly gets to the heart of things when he tells us, “Life is not about you.” He takes the time to walk us through those subtle things that hold us back in life, especially in the relationships between men and women.<br /><br />Many of us could be an agent of positive change, but first there has to be a change inside. And for that, a sacrifice is required.<br /><br />Change how you react under stress: www.AntidoteForAll.com<br />  <br />Listen to more of Roy’s talks and radio programs: www.FHU.com<br /><br />Call the Foundation of Human Understanding at 800 877-3227 Pacific Coast business hours.<br /><br />Purchase this program -<br /><br />Audio Download  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.fhu2.org/8653D.html">http://www.fhu2.org/8653D.html</a><br />DVD <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.fhu2.org/8653DVD.html">http://www.fhu2.org/8653DVD.html</a><br />CD  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.fhu2.org/8653CD.html">http://www.fhu2.org/8653CD.html</a><br /><br />Music by Jon Luc Hefferman - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Jon_Luc_Hefferman/Production_Music_1841/Curious_1577">http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Jon_Luc_Hefferman/Production_Music_1841/Curious_1577</a>{% endraw %}
