With over $5 billion dollar of real estate sales over the course of their careers, James Harris &amp; David Parnes have very impressive resumes. As a result, they always adding a lot to the million dollar listing show, and they'll definitely be missed! $5 billion dollars worth of sales equates to around $75 million dollars in net commissions over their careers, so something tells me that these 2 will end up financially alright as they continue to pursue selling luxury mega mansions in bel air, Beverly Hills, holmby hills, Brentwood, the pacific palisades, and Brentwood. <br /><br />I hope that you enjoy this video and if you have comments please leave them  below!
