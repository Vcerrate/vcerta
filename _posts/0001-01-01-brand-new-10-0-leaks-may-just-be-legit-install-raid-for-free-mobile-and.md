While we do have quite a bit of evidence for dragon making an appearance in the next wow expansion after Shadowlands I do believe it won't be just dragons.<br /><br />We have some new Lordaeron information, as well as new information in regards to Jailer ending and Denathrius' future which might reveal what is to come and spoiler alert it more than likely won't be the Empire of Dragons. <br /><br />All of the footage used in the video is copyrighted by Blizzard Entertainment unless stated otherwise. Due to images being shared across various sites it is quite difficult to find who the original artists are.
