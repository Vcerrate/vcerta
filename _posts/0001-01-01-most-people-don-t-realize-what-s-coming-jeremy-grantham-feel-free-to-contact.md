The comparison of the volatility of Reppond Investments, Inc.’s strategies to the volatility of any stock market index is for illustrative purposes only. The differences between Reppond Investments Inc.’s results and those of the indices may be different due to differences in diversification and by the properties of the actual securities held by Reppond Investments, Inc.  Different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific investment will be profitable or not.<br /><br />Reppond Investments, Inc. does not make any guarantee that our strategies will or are likely to achieve returns like those shown in the performance graph in this presentation. Reppond Investments, Inc. reserves the right to trade different ETFs or mutual funds within a strategy than those reflected in the graphic shown.  Stock market indices are unmanaged, broadly based indices, which differ in numerous respects from the specific portfolio composition. An investor cannot invest directly in these.  Dividends and income are included in the index returns. The S&amp;P 500 is a trademarked term of the McGraw Hill Company, and index data was compiled from sources we believe to be reliable.  However, Reppond Investments, Inc. makes no representations or guarantees with respect to the accuracy or completeness of that type of data.<br /><br />Past performance is not indicative of future results. Therefore, no current or prospective client should assume that future performance will be profitable. The historical performance results for indices and index funds, used as proxies for indices, are provided exclusively for comparison purposes.  They are intended to provide general comparative information to help an individual client or prospective client in deciding whether the performance of Reppond Investments, Inc.’s strategies meet, or continue to meet, his/her investment objective(s).  An investor should not assume that any strategy used by Reppond Investments, Inc. will directly correspond to any such comparative index.<br /><br />Different types of investments and/or investment strategies involve varying levels of risk. There can be no assurance that any specific investment or investment strategy (including the investment strategies devised or undertaken by Reppond Investments, Inc.) will be profitable for a client’s or prospective client’s portfolio. All performance results have been compiled solely by Reppond Investments, Inc. and are from sources we believe to be reliable. They have not been independently audited or verified.<br /><br />Investments in securities involve risk and the loss of investment principal is possible. Investments in securities will not always be profitable.{% endraw %}
