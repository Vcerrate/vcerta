{% raw %}The Objective <br />Koji Nakagawa<br />R4 / Ridge Racer Type 4 / Direct Audio<br /><br />In-Game Track 11<br />Plays for Brightest Nite as PRC and RTS, and Edge of the Earth for DRT.<br />Always imagined this one beginning, in video form, with a slowly focusing light at the end of a dark tunnel coming into view, while cutting to the machines getting ready to roll.  Yes, this is how I envision video game songs: directorially.{% endraw %}
