{% raw %}Life on a farm is a school of patience; you can't hurry the crops or make an ox in two days. Their patience is paid off when they harvest, and they celebrate it like a festival called Okkalaata in Karnataka. I had an amazing day with the farmers where I got to learn a lot about this tradition.
