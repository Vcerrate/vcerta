{% raw %}I + I2C = I3C: What's in this Additional 'I'? - Boris Brezillon, Bootlin (formerly Free Electrons)<br /><br />The MIPI Alliance recently released version 1 of the I3C (pronounce 'eye-three-see') bus specification, which is supposed to be an improvement over the long-standing I2C and SPI protocols. Compared to I2C/SPI, I3C provides a higher data rate, lower power consumption and additional features such as dynamic address assignment, host join, in-band interrupts. For the last year or so, Free Electrons has been working with Cadence Design Systems on supporting this new kind of bus in Linux.<br /><br />With this talk we would like to introduce this new bus and the concepts it brings to the table. We will also detail how we plan to expose the new features exposed by the I3C protocol in Linux and go through future possible improvements of the I3C framework that has already been submitted for review on the Linux kernel mailing list. <br /><br />About Boris Brezillon<br />Since 2014, Boris works at Bootlin (formerly Free Electrons), a company offering development, consulting and training services to embedded Linux system developers worldwide. He has been working on embedded systems since 2008, mostly Linux on ARM. Boris is the maintainer of the MTD NAND subsystem, and has contributed to the support for Atmel and Allwinner ARM SoCs in the Linux kernel. He has recently been involved in the development of a new subsystem to expose the I3C bus in Linux.{% endraw %}
