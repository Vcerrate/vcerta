I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) <br /><br />📧Contact<br />========================<br />youtube: youtube comments are by far the best way to get a response from me! <br />linkedin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinaw-h/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinaw-h/</a> <br />email for business inquiries only: hellotinah@gmail.com <br /><br />========================<br />Some links are affiliate links and I may receive a small portion of sales price at no cost to you.
