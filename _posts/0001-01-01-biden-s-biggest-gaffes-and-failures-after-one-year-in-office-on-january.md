{% raw %}ON January 20, 2021, Joe Biden vowed to overcome Covid and pledged America would &quot;lead by example&quot; in the world following years of unpredictability during the Trump administration<br /><br />But, during his first year in office, the US has been blighted by foreign policy blunders in Afghanistan and is facing the prospect of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.<br /><br />And back home, the US is in a fight against the highly transmissible Omicron Covid-19 variant. <br /><br />Polling paints a grim picture for the Biden administration as 62 percent disapprove of the president’s handling of the economy, while 69 percent say the White House’s Covid messaging has been confusing. <br /><br />And, US party preferences appear to have shifted as 47 percent say they are either strong or lean Republican - a seven-point rise compared to the first quarter of 2021, according to Gallup.<br /><br />Meanwhile, only 42 percent of Americans identify themselves as strong or lean Democrats, down from 49 percent at the start of 2021.<br /><br />The last time the GOP held a five-point lead in party advantage was 1995 when they had just taken control of the House for the first time since the 1950s.<br /><br />The Sun takes a look at the crises that have plagued the Biden Administration in his first year in office.<br /><br />Continue reading<br />Inside Biden’s seven biggest gaffes and failures from falling up stairs of Air Force One to weakness on world stage<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17384769/joe-biden-gaffes-failures-one-year-presidency/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17384769/joe-biden-gaffes-failures-one-year-presidency/</a><br /><br />The Sun newspaper brings you the latest breaking news videos and explainers from the UK and around the world<br /><br />Become a Sun Subscriber and hit the bell to be the first to know<br /><br />Read The Sun: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk">http://www.thesun.co.uk</a><br />Like The Sun on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thesun/">https://www.facebook.com/thesun/</a><br />Follow The Sun on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheSun">https://twitter.com/TheSun</a><br />Subscribe to The Sun on Snapchat: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.snapchat.com/discover/The_Sun/1633225139">https://www.snapchat.com/discover/The_Sun/1633225139</a>{% endraw %}
