{% raw %}Life on a farm is a load of crap! And I have TONS of it to move today! To make the job easier, I bought a new tine bucket for the Farmall 656, and it works great. Afterwards, it's time to feed the cattle (they look a whole lot shorter, BTW), and take care of other chores on the farm.<br /><br />Note:<br />-We do not offer farm tours or accept visitors<br />-We do not sell from the farm<br />-We do not ship our farm's products<br />-We do not sell live animals<br /><br />Mailing Address:<br />Just a Few Acres Farm<br />PO Box 269<br />Lansing, NY  14882<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/justafewacresfarm/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/justafewacresfarm/?hl=en</a><br /><br />To order Pete's book; &quot;A Year and a Day on Just a Few Acres:&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Year-Day-Just-Few-Acres/dp/149549957X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NM8AQPCG3IT5&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=a+year+and+a+day+on+just+a+few+acres&amp;qid=1587327049&amp;sprefix=a+year+and+a+day+on+just%2Caps%2C183&amp;sr=8-1">https://www.amazon.com/Year-Day-Just-Few-Acres/dp/149549957X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NM8AQPCG3IT5&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=a+year+and+a+day+on+just+a+few+acres&amp;qid=1587327049&amp;sprefix=a+year+and+a+day+on+just%2Caps%2C183&amp;sr=8-1</a>{% endraw %}
