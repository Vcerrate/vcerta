The resolution is determined by the range set on a digital multimter. As an added benefit, all Fluke digital multimeters have been upgraded to measure up to 6,000 counts; making your job easier when taking measurements. <br /><br />The Fluke 87V Industrial Multimeter provides the resolution and accuracy needed to efficiently troubleshoot motor drives, plant automation, power distribution, and electromechanical equipment even in loud, high energy, and high altitude locations. A low pass filter supports accurate frequency measurements on VFDs and captures intermittents as fast 250 ÂµS. The Fluke 87V also includes a built-in thermometer so you can take temperature readings without having to carry a separate instrument.<br /><br />For more information on the Fluke 87V Industrial Multimeter, visit the Fluke website here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Le2Elz">http://bit.ly/2Le2Elz</a>{% endraw %}
