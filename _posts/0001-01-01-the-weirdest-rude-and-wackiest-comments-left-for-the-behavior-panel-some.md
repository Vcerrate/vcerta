Together they analyze the body language and behavior displayed in videos in the public interest. The Behavior Panel is a non-partisan group, looking to educate and entertain the public with their interest and expertise in nonverbal communication, body language, deception detection, interrogation, and resistance to interrogation. By looking at the gestures, facial expressions, micro-expressions, and context around what people say, this group of nonverbal behavior experts reveals the possible truth and deceptions. This behavior profiler group takes on the task of investigating the behavior behind the true crime news that often forces us to think and feel the way we do. The Behavior Panel is featured on The Dr. Phil Show.<br /><br />The content provided by The Behavior Panel is for expressive purposes only.
