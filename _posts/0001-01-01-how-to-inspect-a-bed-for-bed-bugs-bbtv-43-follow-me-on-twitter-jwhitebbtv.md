{% raw %}FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER: @JWhiteBBTV - In this episode Jeff will explain the areas on a bed you should inspect if you want to inspect your bed for bed bugs.  As information spreads about bed bug infestations on the rise, more and more people want to inspect their bed for bed bugs.  This episode will walk you through a bed inspection and the critical areas you should look if you want to inspect your bed for bed bugs.  Please be aware that a visual inspection can be unreliable when trying to detect low level infestations of bed bugs.  Therefore, if you perform an inspection and don't find any bed bugs, it does not necessarily mean you don't have bed bugs in your home.  A knowledgeable professional should always be contacted if you think you may have bed bugs.{% endraw %}
