{% raw %}Jen Pan speaks with Anton Jäger about his new article on “hyper-politics”: while a constant, low-stakes political discourse suffuses everything now, very little improves. Jäger contrasts hyper-politics to both the post-politics of neoliberalism and the mass institutional politics of the traditional left. Hyper-politics has low-stakes for entry, participation, and exit. The result is a stream of fleeting, impermanent political moments that add up to very little. Jäger considers how we might move from hyper-politics back to the mass institutional working-class politics that saw real gains in the past. <br /><br />Find Anton's latest Jacobin article here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jacobinmag.com/2022/01/hyper-politics-annie-ernaux-moralism-identity-media-individualization">https://jacobinmag.com/2022/01/hyper-politics-annie-ernaux-moralism-identity-media-individualization</a><br /><br />Subscribe to the channel and hit the like button!<br />Subscribe to Jacobin in print for just $10: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jacobinmag.com/subscribe/?code=JACOBINYT">https://jacobinmag.com/subscribe/?code=JACOBINYT</a><br />Music provided by Zonkey: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/zonkey">https://linktr.ee/zonkey</a>{% endraw %}
