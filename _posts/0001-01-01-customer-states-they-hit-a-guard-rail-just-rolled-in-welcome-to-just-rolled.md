The technician said the driver's side was ripped off the rails and the road they were driving on has a speed limit of 110 km/h (68mp/h). <br />0:27 You should never require that many wheel weights to balance a tire. <br />They're all over the place, so whoever balanced them didn't know what they were doing. It's also possible the rear wheels are bent and whoever balanced the rear tires didn't see that and added enough weights until it was &quot;balanced&quot; according to the machine.<br />0:44 That's a front-wheel hub extension for an F-350 Dually (didn't mention what year). Those need to be properly torqued when installed. <br />0:56 Mechanic thinks somebody might have put the rock underneath the engine cover as a prank. He also said: &quot;Maybe they thought the rock would keep rodents out or something? There is rodent debris all over, but the rock has Me completely stumped.&quot;<br />1:10 This really sucks for the customer! But my guess is that somebody else with the same truck, needed a whole new exhaust system so they stole the one-off of this customer's truck. The only piece of the exhaust still there is the exhaust manifolds (that would be a lot harder to steal lol).<br />1:24 The exhaust on the driver's side is just for show lol. Looks to be on a KIA Soul.<br />1:30 Tesla has a lot of different features and quirks. You can make it make a farting noise every time you use your blinkers. <br />1:42 Mechanic said: The bearing destroyed the knuckle, shredded the CV axle boot, the caliper leaked all the fluid out of the pistons, the wheel rubbed against the upper control arm.&quot;<br />1:57 It's supposed to be Grand Cherokee lol. <br />2:05 The service writer shouldn't have even written up this on the work order. The technician who got this work order must have had a good laugh or been really pissed off.<br />2:15 Mechanic said: &quot;Has under 30,000 miles (48280 kilometres). Cylinder 1 piston/rod had a catastrophic failure. Severe gauging/breakage of the cylinder. The windage tray and block now have breather holes. It is getting a new long block and turbo. $20,000 (block only).&quot; He also mentioned it's covered under warranty. Lucky customer!<br />2:32 The technician also said the rear brake lines were pinched off. Maybe the customer was converting it to rear disc brakes but didn't finish?<br />2:45 Mechanic said: &quot;Had no communication with the TCM codes, turns out there's a TSB relating to wire corrosion/pin issues and it tells you to check about 15 different places on the vehicle for corrosion/places where water could have got in. The top of the TSB specifically says do not replace any modules until you verify every place of concern checks out good. But yeah this thing was doing some funky shit, started of with the speedo going haywire, then the PRNDL switch indicating different gears, then the locks unlocking/locking, and the transmission went into limp mode as well. Pulled over, popped the battery terminals off, and hard reset it to be able to drive 3 miles back to the shop.&quot;<br />2:51 Mechanic said: &quot;So what happened here was, we had a really bad blizzard and the customer came in saying that all of their lights were on and no heat especially and when we popped the hood we see this terrific mess of snow like wtf ?? Customer never popped the hood, it was left outside during the storm so looks like it was all the wind that absolutely piled up. And it was PACKED. left it to thaw overnight. Ran normal after everything was dry, no problems since.. a mystery to this day maybe they really did leave the hood open lol IDK man.&quot;<br />3:02 A really cool turbo lamp made with a turbo, camshaft, and ring gear. Thought you guys would like to see this.<br />3:09 Outro. Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
