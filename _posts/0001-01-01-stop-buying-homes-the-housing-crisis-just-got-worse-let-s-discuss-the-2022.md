As for WHY this happens, it was explained that increasing mortgage rates USUALLY occur due to improving economic conditions or rising inflation expectations….as a result, OTHER factors in the economy that generally accompany those rising interest rates usually prevent prices from crashing down. <br /><br />Another study also seconds this, while confirming that “it’s hard to see any correlation for rising rates causing lower prices” - HOWEVER - it DOES appear that this is a FACTOR to price affordability, in addition to: Housing supply, The Economy, Lending guidelines, Population changes, New construction, and Home affordability. <br /><br />NEW MORTGAGE OPTIONS<br /><br />Beginning NOW - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac INCREASED their loan sizes by 18%, resulting in a maximum loan of $1 MILLION DOLLARS throughout over 100 high cost of living areas. On the one hand, this gives buyers more room to purchase a home in these current conditions…and given how quickly prices have been rising, the new loan limits would simply “BUMP UP” to match where the market is selling.<br /><br />But, on the other hand...”some housing experts say the expected jump in loan limits raises questions about the appropriate role of the government in housing… and whether taxpayers should effectively backstop sky-high housing prices, when Fannie and Freddie’s market share is already rising.” <br /><br />RISING RENTS: <br /><br />It’s common that RENTAL PRICES tend to lag HOUSING VALUES by as much as several years, since - when you sign a lease - you typically lock yourself into a scheduled price, during which - your rent stays the same. However, 1 to 2 years LATER - once that term is up - the landlord is free to raise rents, sometimes to market value, which is why we don’t often see rent increases until much, much later…or, in this case, TODAY. <br /><br />For renters…if you’re worried about prices increasing…NOW would be a good time to negotiate with your landlord to lock in a longer lease term, or - consider seeing other options in the area to make sure you’re getting a fair price. Ultimately, the burden is going to fall on you to make sure you’re not getting ripped off…so, a little research absolutely goes a long way. <br /><br />If you’re looking to buy a home - do your best to shop around, make yourself as strong of a buyer as possible, lock in a 30-year mortgage at the lowest rate you can find, and then…be patient. <br /><br />My ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB">https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB</a><br /><br />For business or one-on-one real estate investing/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com<br /><br />*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
