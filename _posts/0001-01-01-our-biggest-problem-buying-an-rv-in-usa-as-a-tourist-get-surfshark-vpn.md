The process of buying and registering our 80s campervan went relatively smoothly and quickly. However, the next step of getting our vintage camper van ready for its first Big American Road Trip is not going to plan. It has been stuck at the mechanics for weeks and we have no idea when we will be getting it back. <br /><br />Be sure to hit that notification bell to be notified of future content coming soon! üîî<br /><br />‚≠ê Come Say Hello!<br />‚ñπFacebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/TravelBeans">https://facebook.com/TravelBeans</a><br />‚ñπInstagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/travel_beans">https://instagram.com/travel_beans</a> <br /><br />‚≠ê EQUIPMENT WE USE:<br />Our Drone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beansdrone">https://geni.us/beansdrone</a><br />Our Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beanscamera">https://geni.us/beanscamera</a><br />Our Lenses: <br />Wide - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beansmainlens">https://geni.us/beansmainlens</a><br />Tight - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beanslonglens">https://geni.us/beanslonglens</a><br />Microphone - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beansmic">https://geni.us/beansmic</a><br />GoPro - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beansgopro">https://geni.us/beansgopro</a><br />Small Tripod - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beanstripod1">https://geni.us/beanstripod1</a><br />Big Tripod - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beanstripod2">https://geni.us/beanstripod2</a><br />Laptop - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beanslaptop">https://geni.us/beanslaptop</a><br /><br />‚≠ê SERVICES WE USE:<br />‚ñπWhere We Find Our Music (Epidemic Sound) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/travelbeans">http://share.epidemicsound.com/travelbeans</a><br />‚ñπHelpful YouTube Tools (TubeBuddy) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/TRAVELBEANS">https://www.tubebuddy.com/TRAVELBEANS</a><br /><br />‚ñπTeach English Online &amp; Earn Money - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cambly.com/en/tutors?referralCode=emma145">https://www.cambly.com/en/tutors?referralCode=emma145</a><br /><br />‚ñπTravel + Medical Insurance For Nomads (SafetyWing) *Now Includes COVID-19 Coverage*<br />Nomad Insurance: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.safetywing.com/?referenceID=24739299">https://www.safetywing.com/?referenceID=24739299</a><br />Remote Health: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://safetywing.com/remote-health?referenceID=24739299">https://safetywing.com/remote-health?referenceID=24739299</a><br /><br />‚ñπSkyRoam Personal WiFi - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.skyroam.com/?rfsn=2382845.b5fb86">https://www.skyroam.com/?rfsn=2382845.b5fb86</a><br /><br />NOTE: Some of these may be affiliate links, which means when you buy something we may receive a small commission.

On this channel, you‚Äôll find a variety of travel and vlog content, in which you‚Äôll see us in places like Thailand, Japan, USA, Slovenia, and more.<br /><br />In 2017 we left home with just ¬£500 in our bank account and a dream to make a sustainable travel lifestyle happen! We are now living our dream as digital nomads and want to inspire you to create your own story, whatever it may be!<br /><br />After 5 years of aimless, yet enjoyable, backpacking around the world we found ourselves in New York City battling with depression. At this point, we decided to go home and confront this problem head-on. After 6 tough months at home we decided to go away again, but this time with a goal in mind.. to turn travel into a lifestyle.<br /><br />Our time spent battling depression has influenced our outlook on life dramatically! We are now traveling the world in search of what makes us happy. In our vlogs, we talk openly and honestly about our travel experiences, the digital nomad life and depression. We hope our videos can help to inspire you to create a life that makes you happy!<br /><br />‚≠ê Make sure to Subscribe to our channel for more videos like this one! ‚≠ê{% endraw %}
