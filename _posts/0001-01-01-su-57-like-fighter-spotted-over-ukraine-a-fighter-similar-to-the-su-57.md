{% raw %}A fighter similar to the Su-57 was spotted in northern Ukraine.<br />A few hours ago, over the Zhytomyr region of Ukraine, local residents noticed a fighter aircraft, which, in terms of its design features and engine sound, is almost identical to the fifth-generation Su-57 fighter. Officially, the use of these combat aircraft was not announced.<br />On the presented video footage, filmed in the Berdichev area (Zhytomyr region), you can see the bombing. Apparently, the strike was delivered immediately after sunset, however, local residents noticed an unusual sound, and later reported that it was an aircraft that was visually very similar to the Su-57. Due to the low quality of the footage, it is impossible to say with certainty that we are really talking about the use of the Su-57 fighter, especially since the Russian Ministry of Defense has not officially announced the use of these combat aircraft. Nevertheless, there is definitely a visual resemblance between the aircraft seen over Berdichev and the Su-57 fighter. According to official data, to date, only one fifth-generation Su-57 serial fighter is in service with the Russian Aerospace Forces, however, at the end of last year it became known that two more aircraft were transferred to the Russian defense department{% endraw %}
