{% raw %}Dan Simons explores why we see the world as it ISN'T.<br /><br /><br /><br />Daniel Simons is head of the Visual Cognition Laboratory at the University of Illinois. His research explores the ways in which our beliefs and intuitions about the workings of our own minds are often mistaken and why that matters. He is best known for his experiments revealing striking failures of perception and the limits of visual awareness. His research is exhibited in science museums worldwide and his writing has been published in many newspapers and magazines, including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, and The Chicago Tribune. He recently co-authored the book, &quot;The Invisible Gorilla, and Other Ways Our Intuitions Deceive Us&quot; (Crown, 2010).<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dansimons.com">http://www.dansimons.com</a><br /><br /><br /><br />This talk was recorded at TEDxUIUC 2011 (02/19/11), which was organized at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign by a group of students led by Cristian Mitreanu.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.tedxuiuc.com">http://www.tedxuiuc.com</a><br /><br /><br /><br />About TEDx, x = independently organized event<br /><br /><br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ted.com">http://www.ted.com</a>{% endraw %}
