{% raw %}In a joint venture with our friends at This Is Flight, we bring you some of the best highlights of EAA AirVenture 2021 in Oshkosh, WI! <br /><br />Look for unique homebuilt aircraft like Bally's Bomber (a scale B-17!), vintage airliners like the Samaritan's Purse DC-8, plus special arrivals and departures like a German Air Force A400 Atlas and a Boeing 747-8F. Oshkosh's legendary mass formations are featured along with different warbird themes throughout the week like light warbirds and vintage jet warbirds. We run down the special &quot;75 years plus 1&quot; commemoration of the end of World War II: a two hour airshow segment that used more than 40 warbirds to highlight major events during the war like the attack on Pearl Harbor, the D-Day landings, and the air war in Europe. <br /><br />&quot;Two Buck Chuck&quot; with AirVenture first-timers Erik Edgren and RJ Gritter showcases affordable aerobatic aircraft while the 2022 edition of Adventures of Aviore brings together airshow all-stars in a creative performance. Aviation of all types is celebrated with flybys by agricultural crop sprayers, a Goodyear Blimp demonstration, and innovative electric VTOL aircraft like the bizarre-looking Volocopter. <br /><br />We slow things down with a look at the twilight STOL demonstration on the ultralight runway before speeding things up with the US Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) demonstrations featuring an airfield takeover by MC-130s, CV-22 Ospreys, AC-47/AC-130 gunship heritage flight, and an eye-popping night flare dump. The military action continues with rarely seen AFSOC types like the U-28 Draco and C-146 Wolfhound, an A-10 Warthog field attack demo, US Air Force Heritage Flight, U-2 Dragon Lady flyby, and the F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-18 Super Hornet demonstration teams.<br /><br />Our friends at This Is Flight have many videos just like this one on their youtube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/thisisflight">https://www.youtube.com/c/thisisflight</a> Also be sure to check out their main website at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thisisflight.net/">http://thisisflight.net/</a><br /><br />HUGE thanks to AdamandJohnsDad for helping us out with the flare drop video! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2YVBszOP2SRbzFk0ynXiPQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2YVBszOP2SRbzFk0ynXiPQ</a><br /><br />This is the official channel of AirshowStuff, the premiere source for air show and aviation videos.
