{% raw %}We joined Parker Stinson for a &quot;big boy&quot; Half Marathon specific workout at his training base in Boulder, Colorado on May 9th 2021.  <br />The session: 1km hard, 5km tempo, 1km hard, 5km tempo, 1km hard with 3min recovery between all. <br /><br />Boulder sits at an elevation of around 1600m (5300ft) which for an athlete completely acclimatised to the altitude, will convert to around 3-4sec per kilometre (or 5-6sec per mile) slower than training at sea level. <br /><br />Sweat Elite Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sweatelite/">https://www.instagram.com/sweatelite/</a><br /><br />Parker Stinson Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/_parker_stinson_/">https://www.instagram.com/_parker_stinson_/</a><br /><br />Videographer (Matt Fox) Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mattinglisfox/">https://www.instagram.com/mattinglisfox/</a><br /><br />-- -- -- <br /><br />Want to see more videos?
