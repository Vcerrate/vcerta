{% raw %}The Texas real estate market is booming. Cities like Austin, Dallas, San Antonio, and humid Houston have seen their populations (and home prices) explode as Californians and New Yorkers flee their state taxes for hotter housing markets. The Houston real estate market isn‚Äôt as hyped up as the Lone Star State‚Äôs capital, Austin, but it does have a serious amount of real estate investors who are making it their own cash flow capital. <br /><br />Jamil Damji, master wholesaler and ‚ÄúOn The Market‚Äù expert guest, took a break from the arid desert of Phoenix to sweat it up, talk shop, and try some seriously delicious wings in Houston. He sits down with investor and agent, Michael Carabajal, to talk about why Houston has attracted not only so many homebuyers but real estate investors as well. They go over which neighborhoods work for cash flow vs. appreciation, who‚Äôs driving the runup in prices, and why Houston may be your next favorite real estate investing market.<br /><br />And of course, Jamil and his team also need to try the local chicken wings before they can make any serious decisions on whether this market is truly livable. If you want to start dipping your toes in the Texas market, Houston may be the single best city to start. <br /><br />~~~~<br />Join BiggerPockets for FREE üëá<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/signup?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/signup?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a>  <br />~~~~<br />Check out Last Week‚Äôs Episode on Exploring Boise: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/0B924VpqCsI">https://youtu.be/0B924VpqCsI</a> <br />~~~~<br />Listen to The ‚ÄúOn The Market‚Äù Podcast Wherever You Listen to Podcasts:<br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2NlzZ9NtHtZ2uBuaDNoGzY">https://open.spotify.com/show/2NlzZ9NtHtZ2uBuaDNoGzY</a><br />Apple Podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/on-the-market/id1615086704">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/on-the-market/id1615086704</a><br />BiggerPockets: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/podcasts?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/podcasts?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />~~~~<br />Investing in Houston‚ÄîDon‚Äôt Go It A-Lone in the Lone Star State:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/houston-real-estate">https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/houston-real-estate</a> <br />~~~~<br />Connect with Michael on BiggerPockets:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/michaelc1627">https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/michaelc1627</a> <br />~~~~<br />Follow Michael on Facebook and Instagram:<br />Instagram: @wiresplease or <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/wiresplease/">https://www.instagram.com/wiresplease/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.carbajal.777">https://www.facebook.com/michael.carbajal.777</a> <br />~~~~<br />Find an Investor-Friendly Agent in Your Area:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/agent/match?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=agent_finder_q2_2022">https://www.biggerpockets.com/agent/match?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=agent_finder_q2_2022</a> <br />~~~~<br />Try the Chicken Wings:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.agasrestaurant.com/">https://www.agasrestaurant.com/</a> <br />~~~~<br />Follow Jamil on Instagram:<br />@jdamji or <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jdamji/">https://www.instagram.com/jdamji/</a><br />~~~~<br />Connect with Jamil on BiggerPockets: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/jamild6?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/jamild6?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a><br /><br />00:00 The Hot (and Humid) Houston Housing Market<br />01:07 Chatting with a Top Houston Agent<br />01:56 What's Causing Houston to Boom?<br />02:55 Serious Investing Opportunity in Houston<br />07:13 Let's Try Some Wings{% endraw %}
