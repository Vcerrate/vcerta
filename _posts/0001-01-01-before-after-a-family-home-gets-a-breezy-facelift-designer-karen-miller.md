{% raw %}Designer Karen Miller turned a bland, closed-off home into a bright and airy sanctuary for her family. Tearing down walls let in plenty of light, while white oak flooring was a perfect solution for her active canine companions! A built-in banquette offers storage space and a cozy, intimate feel in the dining room. In the kitchen, beautiful porcelain countertops and an oversized island are kid-friendly. Old board and batten siding was torn down and the home re-clad with stately stone, including beautiful custom wooden windows. | Presented by Scotties.<br /><br />Design, Karen Miller, Modelo Interiors, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.modelointeriors.com/">https://www.modelointeriors.com/</a><br /><br />----------<br /><br />MORE DESIGN INSPIRATION<br />• Subscribe to H&amp;H's YouTube Channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/IZae51">https://goo.gl/IZae51</a><br />• Beautiful photo galleries <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://houseandhome.com/galleries/">https://houseandhome.com/galleries/</a><br /><br />----------<br /><br />CONNECT WITH HOUSE &amp; HOME!<br />• Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/houseandhomemagazine/">https://facebook.com/houseandhomemagazine/</a><br />• Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/houseandhomemag/">https://instagram.com/houseandhomemag/</a><br />• Pinterest <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pinterest.com/houseandhome/">https://pinterest.com/houseandhome/</a><br />• Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/HouseandHome">https://twitter.com/HouseandHome</a>{% endraw %}
