{% raw %}In a turn of events that is fitting of the reality show that modern politics has become, Donald Trump's staffers are now trying to blame Mitch McConnell for Trump's feud with Ron DeSantis. They made the shaky connection because DeSantis made his comments about Trump's &quot;lockdown&quot; orders on the podcast of McConnell's aide, so naturally they want Trump's most recent enemy to take the fall. Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins unpacks the soap opera drama taking place - and explains why Trump is taking the coward's way out. <br /><br />Link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/team-trump-blames-mcconnell-for-orchestrating-desantis-blow-up?ref=home">https://www.thedailybeast.com/team-trump-blames-mcconnell-for-orchestrating-desantis-blow-up?ref=home</a><br /><br />Become a member today!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join</a><br /><br />Support us by becoming a monthly patron on Patreon, and help keep progressive media alive!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire">https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire</a><br /><br />Find our merchandise at Teespring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store">https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store</a><br /><br />Spread the word!

And in true soap opera reality show fashion, they've said it's all because of dang it, Mitch McConnell. It's all Mitch McConnell's fault, folks. Trump doesn't wanna fight with DeSantis. DeSantis doesn't wanna fight with Trump. But that Mitch McConnell coming between the two and starting drama, because he is so mad that Donald Trump is out there attacking him. Now, here's what's going on. DeSantis as I mentioned yesterday, made comments about my biggest regret is not pushing back against Donald Trump's so-called lockdown, which never even happened.<br /><br />But he said this on a podcast that was hosted by one of Mitch McConnell's advisors. So, because this was said on a podcast hosted by a McConnell advisor, Trump's people are now saying, oh, well see McConnell set this all up. McConnell made this happen. I mean, here's the exact quote. I like Josh. Josh is great, but he's a wholly owned subsidiary of McConnell world. And there's no way you can tell me that this was all a coincidence. So they do see a conspiracy here. They legitimately believe that Mitch McConnell told the advisor to interview DeSantis and to ask him this question, to get him to say this answer that they could not guarantee any would happen. Like you had no way of guaranteeing DeSantis was going to give that answer. But down there at Mar-a-Lago, down in Trump world, oh no, they found the conspiracy. They know why the fighting is happening. Here's the thing.<br /><br />This actually makes Trump look even worse because rather than owning up to his attacks on DeSantis, you know, behind the scenes, calling him a dull, boring, whatever it is, Roger Stone calling, coming out and tweeting at him, calling him the, you know, fat guy with a bad haircut. Trump could own that. He could double down on his attacks. But what, what, what's happening here is he's actually backing down. DeSantis isn't backing down. Trump is backing down. Trump realizes that he has now picked a fight that he doesn't think he can win. So they're trying to scapegoat McConnell and this advisor's podcast trying to make them out to be the villain so that they might be able to repair the relationship between Trump and DeSantis. Trump is scared and I honestly don't think we have seen this man in this kind of position since he became president. But he not only views DeSantis as a threat, but he views him as somebody that he can't defeat even in a war of words. This is very telling about how Donald Trump is feeling right now, because they wouldn't be resorting to these conspiracies if Trump thought he could beat DeSantis one on one.{% endraw %}
