{% raw %}Based on a real workplace example, this animation demonstrates how different attitudes drive our behaviour and, in turn, the results we get when engaging with safety. Safety Attitudes at Work is an excerpt from a Sentis research study of more than 21,000 participants from 73 sites across agriculture, construction, government, healthcare, manufacturing, mining, oil and gas, and utilities.

We equip employees with the knowledge, skills and motivation to make safer choices, each and every day. Since the introduction of our pioneering psychology-based safety programs in 2003, we've empowered more than 400 companies and 165,000 individuals to think differently about safety.
