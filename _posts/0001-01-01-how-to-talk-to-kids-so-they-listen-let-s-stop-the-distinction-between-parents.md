{% raw %}Let's stop the distinction between parents and kids because kids are people too. Honor them, honor them for the view and the position that they have because just like us, they have a perspective and their perspective is good too.<br /><br />In this video, Dr. Paul shares with us how to turn our words from garbage into gold and what really is personal integrity for us parents. When we talk to our kids, our focus is going to impact how they respond to us, it's about time to get our focus off of ourselves.<br /><br />Watch and Enjoy!<br />Dr. Paul Jenkins<br /><br />HELP &amp; RESOURCES:<br />========================<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.drpauljenkins.com/">http://www.drpauljenkins.com/</a><br />Books &amp; CD’s: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://drpauljenkins.com/products/">http://drpauljenkins.com/products/</a><br /><br />MUSIC<br />========================<br />Track: Kisma - We Are [NCS Release]<br />Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br />Watch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/WfluodjOkOk">https://youtu.be/WfluodjOkOk</a><br />Licensed under Creative Commons — Attribution 3.0<br /><br />========================<br />Video by Nate Woodbury<br />BeTheHeroStudios.com<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://YouTube.com/NateWoodburyHer">http://YouTube.com/NateWoodburyHer</a>{% endraw %}
