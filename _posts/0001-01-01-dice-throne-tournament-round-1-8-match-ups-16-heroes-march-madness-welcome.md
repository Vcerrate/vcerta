Select from a variety of heroes that play and feel completely distinct from one another. Attack opponents and activate abilities by rolling your hero's unique set of five dice. Accumulate combat points and spend them on cards that have a large range of effects, such as granting permanent hero upgrades, applying status effects, and manipulating dice directly (yours, your teammate's, or even your opponent's).<br /><br />Publisher: Dice Throne/Roxley<br />Player Count: 2-6<br />Mechanisms: Dice Rolling, Take That, Variable Player Powers<br />..............................................................................................................<br />Jump: <br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />01:50 - House Keeping<br />03:21 - Treant VS Shadow Thief <br />15:31 - Ninja VS Barbarian<br />20:53 - Paladin VS Monk<br />30:34 - Moon Elf VS Pyromancer<br />34:59 - Cursed Pirate VS Tactician<br />42:40 - Seraph VS Huntress<br />48:07 - Vampire Lord VS Gunslinger<br />57:07 - Samurai VS Artificer <br />1:00:42 - Wrap Up<br />..............................................................................................................<br />Follow Us on Social Media<br /><br />Instagram: @fosterthemeeple<br />Twitter: @fosterthemeeple<br />Facebook: facebook.com/fosterthemeeple <br /><br />Contact us for collabs and partnerships<br />Email: fosterthemeeple@gmail.com<br />..............................................................................................................<br />Do you live in Halifax/Nova Scotia?
