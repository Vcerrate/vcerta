But is it all just in his mind?<br /><br />&quot;LAIKA&quot; by Adam Fair<br /><br />Connect with the Filmmakers: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://laikashortfilm.com/">https://laikashortfilm.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/adamofthefair/">https://www.instagram.com/adamofthefair/</a><br /><br />More About &quot;LAIKA&quot;:<br />In 1958, Laika became the first animal launched into space. Witnessed by a young boy with dreams of following in her footsteps... she never returned. Decades later something has gone terribly wrong on the International Space Station and now, Russian Cosmonaut Oleg Kotov, struggles to regain control of his tumbling escape pod. Houston has picked him up on radar and Ground Control endeavours to bring him into a stable orbit. However, it soon becomes clear they are dealing with more than just a broken spacecraft, but a broken pilot too. Unresponsive to basic commands, a confession of dead crewmates and the belief he is being followed, Oleg slowly loses his mind to fear. An increasingly exasperated mission controller decides to take matters into her own hands and bring Oleg back down to Earth, but this only confirms Olegs’ worst fears. A mysterious, antiquated looking craft docks with Olegs’ returning with it a nation's “sacrificial lamb”.<br /><br />&quot;LAIKA&quot; Credits:<br />Cast <br />Commander Oleg - Anton Saunders<br />Mission Controller - Roisin Monaghan<br />Young Oleg - Alexander Kaczmarek<br /> <br />Crew <br />Director/Writer - Adam Fair<br />Producers - Karen Taylor/ Alison White<br />Executive Producer - John Sanderson<br />Director of Photography - Tighe Grainger<br />Hair &amp; Makeup - Amanda Ellis<br />Visual Effects - penelopevfx<br />VFX editor - Adam Fair<br />Lead Animator - Adam Kaczmarek<br />Lead Modeller - Xavier Gibbons<br />Lead Roto &amp; prep - Alison White<br />Original Music by Alistair Kerley<br />Orchestrated by Alistair Kerley<br />Conducted by Peter Pejtsik<br />Performed by the Budapest Art Orchestra<br />Viola - Kay Stephens<br />Score Mixer - Frankie Harper<br />Sound Design - Ben Sanders<br />Mix Supervisor - James Sutcliffe <br /><br />Subscribe to the DUST Newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eepurl.com/gnTIbD">http://eepurl.com/gnTIbD</a><br />Subscribe to DUST on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2aqc5vh">http://bit.ly/2aqc5vh</a><br /><br />#DUST #scifi #shortfilm <br /><br />About DUST:<br />DUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.
