{% raw %}Do you often wake up between 3 am - 5 am? If you wake up at the same time every night, it could be because your body is trying to send you a message. Yes, there is anecdotal evidence stating that waking up at certain times during the night is actually a symptom of something spiritual. But, according to the ancient Chinese Medicine Body Clock, energy runs through a different meridian of your body at different times of day. These meridians are like channels which send energy to different organs in order to promote health and vitality.<br /><br />When there is a blockage in these channels however, energy cannot pass through, causing stagnation or a buildup of energy. This can then disturb your sleep and wake you up. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) if you wake up at the same time every night, it could indicate a sign of weakness in the corresponding meridian or organ.<br /><br />The body, mind and emotions are inseparable in TCM - meaning that if you have disharmony in your physical body, it is tied to your emotional state. For example, if you often wake up between 3 am - 5 am, itâ€™s a sign that energies in that very corresponding part of your body are blocked and weak due to your neglect.<br /><br />In this video, we outline the organs and emotions associated with different times during the night. You will gain some insight into why you might be waking up at a certain hour and what you should do about it!<br /><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Music: Epidemic Sound<br />Visuals: VideoBlocks / Adobe Stock / Pexels / Pixabay / Other<br />Voice-over Recording, Audio &amp; Video Production by Brainy Dose<br /><br />For any copyright related queries please contact us directly at info@brainydose.com<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------{% endraw %}
