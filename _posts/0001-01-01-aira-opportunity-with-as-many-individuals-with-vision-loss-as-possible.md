{% raw %}Please help the Dayle McIntosh Center share the below AIRA opportunity with as many individuals with vision loss as possible. The only requirements are that individuals be 18 years of age, and live in the United States.<br /> <br /> You may have heard of a service called Aira, which provides people with visual disabilities access to visual information (their surroundings, signs, etc.) through the use of a cell phone's video camera. A live, trained operator is available 24/7 to provide this information in English and Spanish. Aira's website has a more<br /> Detailed description of their services. <br />The University of California, Irvine and Toyota North American Motors (TNAM) are partnering to sponsor persons with vision disabilities a free, 500 minute, a month AIRA subscription from October 2020, through August 2021. The project  has allocated funds to provide 600 AIRA subscriptions to interested individuals with visual disabilities. We have already filled 426 subscriptions of the 600 available and are seeking to provide the remaining 174 subscriptions to blind individuals who may benefit from Aira.<br /> <br />Please spread the word to your clients, members and associates. Those interested have only to complete this<br /> Google Form.<br />The form simply requests: First Name, Last Name, Email address, and Phone number. The email address is optional (to be inclusive of people who may not have one) but preferred.<br /> <br />Thank you for your support and sharing the news.{% endraw %}
