LOA provides the vocals on the main track that gives the EP its name and is full of slow, warm and deep vibes.<br /><br />Completing the EP is 'Somewhere Else' (Scott's Elsewhere Dub) with some killer dance grooves, and 'In These Stars', a sophisticated deep house anthem.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://sub-urban.es/">http://sub-urban.es/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Suburbanlabel/">https://www.facebook.com/Suburbanlabel/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sub_urban_music/">https://www.instagram.com/sub_urban_music/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/sub_urbanofficial">https://soundcloud.com/sub_urbanofficial</a>{% endraw %}
