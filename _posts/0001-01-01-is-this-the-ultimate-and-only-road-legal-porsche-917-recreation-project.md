{% raw %}Is this the ultimate (and only road legal) Porsche 917 recreation project? Think of 917s and you might think of Steve McQueen in the Le Mans film... Gulf livery, flimsy, but fast AF and a car which was basically outlawed in the 24hr for being too good. <br /><br />Well this car has been built to the exact spec of a 1969/70 917K and put through the IVA (independent vehicle approval) so as to obtain road registration. That means stuff like a glass windscreen (heated), wipers that work, mirrors that work and brakes/steering that mimic the original 917.<br /><br />There were only 25 short tail 917s made and none of those were road legal. Dave, from Icon Engineering, has designed this car to be more rigid, safer and significantly better made than an original.<br /><br />To read more about this 10-year recreation project build, and Jonny's take on it, head over and join our Patreon gang: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/TheLateBrakeShow">https://patreon.com/TheLateBrakeShow</a> <br /><br />Thanks for stopping by The Late Brake Show. <br /><br />Icon Engineering have a Facebook page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Replica917/">https://www.facebook.com/Replica917/</a><br />Instagram: icon_917K.<br /><br />Turn-key car (with 964 3.6L engine and G50 transmission) = £250K + taxes. <br />For a rolling chassis = £140K + taxes. <br /><br /><br />*********** <br />Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelatebrakeshow.com/shop">https://thelatebrakeshow.com/shop</a> <br />****** <br />Become a Patreon supporter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/TheLateBrakeShow">https://patreon.com/TheLateBrakeShow</a> <br />****** <br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thelatebrakeshow.com">http://www.thelatebrakeshow.com</a> <br />****** <br />SUBSCRIBE for a broad-church of automotive appreciation spanning EV, classic, modified and future tech. <br />****** <br />Filmed and Edited by: Phil Vaughn Pritchard <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.philvfilms.com/">https://www.philvfilms.com/</a> <br />Thumbnail by: Matt Tarrant <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.matttarrantdesign.com">https://www.matttarrantdesign.com</a><br />************<br />Jonny Smith<br />Creative content maker, car presenter &amp; car pervert for hire since '98<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.carpervert.com">http://www.carpervert.com</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/jonnycarpervert">http://www.instagram.com/jonnycarpervert</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/carpervert">http://www.twitter.com/carpervert</a><br /><br />CHAPTERS <br />0:00 Intro<br />1:12 Grand unveil<br />2:58 Where did it start?<br />3:39 25 ever made<br />5:05 The inspiration<br />5:50 Body for sale on Pistonheads<br />6:36 Flat 12 engine = €1.4 million<br />8:26 Ordering and prices<br />9:17 Bespoke cast magnesium wheels<br />9:54 CAD chassis madness<br />11:15 LIGHTNESS<br />12:12 Will Jonny fit?<br />13:16 START UP<br />13:45 ROAD DRIVING<br />15:05 Dimensions<br />19:20 Detailed walkaround<br />21:21 Engine detail &amp; specs<br />23:34 Luggage options<br />27:03 Road driving contd<br />31:53 Verdict<br /><br />#porsche917 #4k #917lemans #ultimateporsche #thelatebrakeshow{% endraw %}
