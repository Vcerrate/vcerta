{% raw %}Sergio Tito Lopez, chairman of the Brownsville Navigation District (BND) that runs the city’s port, told the Rio Grande Guardian last week that he had been in communications with the region’s two Congressmen, Reps. Filemon Vela and Vicente Gonzalez, about how to pressure the FAA to grant environmental approval for the Boca Chica site so SpaceX doesn’t up and leave.<br /><br />“We hope that does not happen,” Lopez said when asked if he was concerned that SpaceX’s rocket testing site could be moved from Boca Chica to Florida.<br /><br />“He (Musk) has come and he has invested a lot of money into our community. We are thankful for that. Of course, we are not the FAA. We do not make those decisions.”<br /><br />The first SLS rocket rolled out to its launch pad here March 17 for a countdown dress rehearsal ahead of its long-delayed launch this summer on the uncrewed Artemis 1 mission. A crawler-transporter carrying a mobile launch platform, with the SLS on it, left the Vehicle Assembly Building here at approximately 5:45 p.m. Eastern. It traveled 6.8 kilometers to Launch Complex 39B, arriving there around 4 a.m. Eastern March 18.<br /><br />_________________________________________________<br /><br />⚠️ Copyright Disclaimers<br />• We use images and content in accordance with the YouTube Fair Use copyright guidelines<br />• Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act states: “Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.” <br />• This video could contain certain copyrighted video clips, pictures, or photographs that were not specifically authorized to be used by the copyright holder(s), but which we believe in good faith are protected by federal law and the fair use doctrine for one or more of the reasons noted above.<br /><br />_____________________________________________________<br /><br />⭐ Credits:<br />Marcus House: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MarcusHouse">https://www.youtube.com/c/MarcusHouse</a><br />ErcXSpace: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ha4HFe">https://bit.ly/3ha4HFe</a><br />Smallstars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3heQgja">https://bit.ly/3heQgja</a><br />IamVisuals: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/35Z3POh">https://bit.ly/35Z3POh</a><br />SpaceXVision: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3xWTpeb">https://bit.ly/3xWTpeb</a><br />DeepSpaceCourier: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3y0hTmS">https://bit.ly/3y0hTmS</a><br />C-Bass Productions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/35Z25F0">https://bit.ly/35Z25F0</a><br />HazeGrayArt: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3hcfgHM">https://bit.ly/3hcfgHM</a><br />Jochem Laurenssen: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3vVIJuU">https://bit.ly/3vVIJuU</a><br />TijnM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3x2IWxK">https://bit.ly/3x2IWxK</a><br />AlexanderSvan: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3djK9J4">https://bit.ly/3djK9J4</a><br />NickHenning3D: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/36bsSy1">https://bit.ly/36bsSy1</a><br />EvanKaren: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3h1gmqV">https://bit.ly/3h1gmqV</a><br />StarshipBocaChica: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/starshipbocachica">https://youtube.com/c/starshipbocachica</a><br />Kimitalvitie: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/kimitalvitie">https://twitter.com/kimitalvitie</a><br />Neopork: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Neopork85">https://twitter.com/Neopork85</a><br />AlexanderSvan: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3jmOD3P">https://bit.ly/3jmOD3P</a><br />RGV Aerial Photography: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/37n1duw">https://bit.ly/37n1duw</a><br />StarshipGazer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/StarshipGazer">https://twitter.com/StarshipGazer</a><br />LabPadre: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/LabPadre">https://twitter.com/LabPadre</a><br />Spadre: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SpacePadreIsle">https://twitter.com/SpacePadreIsle</a><br />3Ddaniel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/3DDaniel1">https://twitter.com/3DDaniel1</a><br /><br />Huge thanks to all these amazing SpaceX Artists. <br />You also find their Patreon on their YouTube channels.
