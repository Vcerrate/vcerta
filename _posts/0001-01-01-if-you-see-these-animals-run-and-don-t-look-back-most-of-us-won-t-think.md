{% raw %}Most of us won't think twice about approaching an animal, taking a picture, or even picking it up if it's something small and harmless like a frog. However, you might want to change your ways as nature's got a handful of animals that may appear harmless but are, in fact, deadly. In today's video, we'll be talking about ten animals you should keep an eye out for. Make sure you watch till the end if you want to stay safe on your next safari trip.<br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ">https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ</a><br /><br />Watch our “10 Most Feared Birds In The Animal Kingdom”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EuKkYKKyRws">https://youtu.be/EuKkYKKyRws</a><br />Watch our “15 Times Animals Asked Humans For Help”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2TMi-0wB9V8">https://youtu.be/2TMi-0wB9V8</a><br />Watch our “12 Most Beautiful Horses In The World”<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/J4_8_3mHVlA">https://youtu.be/J4_8_3mHVlA</a><br /><br />Box Jellyfish <br /><br />Jellyfish seem pretty harmless. These squishy animals float in the water in mesmerizing ways that draw almost everyone. However, Box Jellyfish is a whole different story. These invisible invertebrates can be found swimming in the Indo-Pacific waters. They've got 15 tentacles that can grow up to 10 feet long. That's not all, as these tentacles are lined with cells called nematocysts, which can be called stinging cells in simpler terms. These cells are filled with toxins that can attack the nervous systems, the heart, and the skin cells all at the same time.   Human victims of the Box Jellyfish's sting have been known to die of either shock or heart failure before they even have the chance to reach the shore. There is an antivenom, but it's not much use if you can't even make it out of the water. In case you do end up getting the antivenom, you're going to experience pain for a couple of weeks and even have a nasty scar.  With that said, you might want to avoid the Philippine waters altogether since that's where these stingers end up after falling off the northern coast of Australia.<br /><br />Golden Poison Dart Frog<br /><br />Almost everyone considers frogs friendly creatures, and some might even play with them at ponds. Unfortunately, you don't want to add the Golden Poison Dart frog to that list. The golden-colored frogs can grow up to two inches - the size of a paperclip.  They may be small compared to most animals in the animal kingdom, but they pack a punch. The poison dart's skin has poison glands under its skin which secrete a toxin known as batrachotoxin all over its skin. There's enough toxin in one frog to kill over ten grown men, and all you need is a simple touch for exposure. So, if you ever find yourself in the rainforests of Columbia and come across a golden-colored frog, don't pick it up. Better yet, change your course. <br /><br /><br /><br />Follow Us On Social Media <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► For copyright issues, send us an email at: factsjunkie@gmail.com{% endraw %}
