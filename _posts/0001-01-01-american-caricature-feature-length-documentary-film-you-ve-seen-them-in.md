{% raw %}You‚Äôve seen them in magazines, in cartoons, and at just about every densely populated tourist attraction in America. A professional caricature artist will manage not only to capture a person‚Äôs likeness, but amplify it - all while exaggerating, contorting, and stylizing the subject‚Äôs most prominent features. To some, they are souvenirs. Fleeting entertainment. To others, a powerful tool in their satirical arsenal. American Caricature showcases not only the art of caricature, but the subculture surrounding it. From animators, illustrators, cartoonists, and live sketch artists, you‚Äôll hear in their own words what it is that brings them all together, both literally and figuratively. Drawing caricatures for a living is unconventional to say the least, and you‚Äôre invited to explore the the passion, the industry, and the community of caricature art in the United States. After all, drawing funny faces is a serious business!<br /><br />Directors: Joe Ciomek and Tom Faraci<br /><br />Starring: Joe Bluhm, Tom Richmond, Jason Seiler, C.F.
