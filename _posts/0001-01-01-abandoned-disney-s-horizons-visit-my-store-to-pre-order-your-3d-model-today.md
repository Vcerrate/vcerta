A year later, that attraction materialized in the form of Horizons, an omnimover ride visiting the lives of family members through their life in the future. It was nothing less than spectacular and very much beloved by many as it was everything Epcot was meant to be and encapsulated the spirt of Walt Disney himself. However just 11 year later it was closed and only operated seasonally. It was abandoned altogether in 1999 and demolished soon after to make way for Mission Space. So join me today as I find out why Disney demolished one of their best attractions ever.<br /><br />Patreon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/BrightSunFilms">https://www.patreon.com/BrightSunFilms</a><br /><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BrightSunFilms">https://twitter.com/BrightSunFilms</a><br /><br />Jake's Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BSF_Jake">https://twitter.com/BSF_Jake</a><br /><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightsunfilms">https://www.instagram.com/brightsunfilms</a><br /><br />My documentary - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.closedforstorm.com/">https://www.closedforstorm.com/</a><br /><br />--------------<br /><br />Other Interesting Horizons videos ~<br />High Quality POV - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBdglD3ziPA&amp;t=546s&amp;ab_channel=RetroWDW">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBdglD3ziPA&amp;t=546s&amp;ab_channel=RetroWDW</a><br />Hoot &amp; Chief Doc - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfh7A0lH1ac&amp;ab_channel=MatthewSerrano">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfh7A0lH1ac&amp;ab_channel=MatthewSerrano</a><br /><br />BrightSunFilms 2022<br /><br />Presented in 4K{% endraw %}
