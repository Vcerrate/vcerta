{% raw %}The 6th edition of the Marble League 2021, hosted by Crazy Cat's Eyes has 16 events where 16 marble teams will compete to win medals. Who will win this marble racing tournament?<br />This video contains all 16 events in full length including the opening and closing ceremony. <br />Thank you so much for enjoying and supporting us! <br />I (Jelle) am also happy that you have enjoyed this Marble League, however, I'm somewhat worried about the controverse caused in E9 (the DSQ), E12 Diving and the reversed starting grid in E16. Especially the reversed starting grid was a failed experiment in my opinion, I considered that because I was really tired during the production and didn't like to do a time consuming qualifying round in E16, but I regret this now.<br />#marblerace #marbleleague #jellesmarbleruns #marblelympics #marblerun #marbles #marblesports #marbleasmr<br /><br />0:00 Opening Ceremony <br />2:42 E1 - Wave<br />10:48 E2 - Balancing<br />18:43 E3 - 5 Meter Sprint<br />24:56 E4 - Funnel Endurance <br />37:03 E5 - 5 Meter Relay<br />43:53 E6 - Jousting <br />55:35 E7 - 5 Meter Hurdles <br />1:02:49 E8 - Block Pushing<br />1:16:12 E9 - Triathlon <br />1:25:59 E10 - Steeplechase <br />1:35:59 E11 - Sand Mogul Race<br />1:42:38 E12 - Diving<br />1:52:18 E13 - Elimination Race<br />2:05:30 E14 - Sand Rally<br />2:14:30 E15 - Football/Soccer<br />2:30:15 E16 - Marblocross <br />2:41:58 Closing Ceremony<br />2:44:30 Credits<br />2:46:21 2022 Host Reveal<br /><br />=== NEW MERCH ===<br /><br />Check out the new Marble Team Lapel Pins!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/nl/stores/jelles">https://teespring.com/nl/stores/jelles</a><br /><br />===JMR SOUNDTRACK===<br /><br />Subscribe today to Minos Marble Orchestra to listen to all the JMR soundtracks!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChEOtcuPOP-FWvrjOXxGxdA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChEOtcuPOP-FWvrjOXxGxdA</a><br /><br />=== JMR THE GAME === <br /><br />Jelle's Marble League Game out now under Early Access on Steam: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1772480/Jelles_Marble_League/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1772480/Jelles_Marble_League/</a><br /><br />=== Useful Links: ===<br /><br />Please support Jelle’s Marble Runs: <br /><br />Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Jelles">https://www.patreon.com/Jelles</a><br /><br />Official JMR merchandise: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/nl/stores/jelles">https://teespring.com/nl/stores/jelles</a><br /><br />=== Credits: ===<br /><br />Commentary: Greg Woods<br />Music: Minos Fylaktos<br />Filming / Video Editing: Kars van Weerde<br />Various: Jelle’s Marble Association<br />Fan Cheering Chants: Time Check<br />Graphics: Kaiden Keiser<br />Full credits are shown at 2:44:30<br /><br />=== Social media: ===<br /><br />Instagram: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jellesmarbles/">https://www.instagram.com/jellesmarbles/</a><br /><br />Facebook: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/jelleknikkers/">https://www.facebook.com/jelleknikkers/</a><br /><br />Twitter: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Jellesmarbles">https://twitter.com/Jellesmarbles</a><br /><br />=== Other links: ===<br /><br />Subreddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JellesMarbleRuns/">https://www.reddit.com/r/JellesMarbleRuns/</a><br /><br />Wiki: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jellesmarbleruns.fandom.com">https://jellesmarbleruns.fandom.com</a><br /><br />© Jelle's Marble Runs 2021: Please do NOT copy and reupload this video without our permission{% endraw %}
