{% raw %}Vampiric Grip can be used as a human, without mods, through a glitch.<br />Here is a link to a video explaining how to do so:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA20XEVSx44&amp;t=187s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA20XEVSx44&amp;t=187s</a><br />The strategy may need to be modified on PC and higher level consoles, by actually activating Bound Sword in the left hand, doing a power attack with it, and then immediately activating vampire lord form.<br />The rooftop of Dragonsreach can be accessed by careful climbing.<br />I drank a potion of invisibility while in sneak mode, to remain undetected to Nazeem, which also allowed me to steal his clothes.  Ragdolling an NPC guarantees a 100% success rate with pickpocket.{% endraw %}
