{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://maketodaygreat.com">http://maketodaygreat.com</a> Imagine the day of your death. ðŸ’€ Then imagine you coming back to NOW and having a countdown timer constantly clicking each second, minute, hour, and day getting you closer each moment to you not being here any longer. Would you lallygag around in fear or would you push yourself with urgency to create more memorable moments? I choose the latter, and would encourage you to consider doing the same. Make Today Great!
