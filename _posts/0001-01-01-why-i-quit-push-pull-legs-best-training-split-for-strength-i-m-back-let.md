{% raw %}I'm back!

I squat, bench press, and deadlift to go from skinny to muscular. Is it the best training split for muscle gains? This is how I increased my squat strength and how I increased my bench press strength.<br /><br />Push Pull Legs | Best Training Split | Workout Split for Gains{% endraw %}
