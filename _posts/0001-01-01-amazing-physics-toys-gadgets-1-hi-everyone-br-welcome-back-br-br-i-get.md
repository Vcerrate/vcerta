{% raw %}Hi Everyone :)<br />Welcome back! <br /><br />I get asked often: &quot;Where did you get all this stuff?&quot; My goal is to share the real magic of science and physics- and to this end I will update here (and in my store) suggestions on where to get some of these toys, kinetic art pieces, and scientific curiosities for yourself. <br />Purchasing items from the links on these pages will help support my IG page of science and wonder. <br /><br />Buy physicsfun toys on : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2MOjFET">https://bit.ly/2MOjFET</a> (Official websit 🇺🇸) <br /><br />physicsfun toys on amazon :<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/36RRxt0">https://amzn.to/36RRxt0</a><br /><br />Follow on Instagram : <br /><br /><br />This video contains :<br />👉🏻 Ambiguous Object Illusion: repost of this incredible design by Kokichi Sugihara of Meiji University in Japan, the inventor of this illusion and art form. <br /><br />👉🏻 Perpetual Motion Simulator: this marble machine device does not break any laws of thermodynamics- but it sure looks like it! When I first saw videos of this piece of kinetic art I thought the effect was due to video editing, but in fact the base contains a power source and very clever mechanism (swipe twice for clue/partial reveal). An amazing piece of art by William Le crafted from stainless steel wire, doussie hardwood, and undisclosed internal components. A remarkable addition to my collection! <br /><br />👉🏻 Monochromatic Room @exploratorium: a photo of colorful San Francisco is illuminated by a very narrow frequency band of light, with a wavelength of 589nm- the characteristic spectrum of sodium vapor lamps at low pressure.<br /><br />👉🏻 Copycoder: clever use of an array of cylindrical lenses to scramble and unscramble large font messages- a modern &quot;secret code&quot; toy.<br /><br />👉🏻 Vortex Marble: glass art intersects with the physics of optics in this lampwork art form invented by Kevin O’Grady circa 1994- and this marble bears his signature mark on the back.<br /><br />👉🏻 Scale Solar System<br /><br />👉🏻 Scale Solar System Sticker Set: one of the most amazing facts about the planets in our solar system is their relative sizes. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and dwarf planet Pluto included for comparison- all in their current order (sometimes Pluto is closer than Neptune), and mounted here on a sheet of polycarbonate. On this scale, Neptune would be about 5 kilometers away from Mercury! <br /><br />👉🏻 Moondrop: using magnets and Lenz's Law to imitate free fall times on the Moon and Mars.<br /><br />👉🏻 Plasma Arc Lighter Physics: dual arcs of plasma exceed 1100 C (2000 F) on this flameless lighter. <br /><br />👉🏻 Halloween Neon Glow Bulb: the pumpkins, with a high voltage between them, glow orange with light from the emission spectrum of the excited neon atoms of the low pressure gas within the bulb.<br /><br />👉🏻 Uranium Metal: at Z=92 protons, uranium is the largest naturally occurring atom one can extract from the Earth. <br /><br />👉🏻 Oil Drop Timer: immiscible liquids (colored oil in kerosine) in two connected containers. The oil in each container falls through a small drop forming hole in between clear walls of acrylic.<br /><br />Background music by : YouTube Audio Library<br />1) Forever - Anno Domini Beats <br />2) Cosmic Drift - DivKid<br />3) Lulu - Underbelly <br />4) Book The Rental Wit It - rage<br />5) Vital Whales - Unicorn Heads{% endraw %}
