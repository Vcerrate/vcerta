{% raw %}In this week's episode, I am joined by Forward Guidance's Jack Farley &amp; Joseph Wang for a surprise cross-over (that we all knew was coming eventually ;)  We missed Mark unfortunately who is away skiing, but he was with us in spirit and wore his bitcoin bull market socks in solidarity. We'll get em next week Mark!<br /><br />We kicked things off with a deep dive into the record 7.5% CPI print.  We took a look at what the driving components were, headline vs core, and much more.  We also questioned how much of inflation was due to the Fed (demand side) vs the supply side (supply chain disruptions) and how effective rate hikes would be in tamping down inflation.<br /><br />Next, we dove deep into the topic of yield curve inversion and got Joseph's opinion on the link between an inverted curve and a recession.  We also covered Joseph's framework for how the world changed post great financial crisis, and how banking regulations may impact how trustworthy a signal the long end of the curve is.<br /><br />Finally, we closed with Joseph's high-level thoughts on where the market is headed in 2022.  For that, you'll have to tune into the show.<br />--<br />Follow Jack Farley: @JackFarley96<br />Follow Joseph Wang: @FedGuy12<br />Follow Mike: @MikeIppolito_<br />Follow Blockworks: @Blockworks_<br />--<br />Listen to this episode on Apple or Spotify.<br />Apple: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/mry8y4k3">https://tinyurl.com/mry8y4k3</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/3vnnkrkw">https://tinyurl.com/3vnnkrkw</a><br />--<br />Fireblocks is an enterprise-grade platform delivering a secure infrastructure for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets.
