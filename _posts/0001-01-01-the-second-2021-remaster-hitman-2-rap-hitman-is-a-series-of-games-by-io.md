{% raw %}Hitman is a series of games by IO interactive that follows the life of international master assassin, the mysterious Agent 47, as he is contracted by the I.C.A. to take out high profile (usually criminal) targets around the globe... Wait... Haven't I said this before?<br /><br />Happy new year everyone! I'm busy working on a whole bunch of big projects for the channel this year. There's some really exciting stuff in the works! So I decided to focus January on working on some of the larger projects for Feb/March instead of making a new song. Taking this month to relax and get all the planning and pre-production done for the next couple of months has been a huge relief on my mental health and means you'll get more new videos quicker when it's time to start making them!<br /><br />Instead I decided, in honour of Hitman 3's release, to revisit my Hitman 2 song. I always loved this song lyrically but it's one of many earlier songs on this channel made before I was working with a professional music producer and I always hated how it sounded. So what better time to have it remastered?<br /><br />I'm so happy with how this new version sounds vs. the old one and I'm keen to give other older songs the remaster treatment. If this is something you'd like to see then let me know in the comments!<br /><br />Thanks to oo oxygen for his work making this track shine!<br /><br />#Hitman #Hitman3 #Agent47<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Check out the full Stupendium originals playlist for all of my original songs!<br /><br />STUPENDIUM ORIGINALS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVVOXbE6Ls1glsfzH9tldq-KqPI-g84LA">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVVOXbE6Ls1glsfzH9tldq-KqPI-g84LA</a><br /><br />THE STUPENDIUM ON SPOTIFY:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Stupendify">http://bit.ly/Stupendify</a><br /><br />THE STUPENDIUM ON iTUNES:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/StupendiTunes">http://bit.ly/StupendiTunes</a><br /><br />Lyrics, Vocals and Video by The Stupendium<br />Instrumental by Sinima Beats<br />Mixing and mastering by oo oxygen:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/OxygenBeats">https://www.youtube.com/user/OxygenBeats</a><br />Hitman, Agent 47 and the trailer and gameplay footage used here are property of the wonderful IO Interactive!<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Grab your official Stupendium Merchandise!
