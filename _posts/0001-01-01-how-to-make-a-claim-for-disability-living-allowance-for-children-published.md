They can get a DLA for children claim form by either going to www.gov.uk/disability-living-allowance-children/how-to-claim and printing it off. Or they can call the Disability Living Allowance helpline on 0800 121 4600 and a form will send to them.<br /><br />Can they get the form in an alternative format?<br /><br />Yes, if they need the form in an alternative format, such as braille, large print or audio CD they can call the Disability Living Allowance helpline on 0800 121 4600.  <br />If they cannot hear or speak on the phone they can use Relay UK by dialling 18001 then 0800 121 4600. <br />British Sign Language users can use the Video Relay Service. <br />For more information about this go to www.gov.uk/disability-living-allowance-children/how-to-claim <br /><br />What information should they give on the claim form?<br /><br />Before they complete the claim form they should read the information notes. <br />The notes give help and advice about DLA. They also explain the questions in the claim form and give help on what information is needed.<br /><br />When should they send the form back?<br /><br />You should complete the form and try to send it back to us as soon as they can.<br />If we can award a child DLA it could be paid from the date we get the form back or the date they called the helpline to ask for the claim form. This is as long as the claim form is returned within 6 weeks and the child is entitled to get DLA.<br />They could lose out on money if they wait to return the form.<br /><br />What information does the claim form ask for?<br /><br />The DLA claim form asks for information about what help the child needs with their mobility or care. <br />It’s really helpful if they supply as much information as they can and if they have any supporting medical evidence such as prescription lists, medical reports, speech and language assessments, psychological reports, Educational and Health Care Plans (EHCP) or a Statement of Educational Needs, that they send copies of these with the claim form. They should not send originals as we unable to return these to them.<br />They do not need to send us appointment letters or general information about the child’s condition or medication. <br />If they are waiting for a diagnosis or supporting medical evidence and reports, they should return the claim form to us with consent details completed and write on the form that they will be sending further information.<br /><br />Can you tell me what they should do if their child is terminally ill?<br /><br />There are ‘special rules’ if the child is terminally ill, so the child can get DLA more quickly.<br />If the child is terminally ill they should call the Disability Living Allowance helpline on 0800 121 4600 to start the claim<br />They should also ask a doctor or other healthcare professional for a form called DS1500. <br />The doctor will either fill it in and give the form to them to send to us or the doctor will send it directly to us. <br />For more information about ‘special rules’ go to www.gov.uk/terminal-illness-benefits<br /><br /><br />For a DLA claim form go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/disability-living-allowance-children/how-to-claim">https://www.gov.uk/disability-living-allowance-children/how-to-claim</a>{% endraw %}
