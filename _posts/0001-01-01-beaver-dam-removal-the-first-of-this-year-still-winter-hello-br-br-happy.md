{% raw %}Hello,<br /><br />Happy to come back to do my job! Some plants around most likely will die due to wet conditions. The small forest nearby also going down. In fields still there are a lot of water. I must wait until rainy season ends. Then i can lower the dam till lowest level.<br /><br />ðŸ‘•  If you want to support my channel check out my new Merch store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Kenislovas">https://bit.ly/Kenislovas</a>{% endraw %}
