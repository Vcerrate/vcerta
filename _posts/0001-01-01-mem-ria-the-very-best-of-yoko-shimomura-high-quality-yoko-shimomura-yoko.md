{% raw %}Yoko Shimomura, a Japanese composer and pianist, is best known for her work composing for video game titles such as the Kingdom Hearts series, the Mana series, Xenoblade, and Final Fantasy XV. I will not eleborate too much on the album itself. From its delicate piano arrangments to its heavy synths and full orcestrations, Memoria speaks to Yoko's legacy through the only fitting medium: Music. Enjoy~<br /><br />Arranged by: Sachiko Miyano, Hiroyuki Nakayama, &amp; Natsumi Kameoka<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br />00:00:05 - Dearly Beloved<br />00:03:36 - Beware The Forest's Mushrooms<br />00:07:01 - Kiss of Jealousy<br />00:09:34 - The Revolving Wheel of Fate<br />00:14:29 - Elegie<br />00:18:43 - Vector to the Heavens<br />00:24:31 - Going Through the Flame ~Seiken Densetsu Legend of MANA Dragon Killer Medley~<br />00:30:33 - A.Y.A.<br />00:33:41 - Pain in the Universe<br />00:36:56 - MEGALOMANIA<br />00:40:12 - Song of Mana ~Orchestral Version~<br />00:45:46 - Goodbye Geno... ~ Seeking Dreams Through the Window of the Stars<br />00:50:17 - OMNIS LACRIMA<br />00:54:45 - The Masked<br />00:58:04 - Kiss of Jealousy (Karoake)<br />01:00:37 - MEGALOMANIA (Karaoke)<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -{% endraw %}
