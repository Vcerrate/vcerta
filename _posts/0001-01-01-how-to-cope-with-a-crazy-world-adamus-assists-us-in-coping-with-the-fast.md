He has great understanding and empathy for the human journey. His human background and experiences – as well as his ascension from the human condition – give him unique insights and compassion when he’s guiding us into our Realization, in a way no alien or galactic being can do.<br />He’s the Captain of this spiritual pirate ship, guiding us through stormy waters onward to Enlightenment Island.{% endraw %}
