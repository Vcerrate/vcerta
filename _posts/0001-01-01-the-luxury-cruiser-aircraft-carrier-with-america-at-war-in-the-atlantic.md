{% raw %}With America at war in the Atlantic and the Pacific, one aircraft carrier firmly stood out from the rest. It was USS Wolverine, one of the oddest ships in United States Navy history. <br /><br />Initially built and used as a luxury cruiser on the Great Lakes, the side-wheel steamer had a second life during World War 2, when she was fitted with a flight deck that was much closer to the water than what was used at the time.<br /><br />Still, the US Navy was in dire need of a larger carrier force and bought the ship in 1942 to confront the incessant Japanese aggression.<br /><br />Even if the authentic flattop was unfit for combat and had only sailed in freshwater, Commander Richard F. Whitehead had a unique idea that would have USS Wolverine play a crucial role in military history as part of a fundamental operation in the effort against the Axis powers.{% endraw %}
