{% raw %}My conclusion is this.<br /><br />A video has been released that confirms why I continue to value delay. <br /><br />Thanks to Momo0 for the help.  Before moving on to the main subject, <br /><br />I will explain the technology called dil.  <br /><br />Delay is a way to solve the lag caused by the ping caused by the distance between ip regulations and other countries.  <br /><br />1. The other person's nationality <br />2. The other person's ping state <br />3. The other person's Internet speed.  <br /><br />However, it is very difficult to find all of them.  So the simple way to find it is simple.  <br /><br />Predict the opponent's movement and attack.  <br /><br />If he was hit, he would die or use healing skills.  <br /><br />In this way, each player memorizes how many seconds the delay takes.  <br /><br />In short, this is because the low ping is not a lag, just because it is different from the <br />nationality of the server computer. <br /><br />You can see this video now.  <br /><br />This game is more advantageous depending on the number of pings in the ping bar and can make the game more comfortable.  <br /><br />Conversely, if your ping is low, your attack will be removed by that amount and it will not reach your opponent.  <br /><br />If you have more questions, please leave a comment.  <br /><br />Thanks for reading the long article.<br /><br />with BARISTAR amd Momo0{% endraw %}
