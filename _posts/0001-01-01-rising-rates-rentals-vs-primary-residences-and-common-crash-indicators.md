{% raw %}If a housing bubble is on the horizon, how best do real estate investors prepare for the massive hit they’re about to take? With so much money flowing throughout the economy, home prices hitting record highs, and competition staying fierce, what can the average investor do to stock up so when a housing market crash does happen, they’re ready to make big moves? David Greene, may have an answer. <br /><br />Although many people see David as a real estate fortune teller, he, unfortunately does not bring his crystal ball (unless you count his shiny bald head) onto today’s coaching call episode. Lucky for us, he does bring over a decade worth of knowledge from investing in many different phases of the real estate cycle. David is thrown questions from live guests today, without any preparation or information besides his own knowledge.<br /><br />Topics on today’s show range from when to buy a primary residence vs. buying a rental property, outsourcing your tasks so you can grow your portfolio, what will happen when interest rates rise this year, housing bubble indicators, and finding honest contractors. If you’re looking to invest in real estate, whether this year or within the next decade, David’s thoughts on surviving and thriving in a housing crash could make you much, much wealthier!<br /><br />~~~~<br />Join BiggerPockets for FREE: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/signup?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/signup?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />~~~~<br />Sign Up for BiggerPockets Pro: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/membership-types?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/membership-types?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a><br />~~~~<br />Ask David a Question:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/david?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/david?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />~~~~<br />Join the Next Live Q&amp;A Episode:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/livequestions?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/livequestions?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />~~~~<br />Will Rising Interest Rates Tank the Housing Market?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/will-rising-interest-rates-tank-the-housing-market?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/will-rising-interest-rates-tank-the-housing-market?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />~~~~<br />The Four Stages of the Real Estate Cycle — And What to Buy When for Stellar Returns: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/real-estate-cycle?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/real-estate-cycle?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />~~~~<br />Connect with David on BiggerPockets:<br />David: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/davidgreene24?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/davidgreene24?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a><br />~~~~<br />Follow BiggerPockets and David on Instagram:<br />BiggerPockets: @biggerpockets or <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/biggerpockets/">https://www.instagram.com/biggerpockets/</a> <br />David: @davidgreene24 or <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/davidgreene24/">https://www.instagram.com/davidgreene24/</a> <br /><br /><br />Episode #574<br />0:00 Intro<br />1:36 Quick Tip <br />2:20 Buying a Primary Residence vs. Investment Property<br />7:32 Bridge Loans and Financing a New Rental Property <br />15:00 &quot;Who Not How&quot; and Outsourcing Tasks<br />24:21 Housing Crash Hysteria<br />31:58 How to Foresee a Housing Crash<br />37:31 zWhat Happens When Interest Rates Rise? <br />42:17 Leading Indicators of a Housing Market Crash<br />50:08 How to Find Honest Contractors<br />54:13 Ask David Your Real Estate Questions!<br /><br />Show notes at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/show574?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/show574?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a>{% endraw %}
