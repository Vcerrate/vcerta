Our mission is to advance knowledge; to educate students in science, engineering, and technology; and to tackle the most pressing problems facing the world today. We are a community of hands-on problem-solvers in love with fundamental science and eager to make the world a better place.<br /> <br />The MIT YouTube channel features videos about all types of MIT research, including the robot cheetah, LIGO, gravitational waves, mathematics, and bombardier beetles, as well as videos on origami, time capsules, and other aspects of life and culture on the MIT campus. Our goal is to open the doors of MIT and bring the Institute to the world through video.<br /><br />Video: Melanie Gonick/MIT<br />3-D printing footage and experiment simulation: Gang Seob Jung/Zhao Qin<br />Graphene animation: Pond5/edited by Melanie Gonick{% endraw %}
