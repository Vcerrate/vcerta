{% raw %}What happened to our big brains in America?<br /><br />If you Google which countries are the smartest on earth, you’ll get various levels of we’re not the best and brightest, but overall, most indices indicate the good ole USA is in the lower upper tier when it comes to our education levels. We’re not in the top ten for average IQ though, apparently.<br /><br />But there are some rankings where we win the brain battle. 7 in 10 of our high school graduates go on to college. We have 8 of the 10 best ranked universities in the world within our borders. Our schools are regularly ranked as the best in the world, although our students don’t always reflect that.<br /> <br />But there are lots of signs that our bulbs might be getting a little less dim if you know what I mean. We’re going to talk about that and what the implications might be. And I’ll explain it on a really simple level. That way you can follow along. Dummy.<br /><br />Dr. Paul Cleveland's website: www.boundarystone.org<br /><br />You could read all sorts of stuff online about why this is happening, but most of the stuff I was able to find all had a similar theme. We’ve dumbed down our kids. Our school books used to be filled with text and are now filled with pictures. Kids are being taught to learn standards and theories and how to pass tests. And there’s less accountability for our students. Administrations just insist on pushing kids through our school systems these days.<br /><br />A big part of the decline in our intelligence is our environment. We’re distracted by dumb TV shows, angry music and biased news. And our nutrition has gone down the tubes. Too much fat and sugar doesn’t just affect your weight, people. <br /><br />A lot of experts say our public schools are failing and have failed to keep up with the times. Our public schools are funded by taxes, but they are often underfunded. Classrooms are crowded and teachers are underpaid. They get low wages and they’re asked to do more for less compensation these days. New teachers make about 25% less than the average recent college graduate. Why would anyone want to become a teacher anymore when they are underpaid and underappreciated?<br /><br />They asked parents - would you want your child to become a teacher one day? And for the first time since the early 80s, less than half of parents said they’d want their children to become teachers one day. School districts used to get 100 applications for teacher openings. Now, they’re lucky to get 5. That’s some scary stuff. <br /><br />Our schools aren’t terrible, but the teachers are having a hard time. Every single day in every single school there’s a teacher shortage. Our classes are left unmonitored, or combined with others into large groups of unglorified study halls. <br /><br />Email me: Robikmarketing1@gmail.com<br /><br />I have a Patreon if you love it so much!
