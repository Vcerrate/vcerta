{% raw %}If you've ever wondered how Keurig's &quot;Over Ice&quot; button works then this video is for you. Using the K-Supreme I demonstrate how the button works and how to brew iced coffee from a Keurig.<br /><br />Many of the high end Keurig machines offer this button and they all work similarly.<br /><br />♦♦♦♦<br />BTW, I personally own every modern Keurig sold in stores and I help customers understand the differences between them all to the best of my ability. You can see the current list of Keurig brewers that I recommend to people on this page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.topoffmycoffee.com/best-keurig-coffee-maker/">https://www.topoffmycoffee.com/best-keurig-coffee-maker/</a><br />♦♦♦♦<br /><br />You may also be interested in checking out the newest Keurig, the K-Supreme Plus SMART - it has an iced coffee button and a bunch of other bells and whistles. You can see my comparison of it to the older K-Supreme Plus here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.topoffmycoffee.com/k-supreme-plus-vs-smart/">https://www.topoffmycoffee.com/k-supreme-plus-vs-smart/</a>{% endraw %}
