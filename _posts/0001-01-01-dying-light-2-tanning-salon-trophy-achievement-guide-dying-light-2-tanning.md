[Bronze]<br /><br />The UV Flashlight is unlocked automatically from the story in the 14th Main Quest “Welcome On Board”. This is quite late in the game so you must play through most of the story first.<br /><br />Once you have it, Hold LEFT to open equipment wheel to assign UV Flashlight to quick slot, hold R2/RT to use it.<br /><br />Go find any of the normal slow zombies that walk around in the streets at day (trophy wouldn't unlock at night for me for some reason). Virals are the most common, slowest form of infected, found everywhere in the streets. Shine the UV flashlight at one of them, then perform a melee-attack to kill the Viral while it is stunned from the UV light.<br /><br />If it doesn't unlock at night, try at day.
