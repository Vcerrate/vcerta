We are a young couple who started their Canadian Immigration journey in 2018 and moved to Canada 3 days before the pandemic hit in March 2020. Over the course of our application, we have seen so many people getting screwed over by greedy / fraudulent and unauthorized immigration consultants who promise you the world in exchange for thousands of dollars and deliver a whole lot of NOTHING; to an extent that in many cases, the applications get rejected, due to their negligence. <br /><br />Therefore, we are taking matters in our own hands. After months of research and our own experience of applying for a Canadian PR, we came up with an e-book series &amp; this YouTube channel which would include - errors to avoid, perfect sample documents (my own) and alternate ways of immigrating to Canada - 100 pages of absolute goldmine between these 3 e-books - no filters, no premium versions to these ebooks... everything is out there FOR FREE, for you to read and execute the process yourself! All we are doing in these ebooks is sharing our experience of applying for PR ourselves / structuring and pointing you in the right direction via various different resources that are available on IRCC's official website. The YouTube channel will compliment the e-book and add some personality and entertainment to the entire process :-)<br /><br />Volume 1: Step by step express entry process from know nothing about immigration all the way to getting an invitation to apply (ECA, IELTS etc).
