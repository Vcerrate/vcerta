VIPER (Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover) is a lunar rover developed by NASA (Ames Research Center) that is currently due to be delivered to the lunar surface in November 2023.<br /><br />The lunar region of the South Pole as a whole will be busy with missions to Noble Crater in 2023, as well as Shackleton Crater (near the IM-2 landing site). The moon is already well mapped thanks to past NASA missions such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.<br /><br />Data from Luna 24, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Indian Chandrayaan 1 Orbiter, and the Lunar Crater Observation and Sounding Satellite showed that lunar water is widely (albeit slightly) distributed over the lunar surface, especially at constant shaded craters in the region of the South Pole. In 2009, NASA followed up the discovery with the Lunar Crater Observation and Sounding Satellite (LCROSS), which crashed into the Moon and further confirmed water ice. Data from NASA's SOFIA observatory helped find real molecular water on the moon's solar surfaces. In one study, researchers found water right on the lunar surface by finding the molecule in sunlit areas of the moon.<br /><br />NASA's orbital missions have shown that there is water ice on the moon, especially in the deep, permanent shadows of some mountains and craters. For years, scientists believed that ice craters at the lunar poles contained water ice, both a scientific advantage and a potential resource for human missions. Observations from India's Chandrayaan-1 probe in 2008 and NASA's LCROSS mission in 2009 indicated that the moon's south pole region contains water ice, which was detected in emissions from the planned Centaurus constellation. The rocket crashed in a permanently shadowed crater at the moon's south pole. In support of the presentation, NASA has also been very vocal about mining water ice on the moon.<br /><br />At the end of 2023, NASA plans to send a rover called Viper to the Moon, which will map the location of water ice on the lunar surface and collect samples. NASA's first mobile robotic mission to the Moon, VIPER, will carry a TRIDENT drill and scientific instruments that will directly analyze water ice on and below the surface of the Moon at different depths and under different temperature conditions. NASA believes the VIPER rover will help create the first global maps of the Moon's water resources. Even before the shipment happens, private company Intuitive Machines plans to send a robotic lander to the lunar surface in 2022, equipped with the same drill Viper will use.<br /><br />On Monday, NASA announced that in 2023 a golf cart-sized VIPER will land near the western rim of Nobile Crater on the Moon's south pole, at the moon's south pole. The water-hunting Viper rover will travel alongside space robotics company Astrobotics Griffin, which will accompany the rover to the surface.
