A varied roster of stars of the past such as Jerry Lawler, Hulk Hogan, The Von Erichs, Bret Hart, Terry Funk and The Road Warriors would battle it out using an updated version of Acclaim's wrestling engine, and the single player experience would allow fans to visit different cities across America to win regional championships. The game sounded like a dream come true for many old school fans, the grapple system was also noteworthy for implementing a combo system quite well, but the overall experience falls short and we end up with another wrestling game that falls short when compared to other offerings.<br /><br />#Wrestling #retrogaming{% endraw %}
