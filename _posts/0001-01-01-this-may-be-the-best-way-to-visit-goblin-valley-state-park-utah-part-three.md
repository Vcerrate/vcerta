{% raw %}UTAH PART THREE: Sometimes you just gotta improvise on the fly. In this short episode, weather &amp; lighting conditions prompt me to alter my approach to visiting Goblin Valley, ultimately resulting in a better experience than if I had stuck with my original plans.  <br /><br />I realize this video is pretty short for an installment in a weeklong adventure series, but I wanted this to just focus on Goblin Valley in order for it to also be potentially useful for anyone researching their visit to this unique geological feature.<br /><br />If you'd like to see more epic driving through stunning central Utah scenery, you can hop over to Backroad Exploration where you'll find a full episode that features me along with Jared &amp; Mike of Backroad Exploration: <br /><br />Note that I will NOT be making an episode about this part of my Utah adventure, so the only way to see what was arguably my most epic drive of the trip is to watch Jared's excellent videos of our excursion together.<br /><br /> If you haven't already, be sure to check out the first two episodes in my series:<br />UTAH PART ONE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/fr3EJ1PHBx4">https://youtu.be/fr3EJ1PHBx4</a><br />UTAH PART TWO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rNWJl7C2OIY">https://youtu.be/rNWJl7C2OIY</a><br /><br />If you enjoy my work and would like to support the ongoing creation of these videos, consider joining my Patreon page with a small monthly contribution.
