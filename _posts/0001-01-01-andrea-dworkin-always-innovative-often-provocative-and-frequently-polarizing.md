{% raw %}Dworkin began writing poetry and fiction in the sixth grade. Around that time, she was undecided about whether to become a lawyer or a writer and chose writing because she could &quot;do it in a room alone&quot; and &quot;nobody could stop me&quot;. Throughout high school, she read avidly, with encouragement from her parents. She was particularly influenced by Arthur Rimbaud, Charles Baudelaire, Henry Miller, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Che Guevara, and the Beat poets, especially Allen Ginsberg, and has included among writers she &quot;admired most&quot; Genet, Shelley, and Byron.<br /><br />In 2002, Dworkin published her autobiography, Heartbreak: The Political Memoir of a Feminist Militant. She soon began to speak and write again, and in an interview with Julie Bindel in 2004 said, &quot;I thought I was finished, but I feel a new vitality. I want to continue to help women.&quot;[52] She published three more articles in the Guardian and began work on a new book, Writing America: How Novelists Invented and Gendered a Nation, on the role of novelists such as Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner in the development of American political and cultural identity, which was left unfinished when she died.<br /><br />Her analysis and writing influenced and inspired the work of contemporary feminists, such as Catharine MacKinnon, Gloria Steinem, John Stoltenberg, Nikki Craft, Susan Cole, and Amy Elman.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Dworkin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Dworkin</a><br /><br />Image By Open Media Ltd (Open Media Ltd) [CC BY-SA 3.0 (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)],">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)],</a> via Wikimedia Commons{% endraw %}
