{% raw %}Everyone hates math, right? Wrong! I like math. Mathematicians like math, presumably. Physicists like math, usually. People who hate math just don't understand it. But like that weird ethnic food you're scared of trying, or that odd kid in class that doesn't say much, if you come to understand something it's not so scary. In fact, if we can learn enough about math, we will come to love it, because there is so much we can do with it. Watch this series to supplement your math classes, or just to learn enough math that you can become friends. It starts out super easy so don't be afraid!
