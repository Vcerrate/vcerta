I met him a few months ago on a bench at Balboa Park. Since then every time he sees me filming he asks about my question for the day.. we typically talk for 30 minutes discussing the question and so much more. Recently, he came up to me and said that he had an interesting question for me to ask strangers.. and this was it. He said that his answer would be- when he found out on average there are 12 dead spiders in a jar of peanut butter. He wishes he never heard that because he love peanut butter!!<br /><br />I hope you all enjoy this episode! I love you guys!! #BeKind<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/thorayamaronesy">https://www.youtube.com/thorayamaronesy</a><br /><br />follow me on:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/thor.aya">http://instagram.com/thor.aya</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Thoraya-1165...">https://www.facebook.com/Thoraya-1165...</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/thorayaaa">https://twitter.com/thorayaaa</a><br /><br />Business inquiries: management@thoraya.com<br />Other inquiries: thorayaproject@gmail.com<br /><br />I love meeting new people in real life but I would love to hear your story as well... so feel free to send me a letter!
