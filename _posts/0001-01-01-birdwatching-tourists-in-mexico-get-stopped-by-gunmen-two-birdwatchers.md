{% raw %}Two birdwatchers expected a quiet vacation taking photos of tropical wildlife, so nothing prepared them for the nightmare they experienced in Mexico. Aaron Payzant and Logan Howard were driving from Indiana to Cancun. They were on a back road looking for birds to photograph when out of nowhere, a truck raced past, and gunmen lept out and approached the car. Luckily for the Americans, the gunmen reassured them that they werenâ€™t in danger, but warned them not to go further down the road.{% endraw %}
