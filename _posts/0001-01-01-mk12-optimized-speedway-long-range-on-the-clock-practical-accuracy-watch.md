We think these improvements make it even more lethal... and it shows on the time. <br /><br />Consider supporting us via Patreon üëâ  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/9HoleReviews">http://www.patreon.com/9HoleReviews</a> (you an also access the Practical Accuracy Scoreboard here)<br /><br />Observer setup seen here powered by: <br />- Vortex Optics Razor HD Spotting Scope 27-60x85 Angled<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2M3zTGP">https://amzn.to/2M3zTGP</a><br />- Vortex Optics Pro GT Tripod<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2X7j6sL">https://amzn.to/2X7j6sL</a><br />- Phone Skope Lollipop Universal Digiscoping kit<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZK50zk">https://amzn.to/2ZK50zk</a><br /><br />We have a discount for Slate Black Industries MLOK accessories! <br />üëâ www (dot) slateblackindustries (dot) com <br />Discount code: 9HOLE<br /><br />Shopping with this link costs you nothing, but provides us with equipment: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/?tag=sbi09-20">https://www.amazon.com/?tag=sbi09-20</a><br /><br />This video's editing by Agency Communications LLC<br />Music by Tyops (THANKS!!!)<br /><br />__________________________________________________________________<br />We love mail:<br />9 Hole Reviews<br />21175 Tomball Pkwy.
