{% raw %}The Michael Bell-trained Motivator maintained his unbeaten record as he beat The Geezer in the 10-furlong Dante Stakes in 2007, with Aidan O'Brien's second string Falstaff third, after making the early running.<br /><br />Owned by the Royal Ascot Racing Club, Motivator was a son of Montjeu who went on to win the Epsom Derby the following month and then finished second in the Eclipse and the Irish Champion Stakes.<br /><br />Winning rider Johnny Murtagh said after this contest: &quot;It was a funny race. There wasn't much pace but when I asked him to quicken he did it very well. I think he'll come round Tattenham Corner come Derby day. He was only having his third run and I expect a lot more improvement - he has what it takes.<br /><br />&quot;Good horses adapt and to win the Derby he has to overcome it all. I think he has a great chance.&quot;<br /><br />He was right!<br /><br />#HorseRacing #YorkRaces #Dante #Horses<br /><br />This is the official YouTube channel of Racing TV.<br /> <br />Racing TV is the UK's leading horse racing channel showing live racing from the best racecourses in Great Britain and Ireland.<br /> <br />Subscribe to Racing TV's free YouTube channel and get closer to the sport we all love.
