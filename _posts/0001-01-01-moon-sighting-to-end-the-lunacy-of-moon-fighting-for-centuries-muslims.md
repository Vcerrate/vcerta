{% raw %}For centuries, Muslims followed the prophetic practice (sunnah) of moon sighting to determine the beginning of lunar months. However, in recent times, there is a call to abandon this important sunnah in favor of calculation and a pre-determined calendar. This has lead to the lunacy of “moon fighting”—back-and-forth quarreling that is renewed every Ramadan. In this video, Dr. Youssef Ismail, who has a PhD in mechanical engineering from Stanford University and is a professor of astronomy, math, and jurisprudence at Zaytuna College, takes us on an extraordinary journey through the science and practice of moon sighting and explains why this timeless sunnah is a critical part of our worship and connection to our Creator. <br /><br />Support Zaytuna College: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://zaytuna.edu/illuminate">https://zaytuna.edu/illuminate</a>{% endraw %}
