{% raw %}Material drying is the removal of water from a material or product. The drying of powdered material is an important part of the powder processing industry today. There are several types of drying. They are:<br /><br />Filtration Drying<br /><br />Filtration drying involves using force to push the wet material against a filter. The liquid will move through the filter, while the solid material will stay against the filter. This separates the water and liquid, thereby effectively drying the material.<br /><br />Centrifugation<br /><br />Centrifugation is the use of rotation to separate the liquid and powder by density. If the mixture of the liquid and powder are rotate quickly enough, the powder will move away from the liquid, thereby separating the powder and liquid. This dries the material.<br /><br />Evaporation<br /><br />Evaporation is the removal of the liquid from the solid by exposing the liquid to heat. This turns the liquid into a gas, thereby causing the liquid to evaporate in the air, rather than separating itself from the solid.<br /><br />Freeze Drying<br /><br />Freeze Drying involves freezing the liquid with the solid, and then exposing the frozen liquid to a vacuum, causing it to sublime directly into a gas. Much like the evaporation method, this then causes the liquid to evaporate into the air, leaving the solid dry.<br /><br />If you wish to learn more about material drying technologies, be sure to watch the full webinar.{% endraw %}
