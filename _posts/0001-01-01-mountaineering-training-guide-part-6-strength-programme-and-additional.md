{% raw %}Want to climb a mountain? I'm a Strength and Conditioning coach helping mountaineers reach their goals.<br /><br />We’re now getting closer to the end of the training guide folks.<br />This is the sixth video in my training guide that aims to help mountaineers and hikers improve their fitness and reach their goals. <br /><br />This video’s focus will be on offering additional exercises needed for strength.<br />These exercises will explore other movements and focus on getting you strong outside of the linear planes of movement that most exercises have you work through.<br />This in turn will help you move better in the mountain environment and get you stronger in dealing with more technical movements.<br /><br />At the end of the video I’m also offering a Strength Programme that’s put together using everything we covered so far in the previous videos.<br /><br />If you have any more specific questions on where to begin your mountaineering training or have any other fitness related questions, leave a comment and I'll answer them in the following videos.{% endraw %}
