{% raw %}Picking up from where we left off in the previous video I've make some good progress on the sidings.  The main focus is on the weathering and scenery such as grass and bushes.  I've also made a start on some of the details such as scrap rail, litter and various small 3d printed items.  Still very much a work in progress but I'm happy with how it's looking.  Enjoy{% endraw %}
