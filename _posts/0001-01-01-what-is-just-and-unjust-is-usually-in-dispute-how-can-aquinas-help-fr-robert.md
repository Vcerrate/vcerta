{% raw %}What is Just and Unjust is Usually in Dispute: How Can Aquinas Help? | Fr. Robert Ombres, OP<br /><br />The search for the meaning and application of justice, and the avoidance of injustice, has a long history and is constantly in dispute. Aquinas has much to say about this central dimension of our moral lives in community. He is philosophically coherent and robust, which makes his thought helpful in dialogue with others who do not share the Christian faith.<br /><br />Fr Robert Ombres, OP qualified as a lawyer before joining the English Province in 1970. He was the Orderâ€™s Procurator General from 2004 to 2011. He teaches moral theology and canon law at Blackfriars, Oxford and canon law at the Angelicum (Rome).<br /><br />This talk is part of our Virtue Online Series: St. Thomas' Guide to Happiness and the Moral Life.
