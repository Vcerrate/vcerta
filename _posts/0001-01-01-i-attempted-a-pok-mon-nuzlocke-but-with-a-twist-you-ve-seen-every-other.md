{% raw %}You've seen every other creator attempt a Pokémon nuzlocke, but have you ever see one do it like this?<br />➤ MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://pleasebuymymerch.com">http://pleasebuymymerch.com</a><br />➤ TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/alpharad">https://twitter.com/alpharad</a><br />➤ INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/alpharad">https://www.instagram.com/alpharad</a><br />#Pokemon #Nuzlocke #Alpharad<br /><br />After succeeding in a &quot;two-player nuzlocke&quot; with JaidenAnimations a few months ago, I was itching to attempt another Pokémon nuzlocke. In fact, I have been binge watching Jan's content recently on Pokemon Challenges, but I needed to do something myself. Watching him yell at RTGame, Mizkif, and Xqc simply wasn't enough for me anymore.<br /><br />Fortunately, an idea came to me while hosting (and winning) &quot;Alpharad's Pokémon Unite Awesome Invitational&quot; tournament with some amazing creators beside me: Captain Kidd, Atrioc, Ovilee May, and Cybertron. After the success of that tournament while conquering Wolfe Glick's team in the finals, I had the perfect idea... but first, I had to pull Cybertron and Captain Kidd from my team, steal WolfeyVGC from the enemy team, and then ask WeegeeTheGod to join because he is my friend. I was set out to attempt the first ever nuzlocke (that I know of) for Pokémon Unite. <br /><br />We started with Machamp, Charizard, Slowbro, Pikachu, and Venusaur. If we lost a single match, those characters would be gone forever. Given that I only know how to play 3 Pokémon in this game... I knew that I had one insane challenge ahead of me.<br /><br />THE UNITE NUZLOCKE TEAM:<br />➤ @WolfeyVGC <br />➤ @Captain Kidd <br />➤ @CybertronVGC <br />➤ @Weegee Plays<br /><br />VIDEO EDITOR:<br />➤ ME!!!!!
