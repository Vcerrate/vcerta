{% raw %}The law of large numbers is a principle that states experimental probability will become closer to theoretical probability as more and more trials are conducted- i.e. the larger the number of trials in an experiment the closer the outcome gets to the theoretical probability.  This video will go over an example of the law of large numbers to understand that expected results of an experiment may not be what we calculated as the theoretical probability.  <br />TabletClass Math Academy Math Courses:<br />Pre-Algebra:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tabletclass-academy.teachable.com/p/tabletclass-math-pre-algebra1">https://tabletclass-academy.teachable.com/p/tabletclass-math-pre-algebra1</a> <br />Algebra 1:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tabletclass-academy.teachable.com/p/tabletclass-math-algebra1">https://tabletclass-academy.teachable.com/p/tabletclass-math-algebra1</a> <br />Geometry:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tabletclass-academy.teachable.com/p/tabletclass-math-geometry1">https://tabletclass-academy.teachable.com/p/tabletclass-math-geometry1</a> <br />Algebra 2:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tabletclass-academy.teachable.com/p/tabletclass-math-algebra-21">https://tabletclass-academy.teachable.com/p/tabletclass-math-algebra-21</a> <br />GED Math:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tabletclass-academy.teachable.com/p/ged-math-lessons-premium-accelerator1">https://tabletclass-academy.teachable.com/p/ged-math-lessons-premium-accelerator1</a> <br />HISET Math:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tabletclass-academy.teachable.com/p/hiset-math-lessons-premium-accelerator2">https://tabletclass-academy.teachable.com/p/hiset-math-lessons-premium-accelerator2</a> <br />TASC Math:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tabletclass-academy.teachable.com/p/tasc-math-lessons-premium-accelerator22">https://tabletclass-academy.teachable.com/p/tasc-math-lessons-premium-accelerator22</a>{% endraw %}
