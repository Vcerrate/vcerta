{% raw %}The International Dialogue on the Role of Islamic Social Financing in Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals is a global discussion on unlocking the potential of Islamic social financing to support global efforts to end extreme poverty, boost economic development, respond to the impact of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic and help countries get back on track to meet the Sustainable Development Goals – the world’s blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030.<br /><br />We invite global leaders, Islamic institutions, government representatives to join the discussion. The Dialogue is part of the Initiative on Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond, which calls on the international community to utilize innovative forms of public and private finance to support pandemic response.<br /><br />The Dialogue consists of a series of virtual Seminars designed to foster a better understanding of both Islamic social financing and existing UN platforms and initiatives.<br /><br />Following the Seminars, the Dialogue will -<br />1. establish a knowledge database to serve as a longstanding repository of information and resources on Islamic social financing and the SDGs;<br />2. prepare a draft roadmap, with concrete recommendations, on the way forward to enrich existing mechanisms, identify gaps, and propose methods of using Islamic social financing to achieve the SDGs.{% endraw %}
