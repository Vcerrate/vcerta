It is mostly spread by malicious links via email or chat applications. When a link with the malware is received, clicking on this link activates the spyware which allows the hacker to spy on all our user information. With some spyware systems, even clicking on the link isn‚Äôt necessary to trigger the malicious payload. One such spyware system that is making the rounds in the tech industry today is Pegasus.<br /><br />Pegasus Spyware was launched by the NSO group in Israel, with the primary purpose being counter-terrorism via the internet. The extensive spying package was found to be attached with certain high profile personnel and their devices, leading to a worldwide investigation on the consequences of such spyware campaigns. It spanned across countries, and the root malware featured a malicious payload that was able to infect devices irrespective of the operating system. With more and more encrypted communication channels coming to the forefront, Pegasus was designed to maintain control over data transmission that can be a threat to national security. Multiple devices can be affected with the same spyware system to create a network of information that keeps feeding data to the host. The one thing where pegasus stands out is its zero-click actions feature. <br /><br />About Simplilearn Cyber Security Master's Program:<br />The Cyber Security Expert Master‚Äôs Program will equip you with the skills needed to become an expert in this rapidly growing domain.
