{% raw %}a. A cylinder of gas is assumed to contain `11.2 kg` of butane. If a normal family needs `20000kJ` of energy per day for cooking, how long will the cylinder last? Given that the heat of combustion of butane is `2658 kJ mol^(-1)`.  b. If the air supply of the burner is insufficient (i.e. you have a yellow instead of a blue flame), a portion of the gas escape without combustion. Assuming that `33%` of the gas is wasted due to this inefficiency, how long would the cylinder last?{% endraw %}
