{% raw %}You are Awesome! Have a great day :)<br /><br />Jose Raul Capablanca - Savielly Tartakower <br />New York (New York, NY USA) [6] A40 1924.03.23<br /><br />1.d4 Notes by Alekhine and Reti. 1...e6 2.Nf3 f5 3.c4 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.Nc3 O-O 6.e3 b6 7.Bd3 Bb7 8.O-O Qe8 9.Qe2 Ne4 10.Bxe7 Nxc3 11.bxc3 Qxe7 12.a4 Bxf3 13.Qxf3 Nc6 14.Rfb1 Rae8 15.Qh3 Rf6 16.f4 Na5 17.Qf3 d6 18.Re1 Qd7 19.e4 fxe4 20.Qxe4 g6 21.g3 Kf8 22.Kg2 Rf7 23.h4 d5 24.cxd5 exd5 25.Qxe8+ Qxe8 26.Rxe8+ Kxe8 27.h5 27.Rf6 28.hxg6 hxg6 29.Rh1 29.Kf8 30.Rh7 Rc6 31.g4 31.Nc4 32.g5 He gives his opponent the opportunity of winning a pawn. But Capablanca has confidence in the passed pawn which he obtains. – Reti 32...Ne3+ 33.Kf3 Nf5 34.Bxf5 Simple and compelling. – Alekhine 34...gxf5 35.Kg3 Decisive! White sacrifices material in order to obtain the classical position with King on f6, pawn on g6, and Rook on h7, whereupon the black pawns tumble like ripe apples. – Alekhine 35...Rxc3+ It is extremely instructive to see how Capablanca is no longer in the least concerned about material equality, but thinks only of supporting his passed pawn. – Reti 36.Kh4 Rf3 37.g6 Rxf4+ 38.Kg5 Re4 39.Kf6 It is a frequently available finesse in such positions not to capture hostile pawns, but to pass them by in order to be protected in the rear against checks by the rook. – Reti 39...Kg8 40.Rg7+ Kh8 41.Rxc7 Re8 42.Kxf5 Again the simplest. Kf7 would not yet have been disastrous because of Rd8, etc. – Alekhine 42...Re4 43.Kf6 Rf4+ 44.Ke5 Rg4 45.g7+ Kg8 After exchanging rooks, White would win still more easily. – Alekhine 46.Rxa7 Rg1 47.Kxd5 Rc1 48.Kd6 Rc2 49.d5 Rc1 50.Rc7 Ra1 51.Kc6 Rxa4 52.d6 <br /><br />00:00 Hello Everyone!<br />01:44 Game Starts!<br />02:44 Completely New Game!<br />08:20 Pause the Video!<br />12:15 Pause The Video 2!<br />16:20 It Was In This Position <br />18:00 Contributions<br /><br />The Belgrade FIDE Grand Prix is the 16-player second of three legs of the 24-player 2022 FIDE Grand Prix that qualifies two players to the Candidates Tournament. Each player competes in two of the three tournaments, with the 16 players divided into four groups who play a double round-robin. The group winners advance to a knockout. Tiebreaks at any stage are played on the following day. Players can earn a maximum of 13 points for winning a leg.<br /><br />Players receive 90 minutes for 40 moves, followed by 30 minutes to the end of the game, plus a 30-second increment starting from move one. In case of a tie a 15+10 two-game match is played. If still tied, a 3+2 two-game match follows and then, if needed, an Armageddon game, where White has 5 minutes to Black's 4, but a draw counts as a win for Black. If more than two players are tied a round-robin tiebreak is played.
