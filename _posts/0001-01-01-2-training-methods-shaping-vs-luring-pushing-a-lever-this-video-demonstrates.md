{% raw %}This video demonstrates the difference between using shaping to train an animal, and using luring to train an animal.  Luring requires the trainer to guide the animal into the right position, while shaping has the trainer reward the animal for any motions it makes that resemble the final product (and gradually up the requirements until the final product is achieved). Bothe methods prove effective, and I often use both while training my rats.
