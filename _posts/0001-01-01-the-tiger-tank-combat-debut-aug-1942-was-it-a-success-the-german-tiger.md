{% raw %}The German Tiger is arguably the most well-known tank of the Second World War. <br /><br />The Tiger's impregnable armour, powerful gun and enormous stature made it a legend in its time.<br /><br />Hitler, eager to employ the powerful new weapon, ordered the vehicle to be forced into service months ahead of schedule.<br /><br />On 23 July 1942, Hitler ordered that the first Tiger tanks be sent to the Leningrad Front. By the end of August, just nine Tigers had been accepted by the Army indicating that production had gone behind schedule. <br /><br />Heavy Tank Battalion 502 was the first unit to receive the new tank.<br /><br />The Tigers suffered mechanical teething problems as new vehicles which resulted in frequent technical failures and breakdowns. Employees of Henschel, who manufactured the tank and Maybach who built the engine, were crucial to the Battalion's success.<br /><br />A platoon of four Tigers went into action on 29 August 1942 near Leningrad. Operating in swampy, forested terrain, their movement was largely confined to roads and tracks making defence against them far easier. <br /><br />It was an unpromising start for the tank, that would go on to become the most infamous in history.<br /><br />Music Credits:  All This Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br />Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a><br /><br />Copyright fair use notice<br /><br />All media used in this video is used for the purpose of education under the terms of fair use.<br /><br />All footage and images used belong to their copyright holders.<br /><br />#TigerTank #GermanTank #FactBytes{% endraw %}
