{% raw %}As water shut off valves age, calcium builds up and when you shut them off and turn them back on again, they begin to leak.  There becomes a point when they will not stop leaking and you have to replace the valve.  In this case, the valve is soldered on copper pipe. I am not an expert plumber but with some skills this may be a job the home DIYer, like myself, can handle.{% endraw %}
