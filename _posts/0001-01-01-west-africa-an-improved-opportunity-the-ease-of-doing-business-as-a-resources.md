{% raw %}The ease of doing business as a resources company in West Africa has progressed materially since the region burst onto investor radars almost 20 years ago, according to a panel of experts convened by Mining Journal. The panel said the region had grown to become a globally significant gold producer on the back of exceptional geology, a deepening pool of local mining-specific skills, and the unwavering political will of albeit unstable bureaucracies to see resources developed.<br /><br />In this session, Mining Journal managing editor Chris Cann discusses West Africaâ€™s prolific greenstone belts, the challenges that remain for resources companies active in the region, and how best to managing risk with Edison Investment Research director of mining Charles Gibson, Verisk Maplecroft senior Africa analyst Eric Humphery-Smith, Fortuna Silver Mines CEO Jorge Ganoza, Asante Gold CEO Dave Anthony, and Marvel Gold MD Chris van Wijk.{% endraw %}
