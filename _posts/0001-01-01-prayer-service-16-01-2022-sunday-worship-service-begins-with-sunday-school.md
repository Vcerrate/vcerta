{% raw %}Sunday Worship Service begins with Sunday School. It is always a time to dive deep into revelations from Godâ€™s Word with practical insights. Over the years, through these invigorating times of fellowship with the Word, many have matured spiritually, with undeniable deliverance from the power of sin and death.<br /><br />Sunday School is then accompanied by intense worship and praise to the One who sits on the Throne as well as the wholesome Word of God for His people per season. In addition, our Sunday Services have witnessed moves of the Spirit of God with spiritual gifts including the gifts of tongues and interpretation, healing, word of knowledge, prophecy, and more. <br /><br />To make the most of your Sundays, be at the NLWC Sunday Worship Service! Join us online every Sunday via www.nlwc.church/listenlive OR www.mixlr.com/nlwc for AUDIO, and www.nlwc.church/watchlive for VIDEO.{% endraw %}
