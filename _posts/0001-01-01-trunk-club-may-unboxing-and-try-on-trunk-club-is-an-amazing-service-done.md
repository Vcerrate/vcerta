{% raw %}Trunk Club is an amazing service done by Nordstrom.  You fill out a profile and work with a stying team to curate your trunk.  You will get to review your trunk and request changes prior to shipping.  You pay a $25.00 styling fee which is applied to whatever you purchase.<br />However, if you use a Nordstrom card this fee is waived.  I love the quality and variety of this box‚ù§Ô∏è Keep what you love and return the rest, free shipping both ways.<br />If you would like to try Trunk Club please use my link and we will both receive a $50.00 creditüôå win/win!!<br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.trunkclub.com/referral/UVN239?c=referral_link">https://www.trunkclub.com/referral/UVN239?c=referral_link</a><br /><br />Contact me at <br />coachmslagle@gmail.com<br /><br />Or connect with me on Facebook<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/melissa.slagle.77">https://www.facebook.com/melissa.slagle.77</a>{% endraw %}
