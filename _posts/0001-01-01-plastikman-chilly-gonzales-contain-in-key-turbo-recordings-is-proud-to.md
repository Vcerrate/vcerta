{% raw %}Turbo Recordings is proud to present 'Consumed In Key', a reimagining of Plastikman’s 1998 magnum opus ‘Consumed’, TRANSFORMED as a new collaborative composition between original artist Richie Hawtin and musical genius Chilly Gonzales… a project three decades in the making, brought into the world by Executive Producer &amp; co-visionary Tiga.<br /><br />‘Consumed in Key’ is born of the obsessive love of a timeless work of art, an obsessive fascination untempered by fearful reverence. It is the result of a 30-year cycle of musical evolution and inspiration, a touch of Canadian kismet and artists finding common ground where others would see none.<br /><br />More than anything, it is a beautiful piece of music born of our times: immersive, haunting and ultimately joyous.<br /><br />Stream the debut single ‘Contain (In Key)’ &amp; preorder the album via <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ConsumedInKey.com">https://www.ConsumedInKey.com</a><br /><br />Subscribe on YouTube: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TurboRecordings?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/TurboRecordings?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /> <br />Subscribe to Turbo World News: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/turboworldnews">http://bit.ly/turboworldnews</a><br /><br />Connect:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://turborecordings.com/">https://turborecordings.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.spoti.fi/332HIq8">https://www.spoti.fi/332HIq8</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/turborecordings">https://www.facebook.com/turborecordings</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/turborecordings">https://soundcloud.com/turborecordings</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/turborecordings/">https://www.instagram.com/turborecordings/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/turborecordings">https://twitter.com/turborecordings</a>{% endraw %}
