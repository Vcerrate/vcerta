{% raw %}Weston College (Weston Super Mare) have shared their video with us – this was filmed in autumn last year (2013). It shows the students following Environment Agency’s Bristol/Avon and Somerset field teams to find out what makes up a day in the life of a flood operative. The students visit Currymoor Pumping Station, Brislington Boat Screen and the Poets Fields flood plain and talk to the team members about their typical working days.{% endraw %}
