We played til we ran dry.<br />But we didn’t mind, caution to the wind and the sky.<br />Our souls were stolen by those devilish eyes.<br />What can I say boys? We were hypnotized.<br /><br />Do-do-don’t go makin’ those deals with the devil.<br />Do-do-don’t go makin’ those deals with the devil.<br />Do-do-don’t go makin’ those deals with the devil.<br /><br />It’s just you and me,<br />What a team.<br />Gonna see how we get outta,<br />That evil contract,<br />But we’re our own worst enemy.<br />Guess that’s what you get for being greedy.<br />What in tarnation?<br />It’s Cagney Carnation!<br />How did we fall so far into temptation?<br />We traded our souls for fields of gold,<br />Now we’re runnin’ and gunnin’, we lost all control,  <br /><br />Fighting for our lives,<br />We must pay the price.<br />Lady luck on my left.<br />My best friend on my right.<br />Raise your cup,<br />Say cheers to us.<br />Cuz we’re gonna need it.<br />Here’s to defeatin’ the demon.<br /><br />Do-do-don’t go makin’ those deals with the devil.<br />Do-do-don’t go makin’ those deals with the devil.<br />Do-do-don’t go makin’ those deals with the devil.<br />Do-do-don’t go makin’ those deals with the devil.<br />Do-do-don’t go makin’ those deals with the devil.<br />Do-do-don’t go makin’ those deals with the devil.<br /><br />#cupheadshow #cg5 #devil{% endraw %}
