{% raw %}Why I am going to the Ukrainian border when it is the war there? Because I arrived in Austria not from Ukraine, after the war started. That's why to get shelter in Austria and be with the family I had to go and cross the border with Ukraine. My father took me in the car to the railway station in Upper Austria, it took us about 1 hour. Then I sit on the train and went to Vien, Austria, and from Vien to Budapest, Hungary. The journey was 4 hours. Then I wait about 2 hours in Starbucks. I am a Ukrainian citizen and I am pregnant, that's why it makes this journey more complicated. Then I sit on the next train, from Budapest, Hungary to Kosice, Slovakia. The road took 3,5 hours. I reached Slovakia and met my friends. The next morning I went to the border of Slovakia and Ukraine by car with another friend. Everything went well, I crossed the border and we got back to Slovakia, Kosice. It took us about 5 hours. Katya also escaped the war in Ukraine, Kharkiv, and stays with her family in Kosice.<br /><br />üéàI post daily stories about my life on Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/a_niki_na/‚Äã‚Äã">https://www.instagram.com/a_niki_na/‚Äã‚Äã</a><br /><br />‚≠ê Get my brand new GUIDE on how to build an International Freelance Business - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://anikina.gumroad.com/l/freelan...">https://anikina.gumroad.com/l/freelan...</a><br />‚≠ê Sign up for the FREE newsletter about Online Career - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://anikina.gumroad.com/l/freenew...">https://anikina.gumroad.com/l/freenew...</a><br /><br />‚≠ê Uluslararasƒ± Freelance ƒ∞≈ü Kurma KILAVUZU | Turkish - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://anikina.gumroad.com/l/freelan...">https://anikina.gumroad.com/l/freelan...</a><br />‚≠ê Free Newsletter about Freelance | Turkish - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://anikina.gumroad.com/l/freenew...">https://anikina.gumroad.com/l/freenew...</a><br /><br /><br />My husband and I both are digital nomads. <br />We love to explore our world and work online.<br />We started our journey 3,5 years ago!<br />Welcome to our adventure! <br /><br />#homesurfers‚Äã‚Äã #Austria{% endraw %}
