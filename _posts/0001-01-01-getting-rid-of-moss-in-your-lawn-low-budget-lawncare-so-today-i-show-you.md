{% raw %}So today i show you about how easy it is getting RID of MOSS in your LAWN with a one pass scarify and on a low budget. Getting rid of moss is the most important job if you want a nice lawn<br /><br />#gettingridofmoss #scarifyingyourlawn #lowbudgetlawncare letyourlawnbreathe<br /><br /><br />Using COMPOST to cover GRASS seed is one way to get the grass seed up and away quickly as it holds onto water better than sand does, but you can not level lawns with compost, today I scalp the grass as short as I can to remove the top growth , this allows the grass to start from scratch and new fresh shoots will carry us forward into the summer along with the new grass seed, after scalping the grass I scarify to remove thatch, twigs, leaves from the surface and create grooves in the grass for the new seed to fall into to offer better protection along with the compost on top. <br /><br />the compost I like to use is jacks magic as this contains hardly any big lumps which can be troublesome to the grass at first, this helps the grass seed to get off to a great start.<br /><br />#compostforseed #topdressingseed #lawngoals #lawngoalsstarthere #coveringseed #scarifying<br />#danielhibbertlawnexpert<br /><br />Visit my Ebay store at www.ebay.co.uk/str/danielhibbertlawnexpert<br />or click the links below<br /><br />H2GO Wetting Agent<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/154848809631">https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/154848809631</a><br /><br />Steller Bio Boost 1ltr to treat 500m2<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/154691227396">https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/154691227396</a><br /><br />Galactic Green 1Ltr to treat 250m2<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/154691101998">https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/154691101998</a><br /><br />Also join my Facebook group Daniel Hibbert Lawn Expert Geek Haven if you haven't already<br /><br />Instagram @danielhibbert79<br /><br /><br />About the channel<br /><br />Daniel Hibbert Lawn Expert aims to bring you easy to follow and understand methods, tips and most  importantly end results to make your lawn care journey enjoyable and successful, With over 25 years of working on domestic lawns there is not much I don't know and am happy to guide everyone on the way to their own lawn dreams<br /><br />Throughout history men have always been drawn to grass, weather it be in the park , a sports ground or simply in your own garden, there's just something about those quintessential British stripes that makes you want them for yourself, not to mention getting on over on your neighbours.
