{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.cheapjoes.com">http://www.cheapjoes.com</a> -- Welcome to Cheap Joe's Test Studio!<br /><br /><br /><br />Today I'm going to show you how to use a spatter screen to add texture to your watercolors. Lots of fun and another way to add texture.<br /><br /><br /><br />You take the spatter screen--and there is no right or wrong side--and you activate some color on your palette.  Come over here and pick some paint up and paint right on the screen.  Then you take the spatter screen where you want the texture, and you hold the screen about .5&quot; or .25&quot; above the painting, and you want to come down and simply blow on it.  There's the spatter!  While it's wet like that, take your rigger brush and load just a little color into it and pull some twigs coming out of it to make a little bush here. <br /><br /><br /><br />That's the spatter screen, and a fun way to add some texture to a particular area.{% endraw %}
