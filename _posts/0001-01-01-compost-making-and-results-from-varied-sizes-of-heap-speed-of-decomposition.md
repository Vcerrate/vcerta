{% raw %}Speed of decomposition. heap heat and eventual results can vary a lot! See a range of possibilities for making compost.<br />This is May and already there is a decent amount of new growth. I show you how we add it to heaps of varied types and dimensions here. <br />A key tip is to balance green and brown.
