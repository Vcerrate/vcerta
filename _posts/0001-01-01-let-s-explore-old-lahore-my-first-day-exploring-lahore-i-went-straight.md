{% raw %}My first day exploring Lahore, I went straight to the old town, known by foreigners as the 'Walled City' and by as locals by 'Androon Shehar' (Inner City).<br /><br />The walled city of Lahore has existed since medieval time but during the Mughal period it became the Mughal capital and a huge fort was built.<br /><br />I entered the walled city through Delhi Gate, one of the 6 still existing ancient gates that serve as passageways through the massive fortified walls.<br /><br />I wanted to make my to Lahore Fort, which was within easy walking distance according to Google Maps. According to reality, it was really difficult. The walled city seems to be a huge market area with very narrow streets. Narrow streets that were packed with people, motorbikes and other obstacles.<br /><br />When I reached Lahore Fort I had a lot more walking to do, as I seemed to have arrived at the opposite end from the main entrance, which is the only way in.<br /><br />Outside the fort there is a nice green area where people were relaxing in the sun and eating snacks from the vendors. It's a nice vibe.<br /><br />To enter the fort I had to buy a 'special' foreigners ticket that was 500 rupees. I don't know how much it costs for locals but I saw people ahead of me in the queue buy tickets for their whole family, hand over 500 rupees and get a piled of change back.<br /><br />Inside the fort area there were hundreds of people relaxing on the grass, among the ruins. It had the same kind of vibe as Lodhi Gardens in Delhi, which is one of my favourite places in that city.<br /><br />The fort itself, some areas were well restored and had information signs and other areas were unrestored, with no access to visitors and no signs.<br /><br />I spent a good half hour in there, walking around at a decent pace, and that was enough for me.<br /><br />There was another huge structure next to the fort that I thought was a large palace, but when I got to the entrance I discovered it was a Mosque, which I couldn't enter because I was wearing shorts.<br /><br />I finished off the Old Lahore adventure with some street food snacks. One vendor was selling 'Dragon Balls' which were little maize crisps things in a cup with liquid nitrogen. When you eat them you breathe out smoke, hence where the dragon name comes from.<br /><br />That perked my appetite up a bit, so I went looking for more local snacks and discovered some sort of sweet. I was given a free sample by the vendor and I loved it. It was some sort of sticky, chewy rice cake that tasted like toffee and had cashew nuts through it.<br /><br />I washed that down with a fresh orange juice, served in a pint glass, from a vendor on the same street. I was fully satisfied and then caught a rickshaw back to where I'm staying in the upmarket Gulberg area.<br /><br />0:00 Walled City<br />0:50 Outside Lahore Fort<br />3:00 Inside Lahore Fort<br />13:56 Big Mosque<br />15:41 Dragon Smoke Balls<br />18:10 Local Lahore Sweet<br />19:47 Fresh Orange Juice<br /><br />ðŸ’— Help the channel grow by liking, commenting and subscribing.
