{% raw %}If you don't like the ship then feel free to go, this video isn't mean to you.<br /><br />Also for the past Ennard and Michael timeline is several years after Ennard scooped Michael- probably 5-6 years later and they still live together cuz after Michael spit Ennard into the sewer, Ennard came back to him just like canon peepaw /j. Oh and if you watched my old video about past Ennard and Michael stuck with their future selves, then this video is not a remake.<br /><br />Also keep in mind that my AU isn't completely following the canon lore and it would be useless to comment anything related to lore because i don't give a f-ck.<br /><br />Anyways :D <br /><br />A few parts has reference from my EnnChael book in wattpad, if you want to read it then here's the link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/296229534">https://www.wattpad.com/story/296229534</a><br /><br />And i hope you like this video :DD<br />Have a great day/night, Stars!<br /><br />Discord server: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/9NGmUFPmQc">https://discord.gg/9NGmUFPmQc</a>{% endraw %}
