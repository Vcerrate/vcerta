Wash hands with dawn dish soap (it's a degreaser and will remove oils) Wipe nails with an alcohol prep pad or nail polish remover to fully dry and remove all oils. Apply 1 coat base polish. Apply 2-3 coats of the nail polish and 1 coat of the top coat. Make sure to seal the tips of your nails! I also read that you should reapply the top coat every 2 days for maximum wear but I didn't do that. <br /><br /><br />⇒ Budget jeans pair 1 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3IzMwoV">https://bit.ly/3IzMwoV</a><br />⇒ Budget jeans pair 2 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3HxQHjF">https://bit.ly/3HxQHjF</a> <br />(true to size, slight stretch, i'm EU 32) These were on sale when I got them but still only $32 full price.
