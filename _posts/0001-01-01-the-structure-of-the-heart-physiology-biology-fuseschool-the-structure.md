{% raw %}The Structure of the heart | Physiology | Biology | FuseSchool<br /><br />Our heart, a universally recognised symbol of love, kindness and compassion.<br /><br />The heart is one of the hardest-working organs in your body after all it is responsible for pumping blood throughout a vast array of blood vessels, spending 100,000 kilometers in total. <br /><br />All those vessels laid end-to-end would encircle the earth 2.5 times all to be done in a heartbeat. This powerful muscular organ approximately the size of a fist, is usually drawn symmetrically like this; in reality, your heart is asymmetrical with the left side being more muscular than right for reasons that we'll explore later on. <br /><br />The heart is located in the middle of your chest but with a slight all to the left because of the bigger left side. In an anatomically correct model of the human heart the vertical septum separates the right side and the left side. Because we are looking at the heart on the front, the left side is here and the right side is here. (Watch the video to see where!)<br /><br /><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to the FuseSchool YouTube channel for many more educational videos. Our teachers and animators come together to make fun &amp; easy-to-understand videos in Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Maths &amp; ICT.<br /><br />VISIT us at www.fuseschool.org, where all of our videos are carefully organised into topics and specific orders, and to see what else we have on offer. Comment, like and share with other learners. You can both ask and answer questions, and teachers will get back to you.<br /><br />These videos can be used in a flipped classroom model or as a revision aid. <br /><br />Find all of our Chemistry videos here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0gavSzhMlReKGMVfUt6YuNQsO0bqSMV">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0gavSzhMlReKGMVfUt6YuNQsO0bqSMV</a><br /><br />Find all of our Biology videos here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0gavSzhMlQYSpKryVcEr3ERup5SxHl0">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0gavSzhMlQYSpKryVcEr3ERup5SxHl0</a><br /><br />Find all of our Physics videos here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0gavSzhMlTWm6Sr5uN2Uv5TXHiZUq8b">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0gavSzhMlTWm6Sr5uN2Uv5TXHiZUq8b</a><br /><br />Find all of our Maths videos here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0gavSzhMlTKBNbHH5u1SNnsrOaacKLu">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0gavSzhMlTKBNbHH5u1SNnsrOaacKLu</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/fuseschool/">https://www.instagram.com/fuseschool/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/fuseschool/">https://www.facebook.com/fuseschool/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/fuseSchool">https://twitter.com/fuseSchool</a><br /><br />Access a deeper Learning Experience in the FuseSchool platform and app: www.fuseschool.org<br />Follow us: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/fuseschool">http://www.youtube.com/fuseschool</a><br />Befriend us: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/fuseschool">http://www.facebook.com/fuseschool</a><br /><br />This is an Open Educational Resource.
