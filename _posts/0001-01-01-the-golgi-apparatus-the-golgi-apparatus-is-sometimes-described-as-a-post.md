{% raw %}The Golgi apparatus is sometimes described as a post office because it repackages proteins and chemicals and ships them to locations in the cell.<br />Where is Golgi Apparatus located? It is located near the Endoplasmic reticulum ( ER)<br />The side of the Golgi apparatus towards the ER is the cis Golgi.<br />The side facing away from the ER is the trans-Golgi<br /><br />The Golgi body is found in plant and animal cells.<br />The Golgi apparatus repacks proteins from the ER and packs them in vesicles and sends them to three locations.<br />The lysosome, out of the cell, or to the plasma membrane.<br /><br />The Golgi apparatus receives proteins from the rough ER and repackages the proteins and chemicals into vesicles that are sent out to three locations.<br /><br />A cell crossword puzzle<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.moomoomath.com/a-cell-crossword-puzzle.html">http://www.moomoomath.com/a-cell-crossword-puzzle.html</a><br />cell.<br />-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-<br />Please watch: &quot;Study Skills Teacher's Secret Guide to your Best Grades&quot; <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3bsg8gaSbw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3bsg8gaSbw</a><br />-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-<br />*<br />For more Life Science videos and summaries see,<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.moomoomath.com/Middle-School-Science-and-Biology.html">http://www.moomoomath.com/Middle-School-Science-and-Biology.html</a>{% endraw %}
