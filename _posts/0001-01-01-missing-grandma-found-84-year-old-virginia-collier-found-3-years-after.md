{% raw %}The mysterious disappearance of 84-year-old Virginia Collier has been solved after 3-years.  <br /><br />Virginia left her brother's home on Macon Street in Glencoe, Alabama March 15, 2019 heading north in her electric blue 2019 Kia Optima with the Florida license plate number I175MQ and simply vanished for 3-years. <br /><br />This documentary brings you alongside Adventures With Purpose's final underwater search in the area, following clues as to Virginia's last known location that day. In the end, it was hunters who found Virginia and her car in the woods where she crashed 3-years earlier.<br /><br />PREVIOUS SEARCHES BY AWP AND EXPLORING WITH NUG<br />========<br />COLD CASE: 83-Year-Old Missing Grandma (Virginia Collier)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EZ0RwNOTmJA">https://youtu.be/EZ0RwNOTmJA</a><br /><br />Unknown Car Found Underwater Searching For Virginia Collier!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Yjq4qir6vNA">https://youtu.be/Yjq4qir6vNA</a><br /><br />COLD CASE: More Cars Found Searching For Virginia Collier!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SAIPclHlIPo">https://youtu.be/SAIPclHlIPo</a><br /><br />2-IN-1 WINDOW BREAKER SEAT BELT CUTTER (Might Save Your Life)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://adventureswithpurpose.com/products/2-in-1-emergency-window-breaker">https://adventureswithpurpose.com/products/2-in-1-emergency-window-breaker</a><br /><br />HOW CAN YOU HELP?<br />========<br />‚û¶ Share this video and SPREAD AWARENESS of the service AWP provides for FREE!<br /><br />Because of your support, We Don't Charge Families for our time to serve in helping them locate their lost loved ones, so please, SHARE this video and awareness about AWP so that other families in need can find us.<br /><br />üéØ Subscribe to AWP on YouTube (It's Free)...‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubAWP">http://bit.ly/SubAWP</a><br />üëï AWP Merch and Donations..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://adventureswithpurpose.com">https://adventureswithpurpose.com</a><br />üé¨ BECOME A MEMBER (Get Videos Early)... ‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/AWP-Team-Member">http://bit.ly/AWP-Team-Member</a><br />‚úÖ Follow Us on Facebook... ‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/FollowAWP">https://bit.ly/FollowAWP</a><br /><br />HOW IS AWP FUNDED?... ‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wz1dCguO2y0">https://youtu.be/wz1dCguO2y0</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO OTHERS ON THE TEAM<br />‚òû Subscribe to Doug..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/DougBishop">http://bit.ly/DougBishop</a><br />‚òû Sub to Josh..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/SubJoshCantu">https://bit.ly/SubJoshCantu</a><br />‚òû Carson on Instagram..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/CarsonOnInstagram">https://bit.ly/CarsonOnInstagram</a><br />‚òû Subscribe to Nug..‚û§  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/SubExploringWithNUG">https://bit.ly/SubExploringWithNUG</a><br /><br />Questions or Want to Tell Us About a Case?<br />Email: support@adventureswithpurpose.com<br />========<br /><br />HUNTER'S DISCOVERY SOLVES THE MYSTERY OF VIRGINIA COLLIER'S DISAPPEARANCE<br />================<br />Etowah County Sheriff Jonathon Horton said on Wednesday morning, Feb 16th 2022, a group of rabbit hunters were on land they'd leased when one of their groups located a blue 2019 Kia in a wooded area.<br /><br />Horton said the hunter immediately contacted the sheriff's office, sending a photo of the car's license plate. It matched Collier's car tag.<br /><br />Near the front of the car, the sheriff said, the hunter found a purse with a wallet containing Collier's Florida driver's license. <br /><br />After Etowah County and Glencoe investigators met with the hunter at Black Creek Fire Department and they were led toward the site, investigators found a human cranium, then clothing and other bones.<br /><br />Glencoe Police Chief Kenon McKenzie said the investigation continues, but there's no suspicion of foul play. <br /><br />He said the car was found about 12 to 13 miles off Tabor Road, and he estimated it was about 12 miles from the home of Collier's brother ‚Äî where she was bound the night she was last seen alive.<br /><br />We are humbled by the opportunity all of you have given us to help in searches like this one for answers as to what happened to Virginia.<br /><br />In the end, it was not Adventures With Purpose or any other Search Team who found Virginia. It was the rabbit hunters being in the right place at the right time which gives us hope that others like Virginia will one day be found and brought home to their families as well. <br /><br />Hug the ones you love for you never know when it might be the last time you see them. <br /><br />As of the release of this documentary, because of your support: 19 Missing Person Cold Cases Have Been Solved since 2019, bringing resolution and answers to families looking for their lost loved ones.<br /><br />The AWP Movement would not be possible without your support as we document these cases, spreading awareness of our efforts, helping us travel the US offering our services for FREE to families, in search of their lost loved ones.<br /><br />Please Consider Donating to AWP and Help Further Our Efforts.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://adventureswithpurpose.com/products/make-a-donation">https://adventureswithpurpose.com/products/make-a-donation</a><br /><br />üé¨üçø Watch More of Our Missing Person Cold Case Recoveries<br /><br />SOLVED: Missing 23-years Underwater<br />(Samantha Hopper, 22-month-old Daughter Courtney, Unborn Baby)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/isqd8OOcJpQ">https://youtu.be/isqd8OOcJpQ</a><br /><br />SOLVED 84-Year-Old Missing Person Case..
