Boxed in a by a quarrelsome king, duplicitous advisors, and enemies on all sides, there is no recourse to resolve this peacefully. It seems that Diplomacy Is Not an Option!<br />Experience warfare on an entirely new scale as over 10 THOUSAND enemy units assault your castle walls. Do you have what it takes to save the kingdom? Is the kingdom even worth saving?<br /><br />The game has been designed with freedom as a core concept. The Endless Mode grants you full access to the tech tree and there are no limitations on how you approach the challenges that the procedurally generated maps provide. Go heavy on walls early, build large armies of cannon-fodder, or pursue the macro game of greedy growth and costly investments. Finding which style grants you the most success is up to you.The campaign will offer you challenges of combat and morality: it is a grim and unpleasant world. Few are worthy of your allegiance and even fewer will trust it. As in real life, stupidity and greed lie behind most problems, but here it is far too late to talk it through. You have no recourse to resolve this peacefully. At this stage: Diplomacy Is Not an Option!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272320/Diplomacy_is_Not_an_Option/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272320/Diplomacy_is_Not_an_Option/</a><br /><br />#realcivilengineer #engineering #DiplomacyIsNotAnOption{% endraw %}
