Some common things you could take are chamomile tea. Ginger ale works really great because the ginger and a little bit of that seltzer in there helps to remove some of the acid. The ginger helps to calm the nerves a little bit in your digestive tract. The chamomile works very similar to that as well. Occasionally, mint can work. It can work for some people. It can work for others. The mint helps to relax your lower esophageal sphincter so that you're able to burp if there's a lot of gas that's trapped in your stomach and causing a lot of pain. <br /><br />Anything that kind of calms and soothes your stomach is going to help. Pepto-Bismol works quite well by coating and getting rid of some of the inflammation that might be in your digestive tract. A little water can help to dilute down some of the enzymes or dilute down some of the acid in our stomach. Just quietly sitting also helps an upset stomach.<br /><br />You really want to avoid alcohol. Obviously, that's going to make things worse. You don't want to drink a lot of sugary soda because that sugar and the acid in the soda can irritate your stomach, cause more gas, and cause a lot of irritation. You want to stay on very simple, unprocessed foods, very bland foods, nothing too spicy. <br /><br />Again, keep it really simple. That's going to help you soothe an aching stomach.{% endraw %}
