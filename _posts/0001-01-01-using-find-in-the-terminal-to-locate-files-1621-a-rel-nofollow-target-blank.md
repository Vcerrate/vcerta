{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://macmost.com/e-1621">https://macmost.com/e-1621</a> An alternative to using Spotlight or the Finder to search for files is to use the Find command in the Terminal. You can search for files by name and refund the search by location, time and other factors. While not useful for everyday file searches, this could be used to search through large libraries of files for particular results.{% endraw %}
