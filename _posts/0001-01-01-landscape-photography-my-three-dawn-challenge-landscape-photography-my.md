{% raw %}Landscape Photography | My Three Dawn Challenge: <br />It's been ages since I filmed a field based video and a recent holiday seemed like an ideal opportunity for a landscape photography challenge. In creating this challenge I decided upon three consecutive dawn rises and a constrained working area to see what I could come up with. I love this type of constraint in my photography as it helps me to focus on my immediate surrounding and stops me from wandering around aimlessly. Dawn is also my favourite time of day, so I am at my most sensitive to my surroundings and tend to interpret the details in the landscape more creatively. <br /><br />Floating Our Boat: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/FloatingOurBoat/featured">https://www.youtube.com/c/FloatingOurBoat/featured</a><br /><br />Links to all my socials media and supporter pages: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/SimonBoothPhotography">https://linktr.ee/SimonBoothPhotography</a> <br /><br />My Amazon Shop <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/shop/simonbooth">https://www.amazon.co.uk/shop/simonbooth</a> <br /><br />Affiliated Products Country Innovation Clothing and Kase Filters and Vellerret Photography Gloves <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simonboothphotography.com/pro...">https://simonboothphotography.com/pro...</a> <br /><br />Vlog equipment: Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/9Dw8dB">https://goo.gl/9Dw8dB</a> <br />GoPro HERO5 Action Camera - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/qvWq4J">https://goo.gl/qvWq4J</a> <br />DJI Mavic Pro Drone - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/GJzxY6">https://goo.gl/GJzxY6</a> <br />Zoom H1 Handy Recorder - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/1hF16x">https://goo.gl/1hF16x</a> <br />Gitzo GT2542 Mountaineer Series 2 Carbon Tripod - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/u2HbCf">https://goo.gl/u2HbCf</a> <br /><br />Photographic equipment: Kase Filters: - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kasefilters.com/ref/SimonBooth/">https://kasefilters.com/ref/SimonBooth/</a> <br />Pentax 645z - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2OO36EE">https://amzn.to/2OO36EE</a> <br />Pentax â€“ HD 28-45mm f4.5 AW SR - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rb.gy/52beb2">https://rb.gy/52beb2</a> <br />Pentax - smc 45-85mm f4.5 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rb.gy/0e1c9b">https://rb.gy/0e1c9b</a> <br />Pentax smc 80-160mm f4.5 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rb.gy/bfb87e">https://rb.gy/bfb87e</a> <br />Pentax 120mm smc Macro f4 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rb.gy/db6098">https://rb.gy/db6098</a> <br /><br />Other<br />Gitzo GT4542LS Series 4 6X Systematic Carbon Tripod Other: Garmin Fenix 5 Activity watch and GPS - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ngstDD">https://amzn.to/2ngstDD</a> <br /><br />Music: Epidemic Sound{% endraw %}
