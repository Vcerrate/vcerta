{% raw %}Warm, fluffy, olive oil drenched focaccia is the signature bread of Genoa, on the Italia Riviera. Focaccia here is eaten at pretty much any time of the day: as a starter, a main, a snack, and even for dessert. Despite being a quick eat, making focaccia is far from a speedy process. It requires long leavening times between each step which range between 10 minutes and two hours. We take you to one of the oldest bakeries in Genoa, Antico Forno della Casana, where experienced baker Ivan Sacchi shares his tips for making the perfect Genovese focaccia. <br /><br />Editor's note: This footage was filmed on February 20, 2020.<br /><br />MORE REGIONAL EATS:<br />How French Baguettes Are Made In Paris | Regional Eats<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffgZP-ZKKtI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffgZP-ZKKtI</a><br />How Brie De Meaux Cheese Is Made In France | Regional Eats<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGa4ZJF2Nr8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGa4ZJF2Nr8</a><br />How Traditional Haggis Is Made In Scotland | Regional Eats<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBpBP7NT0rs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBpBP7NT0rs</a><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />#Focaccia #Bread #FoodInsider<br /><br />Insider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.
