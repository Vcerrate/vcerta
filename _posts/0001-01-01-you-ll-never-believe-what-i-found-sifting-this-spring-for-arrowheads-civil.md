{% raw %}I decided to take the kayak to a very impressive spring that I found years ago in North Georgia to do some sifting for Native American artifacts. I found quite a few signs of Indian activity and a bunch of 1800s artifacts, however, the most surprising find was a civil war scabbard tip. I found it after moving several large rocks at the spring mouth. I have a feeling this site will continue to produce for quite a while.
