{% raw %}Searx is based. Comparing it to DuckDuckGo and You-Know-Who-gle there's no contest.

While it check out <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://searx.space">https://searx.space</a> for a list of Searx instances, but you can even run a Searx instance on your own server if you don't trust anyone else.<br /><br />WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lukesmith.xyz">https://lukesmith.xyz</a> 🌐❓🔎<br />DONATE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lukesmith.xyz/donate">https://lukesmith.xyz/donate</a> 💰😎👌💯<br />OR affiliate links to things l use:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6">https://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6</a> Get a cheap and reliable domain name with Epik.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8384069-6G">https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8384069-6G</a> Get a VPS and host a website or server for anything else.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://brave.com/luk005">https://brave.com/luk005</a> Get the Brave browser.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lbry.tv/$/invite/@Luke">https://lbry.tv/$/invite/@Luke</a> View my videos on LBRY.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/smith_5to1">https://www.coinbase.com/join/smith_5to1</a> Get crypto-rich on Coinbase.{% endraw %}
