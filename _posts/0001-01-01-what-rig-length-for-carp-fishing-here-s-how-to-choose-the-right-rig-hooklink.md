{% raw %}Here’s how to choose the right rig / hooklink length <br />🙋‍♂️ When to STOP baiting? 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/7f2yEYx0Cw0">https://youtu.be/7f2yEYx0Cw0</a><br /><br />Choosing the right rig length is a key decision when you’re out on the bank. If you get it wrong, your rig won’t work as intended and you’ll miss chances. There are several factors to consider when deciding on the length of your hooklink such as the type of rig material, the type of lake bottom, type of lead, how you apply bait over your rig or the shape and size of carp you’re targeting. This video covers all you need to consider when choosing the length of your rig and how to fish with different rig lengths. For me, there are 3 types of rig lengths:<br />Short rigs: 4 to 5’’ or 10 to 12cms<br />Medium rigs: 8 to 10’’ or <br />Long rigs: longer than 10’’<br /><br />0:00 Introduction<br />00:17 Short rigs: 4 to 5’’ or 10 to 12cms<br />00:28 How do you measure rig length?<br />01:12 Choice of rig materials<br />01:39 How to fish with a short rig<br />03:31 Carp shapes and sizes<br />05:51 Going from 3’’ to 5’’ rigs<br />06:41 Medium rigs:  8 to 10’’ / 20 to 25cms<br />09:37 Rigs longer than 10’’<br /><br />#matthewcollins #carpfishingexplained<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.frenchcarpandcats.com/">https://www.frenchcarpandcats.com/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/matt.collins.148116/">https://www.facebook.com/matt.collins.148116/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BeausoleilCarp">https://twitter.com/BeausoleilCarp</a><br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/matt_collins_carper/">https://www.instagram.com/matt_collins_carper/</a>{% endraw %}
