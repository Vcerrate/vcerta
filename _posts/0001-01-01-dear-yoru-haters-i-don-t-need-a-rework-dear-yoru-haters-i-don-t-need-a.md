{% raw %}Dear Yoru Haters, I Don't NEED a Rework or Buffs in Valorant. I'm so excited for the Yoru buffs &amp; rework coming up! I'm gonna make so many 200IQ Outplays with these Yoru changes. What did you think of the fake spike drop play? It's one of my favorites. Enjoy this Immortal Yoru Valorant Montage and hit like it helps me out a ton!<br /><br />► Watch me live: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/robertrayhart_">https://www.twitch.tv/robertrayhart_</a><br /><br />► Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/robertrayhart">https://www.twitter.com/robertrayhart</a><br />► Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/robertrayhart">https://www.instagram.com/robertrayhart</a><br />► TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@robertrayhart">https://www.tiktok.com/@robertrayhart</a><br />► Join my Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/w7tTSAh">https://discord.gg/w7tTSAh</a><br /><br />#valorant #yoru<br /><br />Im so excited for the Yoru update Yoru Buffs Yoru Changes coming up! Let me show you my how to play Yoru guide in this montage-type of vid where you can pull some ideas and tricks from. Nothing better than some insane Yoru 200IQ Footsteps Outplaying Immortals &amp; Radiants in Valorant as well. Hopefully you learn how to use Yoru flash lineups more with these clips and are looking forward to the Yoru rework Yoru Update outplays soon.{% endraw %}
