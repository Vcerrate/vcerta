So he presses a button on his phone. It’s a little heart. It’s acknowledgement. <br />It makes him feel good.<br />And that’s fine, so it should. He’s my mate. Thats great.<br />He changes the picture in his profile every now and then.<br />Queens birthday. Come on England. No fuss. No problem.<br />He acknowledges applause for politicians on doorsteps for kicking other people off other peoples doorsteps. And I wince.<br />He applauds.<br />He red raw applauds.<br />He says we are Empire. <br />And God will save us all.<br />In the Empire.<br />Empire.<br /><br />And you’re rubber necking wreckage by the roadside,<br />Beeps and swearing silence the sirens, <br />Get a fucking move on, things to fucking do,<br />Got my work to get to, so fuck you and fuck them too.<br />And you’re working out who done what,<br />Then they scrape em up and the traffic flows, the feeling goes. <br />Weeks later there’s roadside flowers,<br />And your gut takes a hit. <br />Until a fucking little shit cuts you up at the roundabout, <br />makes you late for work by a little bit.<br />And you shout.<br />And you shout.<br />And I shout.<br />I shout.<br />I shout because it’s all I’ve got left.<br />I shout because I’m tired of this shit.<br />This lack of compassion. Governmental hypocrite. <br />Their actions need a reaction and for me this is it.<br />In the Empire. <br />Empire.<br /><br />We live on an island full of poppies and crosses ,<br />Union Jack carrots, flagpoles in the sand, rewritten history, industrial wastelands.<br />The pubs back open so no one cares,<br />As the camera pans to billionaires, <br />high fiving in the crowd, loud and proud.<br />The streets are decorated like VE fucking Day,<br />But migrant kids are too scared to go out and play,<br />As I stand back and watch everyone else fight.<br />Just don’t tell me my fucking rights.<br />Just remember my former imperial might.<br />God save the fucking Queen and hold my pint.<br />In the Empire.<br />Empire.<br /><br />But we didn’t level up, we levelled through.<br />Still the rich get richer so you’re fucked again too.<br />And a new hope, a new haircut, a new fuck all,<br />Won’t tear down imagined blue or red walls.<br />Because we are the Empire!<br />Either death throes or a swan song,<br />But where oh where oh where did it go wrong?<br />So blame the young. <br />Blame the old.<br />Blame foreigners, equality, decency, Labour.<br />Blame Tories,<br />Blame monarchy,<br />Blame history,<br />The lot.<br />Just start by saying you’re sorry,<br />For every fucking thing you’ve got.<br />In the Empire.<br />Empire.{% endraw %}
