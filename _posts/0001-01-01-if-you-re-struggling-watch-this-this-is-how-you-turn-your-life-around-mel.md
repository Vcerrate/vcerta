{% raw %}Learn the 5 ways to get UNSHAKEABLE CONFIDENCE in this FREE training from international bestselling author, Mel Robbins: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3qKyaKt">https://bit.ly/3qKyaKt</a><br />---<br /><br />For all my 20-something (or 30, 40, 50-year-olds too ðŸ˜‰) followersâ€¦<br /><br />This story is for you!<br /><br />Iâ€™m about to introduce you to 23-year-old Mel Robbins. You better buckle up because I was such a train wreck and so out of control during law school, that telling you some of the stories from that period of my life makes me wonder how the hell Iâ€™m sitting in this chair in one piece.<br /><br />For my entire 3 years of law school, I was the definition of self-destructive.<br /><br />You're about to hear stories about ghosting employers, hangovers, cheating, and panic attacks.<br /><br />Iâ€™m telling you these cringey stories to prove a point: If I can change, you can change.<br /><br />Iâ€™m still working on becoming a happier version of myself and personal growth has clearly become somewhat of a small obsession of mine ðŸ˜Š And I think that might be because 3 decades ago I felt terribly alone and had none of the free information and resources that are out there today.<br /><br />If you or anyone that you love is going through a self-destructive streak, please share this video with them. Recognizing that you donâ€™t want to stay stuck is the first step. Once you draw a line in the sand, you can take responsibility for who you become and what happens next.<br /><br />---<br />Subscribe to the channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/melrobbinsâ€‹?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/melrobbinsâ€‹?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />---<br />Get my #1 NEW book, The High 5 Habit, here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://high5habit.com">http://high5habit.com</a><br />---<br />Follow me here:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/melrobbins/â€‹">https://www.instagram.com/melrobbins/â€‹</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/melrobbinsâ€‹">http://facebook.com/melrobbinsâ€‹</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://melrobbins.comâ€‹">http://melrobbins.comâ€‹</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/melrobbinsâ€‹">http://twitter.com/melrobbinsâ€‹</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vm.tiktok.com/ZMdVcc93n/">http://vm.tiktok.com/ZMdVcc93n/</a><br />---<br />Sign up for my newsletter written to YOU at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://melrobbins.com/newsletter/â€‹">https://melrobbins.com/newsletter/â€‹</a><br />---<br />Get three free guides + my Mindset Resetâ€‹â€‹â€‹ program at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://melrobbins.com/mindsetreset/â€‹">https://melrobbins.com/mindsetreset/â€‹</a><br />---<br />Looking for my books on Amazon?
