{% raw %}Next build project is a mini crotch rocket. I had picked up a Hyosung GV250r from the local junk yard and you know I had to use it in a build. So this is going to be a mini crotch rocket powered by the Hyosung GV250r engine v twin engine. It's just kind of a fun, different project I've been wanting to do for years. Even though its a mini bike I wanted to use a more serious engine and get it to perform like a sport bike, which is where it got its mini crotch rocket name. At 28hp and micro bike size it should rip pretty good!<br /><br />Do you guys think this thing will be pretty fast, Let me hear some guesses on speed?<br /><br /><br />check out go power sports for all your go kart needs <br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2sC3WLT">https://bit.ly/2sC3WLT</a><br /><br />ratherBwelding merchandise <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2PF21Vf">https://bit.ly/2PF21Vf</a><br /><br />Follow me on Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rather_bwelding/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/rather_bwelding/?hl=en</a><br /><br />help support me on Patreon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/ratherBwelding">https://www.patreon.com/ratherBwelding</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.epidemicsound.com)">http://www.epidemicsound.com)</a><br /><br />#engine #motorcycle #homemade{% endraw %}
