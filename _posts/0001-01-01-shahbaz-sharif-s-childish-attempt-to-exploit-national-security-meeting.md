{% raw %}Why Shahabaz Sharif was so desperate for a Second Meeting of the National Security Committee to bring out a 2nd Declaration on the Communique/Telegram from Washington? What results he wanted to achieve? Has it worked for him? Why not? What is essential failure in Pakistani communication strtegies? Why no one trusts Pakistan's narrative in the world? How this Declaration has exposed that flawed thinking of Pakistani political and administrative system? <br /><br />Moeed Pirzada, Editor Global Village Space, is a prominent TV Anchor and strategic Analyst.
