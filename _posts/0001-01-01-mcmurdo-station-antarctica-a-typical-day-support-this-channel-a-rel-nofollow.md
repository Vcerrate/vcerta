Summer is in full swing and this place is a beehive of activity. In this video I take you along on an average day... lots of walking around in the wind, a few grumpy people that didn't want to be on camera and prevented me from recording about half my day, and a little bit of me doing my thing at work.<br /><br />Other relevant keywords: Greenland, antartica, 2020, summer, winter, coldest place on earth, vlogging in Antarctica, working in Antarctica, life on ice, life in Antarctica, living in the coldest place, South Pole , ice shelf, latest news. #Antarctica #Arctic #typicalday #notflat #climate #climatestrike{% endraw %}
