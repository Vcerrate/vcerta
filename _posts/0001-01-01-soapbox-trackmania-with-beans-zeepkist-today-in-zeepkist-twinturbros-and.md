{% raw %}Today, in Zeepkist, TwinTurBros and I race against each other in progressively more chaotic races. The twist? The game has us playing as beans driving soapbox cars. This game is pretty much Trackmania with beans and no engines. 10/10. Very underrated.<br /><br />HUGE THANKS to Steelpan Interactive for providing a key for this game.<br /><br />Join the Discord! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/De5hDs9">https://discord.com/invite/De5hDs9</a><br /><br />Follow me on Twitch?
