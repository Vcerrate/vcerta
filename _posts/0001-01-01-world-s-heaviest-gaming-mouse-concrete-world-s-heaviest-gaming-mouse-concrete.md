{% raw %}World’s Heaviest Gaming Mouse (concrete) The first ever gaming mouse / computer mouse made out of SOLID CONCRETE!<br /><br />I'm SUPER surprised with how it turned out and I think this project was my craziest one yet!<br /><br />Twitter - @DashingPrune, follow for free diamonds<br />Current sub count: 421, subscribe or you'll have to use a concrete mouse for the rest of your life (real)<br /><br />I saw a video recently of a YouTuber named Heli3x building a custom gaming mouse out of STEEL which he called the World's HEAVIEST Mouse MOD. As soon as I saw it I knew what I had to do so I built a working mouse out of solid concrete. I ran into a lot of problems but figured it all out and at the end of the video I tested the mouse in a few Minecraft Hypixel duels against my friends DrDwarfy, RaineyX and Halvetone and the results were interesting to say the least.<br /><br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3FCYr4h">https://bit.ly/3FCYr4h</a><br />This video was inspired by Heli3x World's HEAVIEST Mouse MOD (Solid STEEL)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/CI5MnPOrq8U">https://youtu.be/CI5MnPOrq8U</a><br /><br />Not Heli3xs World's HEAVIEST Mouse MOD (Solid STEEL), Model X Superlight | The &quot;PERFECT&quot; Minecraft Mouse!, But I Built The Worlds Heaviest Gaming Mouse!{% endraw %}
