{% raw %}Mom and Dad got STUCK TOGETHER!! new princess store!<br /><br />LET'S BE FRIENDS -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ">https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ</a><br /><br />HEY EVERYBODY!! I've been watching a lot of Disney movies lately and I've seen the princesses sing to their animal friends and I really wanted to try it! So I ran to the trampoline in the backyard and started to sing! A bird was flying by and heard my voice and delivered a note to me saying that there was a princess tea party and I was invited! I needed to get dressed up and I knew just where to go! THE PRINCESS STORE!! I know I can always go there for any special occasion! I ran there as fast as I could and when I got there, there was a surprise! Fairy God Father and Fairy God Mother were stuck together!! They were messing around with magic and it backfired on them! They signed me in and then they started to get me ready! They gave me a fancy dress, fixed my hair, gave me jewelry, and did my make up with magic! It was funny to see them try and do all these tasks while being stuck together! When I was almost done I thought I could help fix them with some magic of my own! Turns out I know some spells and I could help them separate! After I was all done I invited Fairy God Mother to the Tea Party with me to have a blast!<br /><br />my last video - ZOO LAKE Animal Transfer!!
