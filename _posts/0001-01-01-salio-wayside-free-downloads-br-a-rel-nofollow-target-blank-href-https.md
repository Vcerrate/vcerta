DRRSAL007<br /><br />Nowhere's wrong, all I do is go by<br />See this blue turn grey run away as we fly<br />And it's another one lost by the wayside<br /><br />Nowhere's wrong, all I do is go by<br />See this blue turn grey run away as we try<br />But it's another one lost by the wayside<br /><br />Something in my heart that fades to grey<br />Something makes the colours fade away<br />Everytime I turn the news on<br />Can you feel that something's so wrong?<br /><br />Something in the air that's filled with fear<br />Something makes the water taste like tears<br />And don't you tell me that the truth hurts<br />Cos lying only makes the truth worse<br /><br />Nowhere's wrong, all I do is go by<br />See this blue turn grey run away as we fly<br />And it's another one lost by the wayside<br /><br />Nowhere's wrong, all I do is go by<br />See this blue turn grey run away as we try<br />But it's another one lost by the wayside<br /><br />Something makes me fall down to my knees<br />Collapsing in the rubble I can see<br />The death behind the snake eyes<br />The pain behind all the lies<br /><br />Something in my breath that makes me try<br />Something in the hope that makes me strive <br />To lead a generation <br />To our emancipation<br /><br />Walking side by side, we watch our future glide away<br />Try to buy the sky but we must walk the path we've laid<br /><br />Nowhere's wrong, all I do is go by<br />See this blue turn grey run away as we fly<br />And it's another one lost by the wayside<br /><br />Nowhere's wrong, all I do is go by<br />See this blue turn grey run away as we try<br />But it's another one lost by the wayside.{% endraw %}
