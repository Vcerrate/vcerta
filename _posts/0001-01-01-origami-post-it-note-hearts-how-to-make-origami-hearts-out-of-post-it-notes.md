{% raw %}How to make origami hearts out of post-it notes.<br /><br />Kids really enjoy writing or drawing messages inside the hearts.  You could make a jar of things to do post-lockdown, make a prayer jar full of loved ones to pray for, or make a positivity jar full of things you like about yourself. <br /><br />We've made body confidence jars as part of the WAGGGS Free Being Me program.  Fill the jar, and then take one out when you have a bad day to cheer yourself up.<br /><br />For children's church on Easter 6 year A we thought of people we love and filled jars with these hearts to help us pray.  Take a name from the jar and thank God for them, think about the things you love about them, ask God to look after them, and ask God to help you show them how much you love them.{% endraw %}
