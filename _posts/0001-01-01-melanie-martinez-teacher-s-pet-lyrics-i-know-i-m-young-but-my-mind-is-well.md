Tell me that<br />I know I'm young, but my mind is well beyond my years<br />I knew this wouldn't last, but fuck you, don't you leave me here<br />Teacher's pet<br />If I'm so special, why am I secret? (Why am I?)<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />She's feeling like a spider in a cage<br />You liar, you were her desire<br />Now she wants to light you on fire<br />But fuck it, she'll still give you a call<br />And a lighter when you wanna get high<br />And mess around 'til you get numb<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus]<br />She said, &quot;It's for all the right reasons, baby<br />Don't care 'bout grades, just call me your lady<br />If I pass this quiz, will you give me your babies?<br />Don't call me crazy<br />You love me, but you won't come save me<br />You got a wife and kids, you see them daily<br />Don't know why you even need me&quot;<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Teacher's pet<br />If I'm so special, why am I secret?<br />Yeah, why the fuck is that?<br />Do you regret the things we shared that I'll never forget?<br />Well, do you? Tell me that<br />I know I'm young, but my mind is well beyond my years<br />I knew this wouldn't last, but fuck you, don't you leave me here<br />Teacher's pet<br />If I'm so special, why am I secret? (Why am I?)<br /><br />[Bridge]<br />Gimme back my money<br />Didn't learn a damn thing, honey, from you<br />Except how to lie and cheat while inside the sheets<br />Stop calling me your bunny<br />I won't hop and you don't own me<br />Do you? I bet you think you do<br />Well, you don't<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Teacher's pet<br />If I'm so special, why am I secret? (Why am I? Why am I?)<br />Yeah, why the fuck is that?<br />Do you regret the things we shared that I'll never forget?<br />Well, do you?
