{% raw %}The Spring 2022 Haute Couture season has come and gone and here is the first half of our reviews of some of the most talked about shows! We begin with Schiaparelli by Daniel Roseberry, who looked to cosmology for an overall theme, while incorporating elements of 1930s Schiaparelli embroidery throughout. It proved that time and time again Roseberry is one that electrifies the rather boring schedule. Dior by Maria Grazia Chiuri was as unexciting as usual, but it continued her push to make the silhouettes and structure of Haute Couture garments less dramatic. Chanel was a look at the 1920s, a decade that cemented Gabrielle Chanel herself in fashion history.<br /><br />Schiaparelli: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSiXuSU6hjs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSiXuSU6hjs</a><br /><br />Dior: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV0B1Z7v9kY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV0B1Z7v9kY</a><br /><br />Chanel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykYI5iMUwdk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykYI5iMUwdk</a><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEj4uRzynPXEEegNqMnJVw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEj4uRzynPXEEegNqMnJVw/join</a><br /><br />Social Media:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hautelemode/">https://www.instagram.com/hautelemode/</a><br />Personal Style: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hautelemess/">https://www.instagram.com/hautelemess/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/HauteLeMess">https://twitter.com/HauteLeMess</a><br /><br />For business inquiries please contact: hautelemode@ellifyagency.com<br /><br />Video Edited by:<br />Rachel Fritz: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rachelfritz/">https://www.instagram.com/rachelfritz/</a>{% endraw %}
