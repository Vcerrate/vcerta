{% raw %}â–º How BTS Is Holding Back Taehyung!<br />Who wouldnâ€™t want their bias to have the most lines and screen time during performances? Of course youâ€™d want to see their faces 24/7. <br /><br />In this video weâ€™ll know who really deserves to be the center of BTS. <br /><br />When it comes to Kpop groups, there are a lot of things to familiarize yourself with. Group dynamics, leaders, even the membersâ€™ names. Each member has a specific â€˜positionâ€™ in their groups - either theyâ€™re the leader, a vocalist, dancers, or rappers. There are also categories under them like main dancer, subvocalists. The visual of the group and the center are also given to the most attractive and best member. <br /><br />The visual is known to be the member who has the best physical features in the group. In short, theyâ€™re the best looking members in Korean beauty standards. Iâ€™m not sure how they decide on this since a lot of members from Kpop groups are really attractive. Jisoo of BLACKPINK, Irene of RED VELVET, and Cha Eunwoo of ASTRO are some of the most popular visuals. <br /><br />ðŸ’œ Please consider liking the video, it helps a lot ðŸ’œ<br /><br />On Kpop Now we are all about Kpop!
