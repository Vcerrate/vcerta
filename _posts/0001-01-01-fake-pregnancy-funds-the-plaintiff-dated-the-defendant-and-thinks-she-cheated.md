{% raw %}The plaintiff dated the defendant and thinks she cheated on him. He says the defendant told him she was pregnant, and he gave her money to terminate the pregnancy. Then, she showed up with a new weave and said she wasn’t pregnant. He’s suing for his money back. The defendant argues she only started cheating because he cheated first. She’s countersuing because she claims he cut a hole into her mattress with a knife.{% endraw %}
