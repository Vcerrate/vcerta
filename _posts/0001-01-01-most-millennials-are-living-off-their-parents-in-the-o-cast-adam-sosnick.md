He hasn’t always been an authority on money. In fact, he was quite the opposite... Before hitting it big in finance in his thirties, he worked every job under the sun. He was a radio advertising salesman for Clear Channel, a party promoter, a hotel manager, a substitute teacher, a sports agent, and he even did standup comedy. While this life had a lot of perks, the reality was that he was making NO money.<br /> <br />In 2006, eager to start making serious money, Sos got an entry-level job at a financial firm as a cold-caller. After a few years of putting his nose to the grindstone and learning the ropes of the finance trade, Sos got promoted to VP of Sales and began to rack in serious money. Despite the financial world around him crumbling in the 2008 Great Recession and people going from making millions to losing their jobs overnight, Sos’s net worth skyrocketed. Seeing what was happening around him led him to recognize the SAVE THAT MONEY mantra.<br /> <br />Sos started a new project to wake young people up when it comes to money. He incorporated his high profile friends and influential financial connections to show that spending money is not that cool, and it’s all about #SaveThatMoney. And then what do you do with that money? You save to invest. Invest in appreciating assets, yourself, and helping people around you.<br /> <br />Email: adam@valuetainment.com<br /> <br />#SOSCast #ValuetainmentShortClips{% endraw %}
