{% raw %}Yes, dear viewer, I used a slightly click-baity title for this video. HOWEVER, the title also happens to be true, so I don't feel bad about it. The chocolate Tacolate does indeed get a LOT of kills at the beginning of the game, and Swagger doesn't believe him. In fact, Swagger guesses that choco only has half his actual number of kills. O ye of little faith, Swag. Enjoy!  - Beth<br /><br />See choco stream LIVE at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/chocotaco">http://www.twitch.tv/chocotaco</a><br />You can follow his Twitter here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/chocoTaco">https://twitter.com/chocoTaco</a><br /><br />Music: &quot;DuDa&quot; by Ian Post, from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artlist.io/">https://artlist.io/</a><br /><br />Keywords: PUBG gameplay, chocoTaco, #chocoTaco #PUBG #Swagger{% endraw %}
