{% raw %}Question: How would a swale in an arid climate look different from a swale in a humid (temperate) climate?<br /><br />- Usually, swales look pretty similar in whichever climate.<br /><br />- In deserts with well-drained, sandy soil, trees can be planted in the swale because they wonâ€™t likely drown there.<br /><br />- However, fine clays can occur in deserts, and this could hold water too long and cause a problem.{% endraw %}
