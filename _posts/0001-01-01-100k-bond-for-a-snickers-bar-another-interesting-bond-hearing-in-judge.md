{% raw %}Another interesting bond hearing in Judge Rangel’s court…<br /><br />This remix is intended to provide better insight into how our courts and the folks who run them administer justice to the public they serve.  Remember they have to deal with folks who are often having their worst day on a daily basis.<br /><br />This commentary remix work constitutes a fair use of any copyrighted materials under section 107 of the US copyright law.
