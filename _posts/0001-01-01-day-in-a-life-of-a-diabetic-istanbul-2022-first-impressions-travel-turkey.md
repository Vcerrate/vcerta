{% raw %}Welcome to a day in a life of a diabetic in Istanbul, Turkey 2022.<br />In this Istanbul vlog, I share my first impressions of the city and culture, when visiting Istanbul for the first time in 2022. A type one diabetic in Istanbul with all the ups and downs a diabetic suffers from time to time.<br />It starts with the perceived low temperature, which made me freezing on arrival. <br />Another point is the traffic: I think Istanbul is the city of taxis. <br />Also worth to mention are the people in Istanbul. As far as I experienced they are very helpful and friendly. <br />If you are into running, Istanbul is yours as it goes up and down which is nice for exercising. <br />The mosques in Istanbul are absolutely impressive and definitely a must-see; so are the massive bridges connecting the European with the Asian part of Istanbul.<br />A probably unique aspect for Istanbul is the impressive scenery of fishermen standing next to each other on such bridges - it creates an incredible panorama.<br />Overall I can say that Istanbul is definitely worth a visit and that it will not be the last time, I spent some time there.{% endraw %}
