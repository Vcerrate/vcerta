{% raw %}It's nearly SUMMER 2021 which means you have to find the best places to go vacation! This video covers the best places to vacation at in 2021 during the summer.<br /><br />Subscribe for more videos like this!<br /><br />0:00 – Prologue<br />The past year has been ROUGH (to say the least) for the Tourism industry. All over the web, we’ve seen images of places typically teeming with tourists left absolutely empty. But when it's time for a destination more exciting than your desktop screensaver, you’ll want to be ready:<br /><br />0:23 – Yosemite<br />This spot is certainly Yogi Bear and Boo Boo Approved- with one of the tallest waterfalls on the planet and over 700,000 acres of forest and mountains, it’s no wonder Yosemite National Park is known worldwide as an outdoor lovers paradise.<br /><br />1:21 – New Orleans, Louisiana<br />“Laissez Les Bons Temps Rouler” is Cajun French for “Let the Good Time Roll’ and is the official motto of New Orleans. Although the city is known for its annual party of a lifetime - Mardi Gras- this saying can be seen in all aspects of life in New Orleans. From its phenomenal Cajun cooking to its fantastic music, New Orleans is certainly a city of good times.<br /><br />2:10 – Hudson Valley, New York<br />The Hudson Valley is home to not only a poppin’ art and music scene but also world-class dining. It certainly helps that the region is the location of the Culinary Institute of America, where Anthony Bourdain, Cat Cora, Grant Achatz and hundreds of other top-notch chefs all got their snack preparing licenses. <br /><br />3:30 – Memphis, Tennessee<br />According to Billboard Magazine, Memphis is the most commonly referenced city in music - there are over 400 songs written about this desert oasis. Memphis is fit for a king, or THE king- Elvis famously made Memphis his permanent residence. This estate, lovingly named ‘Graceland’ is the most visited private home in all of America second only to the White House.<br /><br />4:37 – Honolulu, Hawaii<br />Honolulu is massive- it has the longest borders of any city in the world. To explore it thoroughly, you’ll need some energy. Good thing Hawaii is the only state that grows its own coffee beans, giving you the nervous speed you need to explore all 100 of Honolulu’s dreamy beaches.<br /><br />5:37 – Scottsdale, Arizona<br />Scottsdale is extremely chill. Even the fire trucks here are mellow- those suckers aren’t even red, they’re a yellow-green. Stop... Please… Fire...? Scottsdale is big on rest and relaxation: it has the highest number of destination spas per capita of any city in the US. In fact, Scottsdale is so big on self-care, its most beloved mayor had a 96% approval rate, and his name was Herb Drinkwater.<br /><br />6:33 – Chicago, Illinois<br />If Scottsdale is too chill for your liking, you might want to visit a city that goes hard. That city is undeniably Chicago. The ‘City that Works’, the ‘City of Big Shoulders’, the city that burnt to rubble in 1871 then got up, dusted itself off and went on to invent Skyscrapers, the telephone, twinkies, the vacuum, the zipper, yellow pencils, the electric dishwasher, the mobile phone, and house music. <br /><br />7:00 – CBTS, California<br />Is a mainland beach vacay more your thing? Head over to Northern California’s cultural hub, Carmel. Historically, the town was populated by artists and writers who fled San Francisco's Earthquake and Fire of 1906. These wimpy creatives made a smart move- today the town has flourished into an intellectual oasis Jam-packed into one single square mile.<br /><br />7:59 – Seattle, Washington<br />Buckle up… your Birkenstocks because Seattle is one hell of a place to get your granola on. Home to the nation’s largest continuously running farmer’s market, Pike Place, the city has no shortage of fresh produce, local goods, and wholesome hipsters. Many of America’s most beloved bands were formed in Seattle.<br /><br />9:05 – Salem, Massachusetts<br />Head to Salem any time of year to get your freaky fix. Salem has three different museums alone; The Salem Witch Museum, the Witch Dungeon Museum, the Witch History Museum, not to mention the oldest cemetery in the country. The town has been the filming set for several October favourites, including Hubie Halloween, Hocus Pocus and Bewitched.<br /><br />Sources:<br />Yosemite: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thefactsite.com/facts-about-yosemite/">https://www.thefactsite.com/facts-about-yosemite/</a><br />New Orleans: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hotels.com/articles/ar015491/top-15-fun-facts-about-new-orleans/">https://www.hotels.com/articles/ar015491/top-15-fun-facts-about-new-orleans/</a><br />Hudson Valley: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-hudson-valley_b_5548819">https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-hudson-valley_b_5548819</a><br />Memphis: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.memphistravel.com/travel-professionals/tips-guided-tours">https://www.memphistravel.com/travel-professionals/tips-guided-tours</a><br />Scottsdale: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://christymooney.com/9-facts-scottsdale-arizona-didnt-know/">http://christymooney.com/9-facts-scottsdale-arizona-didnt-know/</a><br />Hawaii: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.50states.com/facts/hawaii.htm">https://www.50states.com/facts/hawaii.htm</a><br />Seattle: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://travelingwiththejones.com/2014/09/03/42-fun-facts-about-seattle-washington/">https://travelingwiththejones.com/2014/09/03/42-fun-facts-about-seattle-washington/</a><br />Salem: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelelbird/salem-massachusetts-facts-witch-trials">https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelelbird/salem-massachusetts-facts-witch-trials</a><br />Salem: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thetravel.com/salem-massachusetts-spooky-fascinating-facts/">https://www.thetravel.com/salem-massachusetts-spooky-fascinating-facts/</a><br /><br />#TheTraveler #Summer2021Vacation #BestVacationSpots{% endraw %}
