We'll start with an overview of &quot;what is a resource&quot; and understand the difficulties of managing resources in modern programming. Next, we will overview a few solutions suggested in the software development world, and analyze their pros and cons.<br /><br />We will then deep dive into C++'s suggested solutions, including smart pointers, and learn how to combine them in our code. Finally, we will discuss RAII from a design perspective, and how to apply a user-defined RAII solution to your code.<br /><br />At the end of the talk you'll be familiar with resource management in software applications in general, and have the toolbox for applying it to your C++ project.<br /><br />This talk will assume knowledge of topics presented in: &quot;Back to Basics: Pointers&quot;, &quot;Back To Basics: Special Member Functions&quot;<br /><br />---<br />Inbal Levi<br /><br />Inbal Levi is an embedded software engineer with a passion for high performance.<br />She is a director at ISO C++ foundation, co chair of Library Evolution, the chair of SG9 (Ranges group) of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG21 (the C++ Standards Committee) and of the ISO C++ Israeli NB, and one of the organizers of CoreCpp conference and user group. <br /><br />---<br />Videos Filmed &amp; Edited by Bash Films: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.BashFilms.com">http://www.BashFilms.com</a><br /><br />YouTube Channel Managed by Digital Medium Ltd <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://events.digital-medium.co.uk">https://events.digital-medium.co.uk</a><br /><br />The CppCon YouTube Channel Is Sponsored By:<br />JetBrains : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://jb.gg/cpptools">http://jb.gg/cpptools</a> <br />SonarSource:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sonarsource.com/">https://www.sonarsource.com/</a>{% endraw %}
