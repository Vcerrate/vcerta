{% raw %}J. Krishnamurti - Brockwood Park 1978 - Seminar 1 - The art of questioning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Q: How can one be a light to oneself?<br /><br />Most of us are slaves, either to religious concepts, beliefs and symbols, or to some kind of experience, to institutions and images. One is caught in a routine, which prevents freedom.<br /><br />How can I understand the depth of myself without understanding how the mind has become dependent? Do you question the way you live your life - why you think this, why you do that, why you have certain reactions? Do you question the whole thing?<br /><br />Can I differentiate the word from the fact? How can one approach something without any knowledge? How do I actually approach a problem? Can we find out the right way of questioning so that intelligence can arise?<br /><br />---<br /><br />This channel is managed by the Krishnamurti Foundation Trust​​, UK​, and by the Krishnamurti Foundation of America.<br /><br />The role of the foundations was described by Krishnamurti when he said,​ ​'The foundations will see to it that these teachings are kept whole, are not distorted, are not made corrupt. They will not give rise to any sectarian spirit in their activities... nor create any kind of place of worship around the teachings or the person.​'​<br /><br />We maintain extensive archives of Krishnamurti's original works and all four Krishnamurti foundations are actively engaged in the publication of material in various forms.<br /><br />Our videos contain thousands of subtitles in more than 25 languages, translated by volunteers from all over the world. If you would like to help us with translating subtitles, please contact us at digital@kfoundation.org<br /><br />For more information about J.
