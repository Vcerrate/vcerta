{% raw %}#cricutcreated<br /><br />What can you do with Cricut Maker? What does it cut? What projects can you make?<br /><br />I'm so excited to be partnering with Cricut in today's video! I get so many questions about my vinyl cutting machines and I love using the Cricut Maker for all my farmhouse signs and vinyl projects. There are literally hundreds of projects you can make and this video shows you the basic features of this ultimate cutting machine. We also make a couple of easy, beginner friendly projects!<br /><br />This post contains affiliate links and I may be compensated if you make a purchase after clicking on my links.
