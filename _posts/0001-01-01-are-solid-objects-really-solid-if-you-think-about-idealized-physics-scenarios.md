{% raw %}If you think about idealized physics scenarios, &quot;frictionless vacuum&quot; or &quot;ignore air resistance&quot; may come to mind, but  another even more ubiquitous mechanical approximation is the so-called &quot;rigid body approximation&quot; where solid objects are said to be perfect geometric shapes that don't deform at all when force is applied. For a LOT of classical mechanics and mechanical engineering, it's a fantastic approximation, but like all approximations, eventually it breaks down. Today I'm demonstrating a failure of the rigid body approximation by asking &quot;When you apply a force to one edge of an object and it starts moving, does the rest of the object actually lag behind? and if so, by how much?<br /><br />Hope you enjoy the experiment!<br /><br />Music in this video:<br />I Dunno by grapes is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ccmixter.org/files/grapes/16626">http://ccmixter.org/files/grapes/16626</a>{% endraw %}
