{% raw %}In this film, My friends and I blindly take on the harsh Australian desert in search for the best waves of our lives.<br /><br />Freshly 18 and out of school we hit the road with minimal knowledge of where we will go. All we hoped for was to eventually end up on the west coast. Nothing could have prepared us for what fate had install for us. <br />PUMPING WAVES, ANGRY FARMERS, BROKEN FOURBY'S. <br /><br />If you are a young takka fresh outta school. Save your pennies, pack the camping gear, and set off for an adventure of your life. Trust me, more memories will be made on the road with your mates than in schoolies in Byron bay. <br /><br />Thank you to <br />Holly Murphy for filming and primarily editing the film.<br /><br />Thank you to the bands who kindly let us use your music.<br />The BEEFS - I'm a country member<br />The BEEFS - Punchin<br />Fleet Street Sounds - HOTEL IN THIRROUL <br /><br />SHORT SOUNDS<br />Tupac - California love<br />Funkadelic - Maggot brain<br />Michael Kiwanuka - Cold Little Heart<br />Flume - You Know<br /><br />Thank you to Billabong for keeping me warm in the Adventure Division equipment and Graphene wetsuits. <br />Big thanks also to Lost Surfboards for the amazing desert quiver.<br />And thank you to the rest of my sponsors for supporting me.{% endraw %}
