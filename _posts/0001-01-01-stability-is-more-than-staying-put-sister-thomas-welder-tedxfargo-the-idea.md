{% raw %}The idea of living with the same people in the same place for a lifetime is called foolhardy by some, and stability by others. While it's not very appealing in our mobile society, those who choose stability, will tell you that it frees them to be fully present to others and to the world. They believe that community is worth the sacrifice of connecting with others and committing to serve.    Sister Thomas Welder, a native of Bismarck, North Dakota, and a member of the Benedictine Sisters of Annunciation Monastery, has served the University of Mary as teacher and administrator since the 1960â€™s. She is committed to fostering servant leadership development in students and colleagues through living mission and core values.  This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
