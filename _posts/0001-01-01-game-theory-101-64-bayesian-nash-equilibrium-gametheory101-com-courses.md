{% raw %}gametheory101.com/courses/game-theory-101/<br /><br />In games of incomplete information, a BNE is a set of strategies, one for each type of player, such that no type has incentive to change his or her strategy given the beliefs about the types and what the other types are doing. Essentially, we are generalizing Nash equilibrium to situations where there are multiple types and uncertainty about which one is actually playing the game.{% endraw %}
