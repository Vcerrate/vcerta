{% raw %}This video accompanies #HonorNativeLand—a guide and call-to-action to spread the practice of acknowledgment of traditional Native lands at the opening of all public gatherings. <br /><br />**We call on all individuals and organizations to open public events and gatherings with acknowledgment of the traditional Native inhabitants of the land.**<br /><br />Acknowledgment is a simple, powerful way of showing respect and a step toward correcting the stories and practices that erase Indigenous people’s history and culture and toward inviting and honoring the truth.<br /><br />Visit www.usdac.us/nativeland to: download the Guide with step-by-step instructions for how to offer acknowledgement and tips for moving beyond acknowledgment into action; download #HonorNativeLand signs to print, customize, and post in your community; and take the pledge to commit publicly to practicing traditional Native land acknowledgment.{% endraw %}
