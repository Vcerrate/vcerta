{% raw %}Be prepared just in case SHTF and food and water shortages become a larger and more widespread problem for us all. Don't let them threaten our survival due to greed and red tape. <br /><br />Here I will share a recent visit to my local Aldi as I take a look at their shelves and stock levels. Upcoming videos will discuss prices today and how they compared to months ago as well as where they could be heading in the future.<br /><br />Inflation, interest rates, supply chain nightmares and other factors are all playing a part in our survival. It is our job to be as best prepared as we possibly can be so we aren't left out in the cold, starving, hungry and left for dead.{% endraw %}
