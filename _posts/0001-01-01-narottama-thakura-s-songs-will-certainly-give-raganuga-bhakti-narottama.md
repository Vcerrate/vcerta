{% raw %}Narottama Thakura’s Songs Will Certainly Give Raganuga Bhakti <br /><br />sri caitanya mano ‘bhistam <br />sthapitam yena bhutale <br /><br />This verse has been composed by Srila Narottama Thakura. It is very rare to come across a better and more beautiful glorification of Sri Rupa Gosvami than this verse. Narottama Thakura was a Rupanuga Vaisnava. <br /><br />He published the condensed essence of [Rupa Gosvami’s] Bhakti Rasamrta Sindhu and Ujjvala Nilamani in a small book called Prema Bhakti Candrika. I feel that by reading/singing Narottama Thakura’s songs and his book Prema Bhakti Candrika one will inevitably attain Raganuga Bhakti. If this doesn’t happen, then we should understand that we haven’t been able to comprehend his writings. <br /><br />Try to enter in this realm. Practice sadhana-bhajana day and night. Serve the Vaisnavas. Make yourself one with their foot-dust. Only then will this be attainable. Bhajana is not so cheap! It only depends on the mercy of Sri guru, Vaisnavas and the Lord. <br /><br />Hear the entire katha here- <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/CJKYeNQ8Jck">https://youtu.be/CJKYeNQ8Jck</a><br /><br />-<br />Join on WHATSAPP, YouTube, etc using <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/gaudiya.rasamrita">https://linktr.ee/gaudiya.rasamrita</a> for short videos &amp; daily harikatha by HDG Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Nārāyana Goswāmi Māhārāja in Hindi and English.{% endraw %}
