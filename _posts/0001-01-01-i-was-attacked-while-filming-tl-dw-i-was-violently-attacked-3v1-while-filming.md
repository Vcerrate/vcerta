{% raw %}TL;DW: I was violently attacked 3v1 while filming for a video project, resulting in injury and a broken camera. The video I was working on was paying for students alcohol tickets here in Santa Barbara, California. I was able to track down the attackers. The police were involved, and they referred the case to the district attorney for criminal prosecution. Despite a bounty of inculpatory evidence, the district attorney let the attackers off the hook completely. The names of the 2 known attackers are Peyton Gallagher and William Austin. I will make a follow-up video when I have any updates. I am seeking a lawyer if anyone knows one in Santa Barbara. I am offering a $500/$1,000 reward for information. Sorry I've been gone for so long (again), been dealing with this shit :\.<br /><br />⚖️ Legal Offense Fund: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=ZZ45QCS6C49EN">http://paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=ZZ45QCS6C49EN</a><br /><br />💎 Join: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/whatever/join">http://youtube.com/whatever/join</a><br />📺 Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/whatever">http://patreon.com/whatever</a><br />👕 Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shop.whatever.com">http://shop.whatever.com</a><br />💵 Tip Jar: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=ZZ45QCS6C49EN">http://paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=ZZ45QCS6C49EN</a><br />🎥 Equipment: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amazon.com/shop/whatever">http://amazon.com/shop/whatever</a><br /><br />📘 Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/whatever">http://facebook.com/whatever</a><br />🐦 Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/whatever">http://twitter.com/whatever</a><br />📷 Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/whatever">http://instagram.com/whatever</a><br />👾 Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitch.tv/whatever">http://twitch.tv/whatever</a><br />👽 Reddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://reddit.com/r/whatever">http://reddit.com/r/whatever</a><br /><br />🕘 TIMESTAMPS:<br />0:00 Introduction<br />0:16 Attacked while filming<br />0:29 What I was filming<br />0:38 Isla Vista location context<br />1:09 Previous give back type content<br />1:43 Paying for students alcohol ticket example clip<br />3:22 The night of the attack<br />3:35 Getting establishing shots<br />3:43 Filmed so many times in Isla Vista<br />4:08 The attackers approach me<br />4:27 Getting recognized<br />5:13 Attackers get aggressive<br />5:25 Confused?
