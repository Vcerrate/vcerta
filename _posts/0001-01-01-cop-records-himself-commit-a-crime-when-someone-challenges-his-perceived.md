McCullough<br />of the<br />Mesa Arizona Police department<br />arrests Spittin Cobra Copwatch while he’s in public and standing on a sidewalk. This officer is clearly not used to having his authority challenged, and it shows by his own actions.<br /><br />Let’s not forget this Officer abandoned his original call for service to make an unlawful arrest. That seems very targeted and retaliatory in nature in my opinion.<br /><br />McCullough also stated to the suspect that cobra doesn’t have a job. <br /><br />The lapses in body cam footage goes against police policy as well as an in ability to remain impartial while on duty. This officer lacks the emotional fortitude to be a public servant, but yet here he is.<br /><br />Cobra is currently in court for this OBVIOUSLY illegal arrest. <br /><br />Crazy right?<br /><br />This is the kind of officer that makes everyone around him look bad. Why do they feel like they can behave like this? This officers conduct became criminal in nature the moment he made contact with my friend while he was recording their activity.<br /><br />This police officer needs to be fired in my opinion, you can’t retrain someone like that…<br /><br />This video is specifically for news, Documentary and education only, please contact a lawyer for legal advice.<br /><br />———————-<br /><br />2nd Channel-<br />I don’t answer questions:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/IDon%E2%80%99tAnswerQuestions">https://youtube.com/c/IDon%E2%80%99tAnswerQuestions</a><br /><br />—————————<br /><br />The Direct D Merch Store:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://my-store-b8adb7.creator-spring.com">https://my-store-b8adb7.creator-spring.com</a><br />Merch Creator:<br />The Gilbert Bystander,<br />Channel Link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/TheGilbertBystander">https://youtube.com/c/TheGilbertBystander</a><br /><br />———————<br /><br />**FAIR USE**<br /><br />Copyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.<br /><br />Fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringing. <br /><br />Non-profit, educational or personal use tips the balance in favor of fair use. <br /><br />FAIR USE DEFINITION:<br /><br />(Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use)</a><br /><br />Fair use is a doctrine in the United States copyright law that allows limited use of copyrighted material without requiring permission from the rights holders, such as for commentary, criticism, news reporting, research, teaching or scholarship.  It provides for the legal, non-licensed citation or incorporation of copyrighted material in another author’s work under a four-factor balancing test.  The term “fair use” originated in the United States.  A similar principle, fair dealing, exists in some other common law jurisdictions.  Civil law jurisdictions have other limitations and exceptions to copyright. <br /><br />U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE- FAIR USE DEFINITION<br /><br />(Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html)">http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html)</a><br /><br />One of the rights accorded to the owner of copyright is the right to reproduce or to authorize others to reproduce the work in copies or phonorecords.  This right is subject to certain limitations found in sections 107 through 118 of the copyright law (title 17, U.S. Code).  One of the more important limitations is the doctrine of “fair use”.  The doctrine of fair use has developed through a substantial number of court decisions over the years and has been codified in section 107 of the copyright law. <br /><br />Section 107 contains a list of the various purposes for which the reproduction of a particular work may be considered fair, such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.<br /><br />————<br /><br />I don’t answer questions • First Amendment • Cops • Police • Cop Watch • id Refusal • Audit<br /><br />#Lawsuit #phoenix #Arizona #cops #police{% endraw %}
