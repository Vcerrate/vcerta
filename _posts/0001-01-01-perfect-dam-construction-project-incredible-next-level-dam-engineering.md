{% raw %}This Amazing Video Is About How A Hydroelectric Power Plant Or Dam Is Built In China &amp; Turkey. In The Last Decades Flood Have Caused Some Of The Biggest Damages In Recorded History. Engineering &amp; Science Trie To Solve Such Problems By Even Killing Two Birds With One Stone. China's &amp; Turkey's Energy Megaprojects Matter To Us All. A Dam Is A Mega Structure And One Of The Most Expensive Megaprojects, Where At The Beginning Dozens of Dump Trucks Dumped Rocks To Cut Off The River Or Stream To Hold Back Water. People Have Used Different Materials To Build Dams Over The Centuries. Ancient Dam Builders In Mesopotamia Used Natural Materials Such As Rocks Or Clay For Mini Dam Construction Mostly For Farm Land Irrigation Purposes. Modern Dam Builders Use Modern Materials Like Steel And Concrete, And Use Amazing Industry Machines, Extreme Heavy Equipment, Big Dump Truck Machines, Incredible Next Level Technology, Pouring Concrete For Dam Construction Machinery, And Some Of The Biggest Cranes In The World And Solving The Problem: How Dams Are Built Extremely Fast And Are Truly Mega Projects Beyond Compare Only A Few People Have Ever Seen. Manmade Dams Create Artificial Lakes Called Reservoirs. Dams Are Not Useless Megaprojects By Any Stretch Of The Imagination. Dams Are Important Because They Provide Water For Domestic, Industry, And Irrigation Purposes. The Biggest Dams Also Provide Hydroelectric Power Production And River Navigation. Dams And Their Reservoirs Provide Recreation Areas For Fishing And Boating. They Help People By Reducing And Preventing Floods. You, Will, Be Surprised To See How This Perfect Dam Construction Project Was Made By Incredible Next Level Engineering In One Of The World's Most Extreme Construction Sites In China &amp; Turkey. It Will Serve The People In Their Everyday Life By Providing Electricity, Jobs And Tourism Money. <br /><br />Yusufeli Dam – Turkey  Expensive Megaprojects<br /><br />The Yusufeli Dam is on the Çoruh River near Yusufeli in Artvin Province within the eastern Black Sea region of Turkey. With a height of 270 m (886 ft) from its foundation and 223 m (732 ft) from the river's thalweg (the lowest point of the river bed), The Yusufeli is a megaproject without a doubt. It will have a crest length of 490 m (1,608 ft) and a crest width of 15 m (49 ft) while being composed of 2,900,000 m3 (102,412,533 cu ft) of concrete. On February 26, 2013, the foundation stone was laid, and the dam's opening date was initially set to May 29, 2018. As of 2018, the expected opening date was delayed to 2021. When completed, Yusufeli Dam will be Turkey's tallest dam and the fifth tallest dam in the world. <br /><br />Baihetan Dam - China<br /><br />The Baihetan Dam is a large hydroelectric dam on the Jinsha River, an upper stretch of the Yangtze River in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, in the southwest of China. The dam is a 277 m tall double-curvature arch dam with a crest elevation of 827 m, a width of 72 m at the base, and 13 m at the crest. It is considered the last large hydropower megaproject in China to be completed since a series of projects starting with the Three Gorges Dam, the third largest dam in China, and the fourth in the world, in terms of dam volume. Actual construction started in 2017. The reservoir started filling in April 2021, on June 28, 2021, the Baihetan Dam began generating hydroelectricity, when the project's first extremely powerful water outlets - turbines started operating. The 3 rd. turbine followed in July, and the 4 th. in November. The facility will generate mini hydroelectricity with 16 extremely powerful water outlets - turbines, each with a generating capacity of 1.0 GW, taking the generating capacity to 16,000 MW. In terms of generating capacity, it will be the second largest hydroelectric power plant in the world, after the Three Gorges Dam.<br /><br />You Will Miss Out If You Don't Watch This Perfect Japan Water Bridge Construction Project: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXSktoZu_BI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXSktoZu_BI</a><br /><br />Few People Have Ever Seen These Amazing Anti-Flood Gadgets &amp; Smart Flood Control Technology: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwCsHiCfl9I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwCsHiCfl9I</a><br /><br />Perfect DIY House Building in 10 Days Step By Step!
