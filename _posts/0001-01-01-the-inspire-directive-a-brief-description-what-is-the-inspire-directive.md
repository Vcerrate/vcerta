{% raw %}What is the INSPIRE Directive?<br /><br />Through the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE), the European Union has created common standards to facilitate the exchange of information and data between the local, regional, national and European or international levels and thus support integrated policy decision-making at all levels of government. INSPIRE is a set of EU and national legal acts and their coordinated implementation.<br /><br />By implementing INSPIRE, Member States, the Commission, and the European Environment Agency are adopting innovative and interoperable data management practices that greatly improve the consistency, availability and re-use of spatial information. The infrastructure will improve decision making in support of environmental policies, and of policies that have an impact on the environment.<br /><br />This video provides an overview of why INSPIRE was needed and what types of spatial data are covered by INSPIRE.  <br />url: inspire.ec.europa.eu{% endraw %}
