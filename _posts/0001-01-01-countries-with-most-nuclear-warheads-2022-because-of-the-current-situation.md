{% raw %}Because of the current situation I decided to create a data visualization video on the state of nuclear weapons throughout the world. I not only show the numbers of nuclear weapons but also some of the devices and their destructive power. Some of these tests and devices include:<br /><br />1945: It all started with the Trinity nuclear test in Alamogordo, New Mexico<br />1949: The Soviet Union conducts its first nuclear test, RDS-1<br />1952: The United States detonates the first hydrogen bomb, &quot;Ivy Mike&quot;<br />1953: The Soviet Union detonates their first hydrogen bomb, RDS-6<br />1954: Castle Bravo was a 15 megaton nuclear test by the US at Bikini Atoll<br />1961: Soviets detonate a 50 megaton bomb, Tsar Bomba<br />1962: The US conducts a nuclear weapons test in space, Starfish Prime<br />1970: French military detonates hydrogen bomb in Licorne<br /><br />After the pandemic I expected the world to come together and work on all sorts of solutions to improve this planet, yet here we are on the brink of WW3.{% endraw %}
