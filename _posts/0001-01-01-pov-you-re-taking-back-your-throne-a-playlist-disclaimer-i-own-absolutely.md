{% raw %}Disclaimer: I own absolutely NOTHING in the video, all I did was compile and edit songs that fit the aesthetic. All the credits go to their rightful owners.<br /><br />This is part four of the kingdom series! It’s quite a sight to see it end, since it was the first series I’ve ever worked on (on this channel, at least) <br />(I take requests as well, so feel free to suggest!)<br /><br />Storyline:<br />     It’s about time you took action. After you had declared war, the corrupt empire’s defenses had been on their toes—but that didn’t stop you from penetrating their high walls and locked gates. With the mere willpower you had to retake what used to be yours, you charged into battle without a second thought.<br /><br />Songs:<br />0:00 - Wolves (by Sam Tinnesz ft.
