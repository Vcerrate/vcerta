{% raw %}Big things come in little packages. For instance, even though todayâ€™s key passage is only one verse, in three sentences it answers the big question of how God wants us to live in the meantime. In order to properly understand this verse, we need to remember something as believers. A follower of Jesus is someone who has responded to the gospel. The gospel is that Jesus died for our sin and was physically raised from the dead. If we repent of our sins and place our faith in him, we will be saved, forgiven, receive eternal life, and have a relationship with God. What a lot of Christians fail to understand is that is where the gospel starts, not where the gospel ends. The gospel not only tells us how we are to relate to God; it then tells us how we are to relate to others. In other words, there is a vertical appropriation of the gospel that is to be followed by a horizontal application of the gospel. Jesus set a great example of what this looks like during His time on earth. He literally came to seek and to save that which was lost, but when they were hungry, He fed them. When they were thirsty, He gave them water to drink. When they were sick, He healed them. When they were hurting, He touched them. With that in mind, what are we to do in the meantime?{% endraw %}
