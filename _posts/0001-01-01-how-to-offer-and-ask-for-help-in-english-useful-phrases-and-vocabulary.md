Welcome back! <br /><br />It is a generally accepted fact, that when we offer people help, we feel good about ourselves. A real win-win situation, where everyone benefits. Let’s take a look together at the different phrases that we can use. Let’s start with some phrases for offering help to someone: <br /><br /> Do you need some help? <br /><br />May I offer my assistance? <br /><br />Can I help you? <br /><br />Let me assist you. <br /><br />Would you like some assistance? <br /><br />What can I do for you today? <br /><br /> This is how we can reply to the offer in a positive way: <br /><br /> If you wouldn’t mind. <br /><br />I’d really appreciate that. <br /><br />Yes, that would be great. <br /><br />Thanks, much obliged. <br /><br />That’s very thoughtful of you. <br /><br />If you are sure it’s no trouble. <br /><br /> And this is how we can refuse the offer in a polite way: <br /><br /> No thank you, I can manage alone. <br /><br />Don’t worry, I can do it. <br /><br />That’s very kind, but I’m okay. <br /><br />Thank you for offering, but it’s okay. <br /><br />No, don’t worry. Thanks for offering. <br /><br />No, don’t bother. It won’t take long. <br /><br /> Of course, maybe we need to ask for assistance. These are the phrases we can use: <br /><br /> Would you be so kind and help me for a moment? <br /><br />If it’s possible, may I ask a favour? <br /><br />Could you spare a few minutes to assist me? <br /><br />Is there any chance you could help me? <br /><br />Could you give me a hand? <br /><br />Would you mind helping me out? <br /><br />Here are some positive and negative responses to those requests: <br /><br />(Positive) <br /><br />Okay, no problem. <br /><br />Of course. My pleasure. <br /><br />Sure, how can I help? <br /><br />(Negative) <br /><br />I’m afraid, I’m rather busy at the moment. <br /><br />Well to be honest, I’ve got no time. Sorry. <br /><br />I’m sorry, but I don’t think I can help you. <br /><br />We hope that these phrases have offered you some help. Let us know in the comments section below.
