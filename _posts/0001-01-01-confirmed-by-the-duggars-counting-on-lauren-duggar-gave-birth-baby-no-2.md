{% raw %}Source says the couple has given birth to their second child. Keep in mind that this is from a source and has not been confirmed by the Duggar family themselves, so we don’t know if it’s true.<br /><br />On the Duggar Data page on Tumblr, someone submitted an anonymous post about Josiah and Lauren Duggar welcoming another baby to their family. The user writes, “I saw a very recent picture of Josiah and Lauren with a baby carrier in front of them so I suspect Siren #2 is here, probably why they skipped Jer’s wedding.”<br />#{% endraw %}
