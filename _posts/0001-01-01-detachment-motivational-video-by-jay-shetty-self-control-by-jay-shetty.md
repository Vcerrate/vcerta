We do not own the clips and music we use in most cases. Our understanding is that it is in correlation to Fair Right Use, however given that it is open to interpretation, if any owners of the content clips would like us to remove the video, we have no problem with that and will do so as fast as possible. Please message us on YouTube or Facebook if you have any concerns.<br /><br />We believe these videos are fair use because: <br /><br />They are transformative in a positive sense, we take clips from various sources to help create an atmospheric feeling that will help people in hard situations in their life. <br /><br />We also do not wish to use the heart of any piece of work that would perhaps decrease the market value of the original content, if anything we hope to promote the content so that people can reach out and subsequently increase the market value. <br /><br />Lastly these videos are to educate people in an entertaining fashion. Given these are very short videos, the short parts we use within them act as a catalyst to further reading.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE LEGAL OWNER OF ANY FOOTAGE OR AUDIO YOU CAN CONTACT US FOR IMMEDIATELY REMOVAL OF THIS VIDEO<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />THANK YOU ALL !<br /><br />Jay Shetty Motivational Videos | Impact Theory Jay Shetty | Jay Shetty Inpirational Video | Clarity Motivation | Jay Shetty Interview | Jay Shetty Videos | Detachment By Jay Shetty{% endraw %}
