{% raw %}Why men lead the romantic interactions but it is women who do the choosing.<br /><br />In this video coaching newsletter I discuss an email from a guy who has only read my book, 3% Man, once, but says I contradict myself when it comes to men leading and women being the ones who choose which men to be in a relationship with. What he’s really looking for is justification for pursuing women to lock them down to a commitment because he is too impatient and controlling. <br /><br />“In the courtship, it’s the man’s job to lead the woman to where he wants to go. If he is sure of himself, his vision of where he wants to go and is pursuing a plan to make it happen, she will feel safe and comfortable enough to trust his leadership and follow and support him. When it comes to relationship commitments, it’s better to let women bring up exclusivity when they feel emotionally ready, because most men are too impatient and in a rush to lock a woman down. This often leads to men chasing women right out of their lives.” ~ Coach Corey Wayne <br /><br />Click the link below to read the article “Men Lead.
