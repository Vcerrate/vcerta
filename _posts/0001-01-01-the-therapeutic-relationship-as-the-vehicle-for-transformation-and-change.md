{% raw %}Title: The Therapeutic Relationship as the Vehicle for Transformation and Change<br /><br />Presenter: Dr. Edward Teyber, Dr. Faith Holmes McClure<br /><br />Dr. Edward TeyberDescription: In this engaging and highly interactive lecture, Drs. Teyber and McClure will discuss ways in which the therapeutic relationship can be facilitative to client engagement and success in treatment. The presentation will draw heavily upon material found in Teyber and McClure's highly acclaimed book, Interpersonal Process in Therapy: An Integrative Model. Attendees will learn a model wherein the therapist-client relationship is a core and primary component of the treatment process. The relationship can provide clients with a &quot;corrective emotional experience&quot; enabling them to develop their own voice and begin to think, feel, and behave differently and with more flexibility to significant others in their lives. Teyber and McClure will frequently rely on role-playing client presentations to powerfully illustrate this integrative model.<br /><br />Faith Holmes McClureBios: Dr. Edward Teyber is professor of psychology, director of the psychology clinic and president of the Foundation Board of Directors at California State University, San Bernardino.
