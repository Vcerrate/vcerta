{% raw %}In this English video lesson I will teach you about gifts, when we give them, and how we buy them. You will learn all of the English words and phrases for the celebrations, occasions, and holidays where we buy gifts and give gifts. I'm sure you have the same traditions in your country, but I thought it would be worthwhile to help you learn a bit more English when it comes to these times of the year.<br /><br />I will even take you with me to learn some English while shopping at a jewelry store where I buy a gift for my daughter.<br /><br />In this English lesson I will go over: typical times we give gifts, how we buy gifts, how we give gifts, etc.<br /><br />I hope you learn a lot of English during this lesson. Thanks for watching!<br /><br /><br />‚åõ Remember:  Always watch the video three times.  Twice today with English subtitles on, and once tomorrow with the English subtitles off.  This will reinforce the English you have learned!<br /><br />--<br /><br />‚úÖSEND ME A POSTCARD:<br /><br />Bob the Canadian<br />P.O.
