{% raw %}*I do not encourage anyone to enter culverts, unclog anything, or enter flooded areas as it can easily become deadly without the proper training*<br /><br />I unclog drains for fun in my spare time (I have been trained in culvert inspections for years with private co.) and I am osha trained.<br /><br />Exploring anything abandoned can be dangerous or deadly without experience. I don't encourage anyone to enter any abandoned structures. Not only is safety a concern, but often times its illegal, and when possible I seek out permission from the owner or local police. I simply go to document its history before it's gone forever and I leave things the way I find them. I only take pictures and only leave footprints. I assume all the risks and responsibility before doing this. Please don't attempt to do this on your own. There could be nails, asbestos, falling concrete, soft floors, animals, or other hazards.
