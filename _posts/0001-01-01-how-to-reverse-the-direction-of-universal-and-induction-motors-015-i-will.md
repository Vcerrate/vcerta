{% raw %}I will show you how to reverse your motor for clockwise or counter clockwise rotation. This is a followup video to how to wire motors including universal motors, DC motors, Induction motors and more...<br /><br /><br /><br />Link to video about Centrifugal Switches<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-j6PhthXJY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-j6PhthXJY</a><br /><br /><br />Link to my favorite videos on motors and how they work. I have watched these videos many times and they are still good. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpL0joqJmqY&amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpL0joqJmqY&amp;t</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07uXnc1C5CA&amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07uXnc1C5CA&amp;t</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-WQZ1SGqi4&amp;list=WL&amp;index=10&amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-WQZ1SGqi4&amp;list=WL&amp;index=10&amp;t</a><br /><br />TPAI<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1-klL3B9LU&amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1-klL3B9LU&amp;t</a><br /><br /><br />Defining shaft direction<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/60605536/defining-the-direction-of-motor-rotation?dti=0&amp;lc=en-US">https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/60605536/defining-the-direction-of-motor-rotation?dti=0&amp;lc=en-US</a><br /><br /><br />Corrections and omissions<br /><br />At time 11:15 I say the speed controller added resistance to the circuit. I thought it was a variable resistor like a rheostat. Actually it uses a Triac to rapidly switch the power on and off.<br /><br />If you want to chip in a few bucks to support more content like this, please visit my patreon page. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/jeremyfieldingsr">https://www.patreon.com/jeremyfieldingsr</a><br /><br />My website www.jeremyfielding.com<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jeremy.fieldingsr/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/jeremy.fieldingsr/?hl=en</a><br /><br />Final Note:<br />PLEASE UNDERSTAND...I receive hundreds of messages on all platforms (email, Facebook, comments etc) asking for advice, and help with projects. At this volume, I simply can't do one on one advice. I have tried to help enough times to know I should never assume I have all the relevant information in the message, and even basic questions can produce a lot of followup questions. I do read all the questions, and if I get the same ones over and over I make videos about it to help lots of people. Thanks for your understanding on this.{% endraw %}
