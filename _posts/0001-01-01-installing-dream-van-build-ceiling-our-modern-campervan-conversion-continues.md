{% raw %}We cut it close with this video (omg the exhaustion is hitting us both by the end, lol!), but this has to be the coolest van ceiling we're capable of making! This van build is flying now and we're so so so proud &amp; excited about how it's going! Thanks for joining us for Season 3, Episode 2!<br /><br />Check out our new website!!! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ladiandmargaret.com/">https://www.ladiandmargaret.com/</a><br /><br />In Season 1 of the van build, we stripped off the old DPD stickers, rust-proofed the entire van, painted it our favorite matte grey color, redesigned the cab, planned our van's design / layout, created our epic water tanks, built our custom panorama roof windows, installed new wheels, &amp; installed an insulated floor! PHEW! Building a home is something else!<br /><br />Then Season 2 of the van build rolled around, and with our workshop's renovation behind us, it got TECHNICAL! We built a 47 degree solar tilt (1kW of solar power!), made custom seat bases &amp; installed our custom seats, we took security to the NEXT level, breaking down our 12 incredible layers of security, wired everything our tech-dependent home will need, created the BEST insulation we've ever seen in a campervan (check out our video on campervan insulation &amp; cold camping insulation), installed our own custom security cameras, framed the ceiling, AND created our peak-a-boo curtains. WOW!! We are beyond ready to be off grid in this Ducato van home! ‚ù§Ô∏è<br /><br />Now Season 3 of the Van Build is kicking off in our brand new space, allowing us to work regardless of the weather or time of day! This is going to be the most exciting phase of this van life build yet!!<br /><br />Interested in our custom leather apron? <br />Email us at ladiandmargaret@gmail.com (include &quot;apron&quot; in the subject line) and we'll put your name down for pre-order. This is a high-quality, one-of-a-kind item for $149, and is hand-crafted here in the village. We're not sure how many we're going to make going forward, so for now this will be a limited batch order with free shipping included. It's an awesome product we know this van build community would love, and would make an incredible gift for any DIYer! Plus, if you're already living in a van, what better tool belt for all the vanlife upkeep? üòâ<br /><br />Save yourself hundreds of dollars &amp; hours of research time!<br />Van Conversion Parts List: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/LMVanBuildPartsList">https://bit.ly/LMVanBuildPartsList</a><br />Van Design Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/VanDesignCourse">https://bit.ly/VanDesignCourse</a><br />Van Bundle (Parts List, Design Course, all 3D Models, Water Tank dimensions) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/VanDesignBundle">https://bit.ly/VanDesignBundle</a><br /> <br />Take a look at our powerful eBikes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mysuperebike.com/">https://mysuperebike.com/</a> <br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3Fzc1W6">https://bit.ly/3Fzc1W6</a> <br /><br />Follow along on INSTAGRAM @curlyhaircamping <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/curlyhaircamping/">https://www.instagram.com/curlyhaircamping/</a><br /><br />Installing DREAM Van Build Ceiling!
