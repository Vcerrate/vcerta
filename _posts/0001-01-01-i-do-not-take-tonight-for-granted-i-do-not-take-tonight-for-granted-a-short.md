{% raw %}I Do Not Take Tonight For Granted, a short film, filmed on an iPhone 13 entirely over the course of three days and edited in two nights.<br /><br />Songs Used: Time Of The Season, Stay With You, Cocktail Hour, Kind Of A Party, Dark Star, Shining Star, Fireside, Snowy Peaks pt II, Allégro, Good Gig In The Clouds, Ponderous Days, and First Dream.<br /><br />Credits to the locations used, cars driven, extras filmed, randoms on the street, and the 2016 Oscars.<br /><br />This was edited over the course of 2 days, from May 25th to May 27th, but primarily from 8pm to 10am during the night and morning of May 26th and 27th to turn it in on time. This is a school project but it's the best school project you'll ever see. No script, just a basic timeline and story to run on. Can you tell? Don't answer that.<br /><br />Attributions:<br /><br />Dark Star by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br /><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100534">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100534</a><br /><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a><br /><br />I hope you enjoy, and I hope this doesn’t get taken down due to copyright issues like my other videos have.
