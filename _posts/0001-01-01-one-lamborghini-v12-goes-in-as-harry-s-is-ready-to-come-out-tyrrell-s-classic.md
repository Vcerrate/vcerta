{% raw %}Fresh from the success of the last video featuring two Lamborghini Countach, one of course belonging to Harry Metcalfe, it's high time for another workshop catch-up to see where those two cars are up to along with a host of other fine examples currently occupying the workshop.<br /><br />Iain begins with the black Countach from the US, outlining what's been discovered about the fuel systems and catching up with Pete about the electrical/ ignition systems, both of which have conspired to prevent the car from firing up.  From there we move on to the Citroën SM that featured a few episodes ago to see the fabulous work that Craig has done restoring the seats, along with a repair for the window mechanisms that threw up a surprise connection to an Italian icon!<br /><br />We then move on to the 350GT, the 5th-ever production Lamborghini that is on the home stretch of its restoration, before catching up with Craig to discuss his work on that car along with the Citroën SM.  And Craig has obviously been a busy-bee because more of his work features in the next subject, the fibreglass 308 that has featured in previous catch-ups and whose chassis is happily now of a much sturdier standing than when it arrived!<br /><br />On the day of filming, a V12 lovingly rebuilt in-house is ready to be refitted into a Lamborghini Espada.  This provides a nice contrast to the final preparation work for Harry's Countach ready for the engine and gearbox to come out.<br /><br />00:00 - Introduction <br />00:39 - Black Countach Fuel System<br />01:38 - Black Countach Ignition System with Pete<br />05:26 - Citroën SM Interior Restoration<br />07:28 - Lamborghini 350GT Restoration<br />08:30 - 350GT Interior with Craig<br />10:22 - Fibreglass Ferrari 308 Restoration<br />11:53 - Lamborghini Espada V12 Engine Refit<br />13:45 - Harry's Countach<br />14:57 - Outro<br /><br />Thank you once again to everyone for the overwhelming reception of these videos and for all the support of likes, subscribes and wonderful comments.  <br /><br />This video was brought to you by Aston Lark - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.astonlark.com/tyrrellsworkshop">https://www.astonlark.com/tyrrellsworkshop</a><br />Filmed and edited by Whipp3dCream - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whipp3dcream.com/">https://whipp3dcream.com/</a><br /><br />Interested in purchasing a classic car?
