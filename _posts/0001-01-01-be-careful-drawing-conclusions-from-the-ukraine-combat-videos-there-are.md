{% raw %}There are a lot of videos coming out of Ukraine, leading to a lot of opinions. Not to be a wet blanket, but I caution that these are merely small data points, and normally will only permit conclusions supported by that one snippet, not larger trends. [Edit. Dear God, people, this is a video about critical thinking. It's not about who I think is going to win or who I hope is going to win (Ukraine, for the record). Listen carefully to my words: saying &quot;Not everything unpleasant is a war crime&quot; is NOT the same as &quot;Russia is committing no war crimes&quot;.]<br /><br />Merchandise (The carousel below seems dodgy)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://the-chieftains-retail-hatch.creator-spring.com/">https://the-chieftains-retail-hatch.creator-spring.com/</a><br /><br />Public facebook page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheChieftainArmor">https://www.facebook.com/TheChieftainArmor</a><br /><br />Financial donations:<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/The_Chieftain">https://www.patreon.com/The_Chieftain</a><br />Direct Paypal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/thechieftainshat">https://paypal.me/thechieftainshat</a>{% endraw %}
