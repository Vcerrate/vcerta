{% raw %}A guided healing meditation for healing the body, getting well, reducing inflammation and pain. Ideal for anyone suffering inflammation within the body, chronic pain, ibs, disease, illness or simply to rejuvenate the body.<br /><br />Here is a link to the sleep version of this meditation.  Listen in the evening as you go to sleep <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/tagsEcS9K9c">https://youtu.be/tagsEcS9K9c</a><br /><br />Improving your life by gaining strength and health and leaving behind worries and anxieties about illness and disease and discomfort.<br /><br />Use this recording to improve digestive health, reducing the symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).  Studies have shown that hypnotherapy/guided meditation is particularly effective as a treatment for positively relieving the symptoms of IBS. This hypnosis recording has been designed to strengthen the mind-gut connection to encourage deeper and improved physical health.<br /><br />We believe healing is possible through positive observation and appreciation.  We experience what we think about so an increased focus of positive intentions and appreciation is paramount.  When you feel good and healthy you will find everything improving, in all areas of your life. <br /><br />We encourage you to listen to this recording daily for at least 1-2 weeks and even more often if you prefer. Repeated listening can help you strengthen your own positivity and deepen the behaviours you would like to experience on a daily basis. <br /><br />Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.progressivehypnosis.com.au">http://www.progressivehypnosis.com.au</a> for downloads and offline access.<br /><br />Follow us on Facebook: ►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/progressivehypnosis/">https://www.facebook.com/progressivehypnosis/</a><br /><br />Follow us on Instagram: ►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/progressivehypnosis/">https://www.instagram.com/progressivehypnosis/</a><br /><br />Try some of our other positive guided meditations and hypnosis: ► <br />Lose Weight while you Sleep ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4n7ExMd45cxg2pOGV4ZRgnjsmPwx2hFA">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4n7ExMd45cxg2pOGV4ZRgnjsmPwx2hFA</a><br />Heal while you Sleep Meditations ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4n7ExMd45czhcfO0LSW6jjqu_KyliLMQ">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4n7ExMd45czhcfO0LSW6jjqu_KyliLMQ</a><br />Deep Sleep Guided Meditations ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4n7ExMd45cxLYkguaoI8ZZyVGmA0Nl7-">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4n7ExMd45cxLYkguaoI8ZZyVGmA0Nl7-</a><br /><br />Do not listen to this recording whilst driving or operating machinery. <br /><br />This recording is in no way a replacement for any prescribed medication; nor is it intended to contraindicate or supersede any medically diagnosed conditions. The author accepts no responsibility or liability for use of this material. <br /><br />All hypnosis is self hypnosis and you will only take on the suggestions that you choose. Therefore, we cannot guarantee your results or the permanency of any results. Because all hypnosis is self-hypnosis, you are always in control. If you choose to accept the suggestions presented in this session, you can rest comfortably knowing that you are the one safely in control of your own positive results.<br /><br />We recommend you listen to all our recordings via headphones. <br /><br />Progressive Hypnosis uses positive voice suggestions, relaxing background music to encourage the very deepest state of relaxation so positive inner change can occur and to remove negative blocks.  We have created this with the idea of self guided healing in mind.<br /><br />P.S.
