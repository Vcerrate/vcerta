{% raw %}This lovely little creature is a cuterebra larvae found in the eye of an outdoor cat. Cuterebra larvae are parasites that can infect dogs and cats. They come from rabbit bot flies and can infect animals when they pass through an area that has bot fly eggs. The eggs hatch in response to the heat of the animal. These little things can cause simple infections just under the skin of the infected animal or can even travel and cause neurological signs. <br /><br />Note: All Videos Here On This Channel Have Been Allowed To Be Uploaded On It(except Commentary, it's Original And Added By Me With My Own Voice)<br /><br />Love Animals?
