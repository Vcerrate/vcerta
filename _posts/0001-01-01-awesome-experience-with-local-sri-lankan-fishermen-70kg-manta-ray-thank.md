{% raw %}Thank you to everyone that supports me, everyone that’s been here since day one and everyone who’s jumping in the band wagon. I really appreciate it, all I want to do is live nomadically moving around the world and bringing you guys along with me.<br /><br />I never know how much to thank you guys because I don’t want to bore you but I can’t hold it in today… YOU ARE ALL SO AWESOME. <br /><br />I’ll be updating my patreon page every other day from now on as I’m trying to grow it so if you’re interested in seeing more personal videos about myself and my travels then come on over and subscribe. Tonight I’ll be filming my LIFE STORY. I’ll be explaining why I am like I am and where I come from. It’s not something I’m ready to put out on public YouTube videos so if you more interested then click the link below and subscribe. It really helps me out. <br /><br />I’ve just uploaded a short Sri Lankan fire dancing video so go check it out. <br /><br />Peace and love. <br /><br />LINK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TrueBudgetTra...">https://www.patreon.com/TrueBudgetTra...</a><br /><br />**ALL of my patrons have access to anything I put on patreon, the different tiers are purely so you can decide how much you can afford each month to support us.
