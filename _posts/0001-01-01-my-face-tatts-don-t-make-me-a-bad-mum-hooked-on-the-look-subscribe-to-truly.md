Valerie, 34, from San Diego, CA, got her first tattoo when she was 14 years old and now has dozens of designs covering her body - including nine tattoos on her face. The mum of two is a painter herself and sees her tattoos as an expression of art. But her tattoos, especially those on her face, have attracted a lot of negative attention; Valerie gets judgement from online trolls and strangers when she is out and about, with people often saying she is not setting the best example to her three-year-old and 15-year-old sons. However, Valerie is proud of her tattoos and is determined to carry on with more ink on her body - including her face. Valerie told Truly: “I would describe my look like a modern-day Harley Quinn. It’s a look I am comfortable with. It's the way that I express myself.”<br /><br />Follow Valerie here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/valerie_watson_/">https://www.instagram.com/valerie_watson_/</a><br /><br />Videographer: Brandon Hickman<br />Producers: Rafaela Kuznec, Kim Nguyen<br />Editor: Jonny Poole <br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
