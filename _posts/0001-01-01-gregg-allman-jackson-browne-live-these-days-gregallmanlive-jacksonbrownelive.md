{% raw %}#GregAllmanLive #JacksonBrowneLive #TheseDays<br /><br />This video features a live performance of Jackson Browne’s song, “These Days,” by Gregg Allman of The Allman Brothers and Browne, who became friends early in their careers. Browne speaks fondly of Allman, who passed away just after this performance.<br /><br />Written by Jackson Browne, &quot;These Days&quot; was recorded by numerous artists. Browne wrote the song at age 16; its lyrics deal with loss and regret. It was first recorded by Nico in 1967 for her album “Chelsea Girl” and in 1968 by The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band for their album “Rare Junk” and in 1970 by Tom Rush. Nico and Browne were romantically linked at the time of the release of her “Chelsea Girl” album.<br /><br />Gregg Allman recorded a new arrangement of the song in 1973 on “Laid Back,” and Browne recorded the Allman arrangement on “For Everyman” the same year. &quot;These Days&quot; has also been recorded by Paul Westerberg, St. Vincent, Fountains of Wayne, Mates of State, David Allan Coe, Glen Campbell, and Drake.<br /><br />According to Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times, the song has &quot;quietly become a classic&quot; over the years. Pitchfork Media's 2006 ranking of &quot;The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s&quot; placed the Nico version of &quot;These Days&quot; at number 31.<br /><br />Citizen Abels – a production of Four Strong Media™ LLC and The Citizen™ Media Group – is a YouTube show and channel produced and directed by David Abels.
