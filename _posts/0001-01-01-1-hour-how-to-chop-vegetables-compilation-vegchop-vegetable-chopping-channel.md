{% raw %}My life’s purpose is to teach people how to prepare meals that are simple, wholesome, and budget friendly.<br /><br />The audience I want to serve are those who don’t have a lot of skill, time, or money, but want to eat well.<br /><br />I make my videos as if they were for my younger self. I was broke, unskilled in the kitchen and had very little time to devote to cooking.<br /><br />For years I would buy a fridge full of produce, but it would spoil because I didn’t know how to cut it up and cook it. Over and over I would promise myself that I would start cooking and eating healthy, but the cycle of throwing out spoiled, healthy food and snacking on junk seemed like it would continue forever.<br /><br />Then one day I had enough. I remembered my days in the Army where they served three square meals a day in the chow hall. The food was good, healthy, and simple. I wanted desperately to eat that way again, but there was no chow hall anymore.<br /><br />I began to teach myself how to cook. It was a slow process, and I still have a way to go, but I have the knowledge to save someone years of struggle, and my only desire is to pass it along in a practical way.<br /><br />I will roll out my plan in three phases:<br /><br />Phase 1: Start a YouTube channel to teach people how to chop fruits and vegetables (Vegetable Chopping Channel). There are plenty of cooking channels, but not many for chopping, so I feel my time is best spent in this space as I develop my video skills and build an audience.<br /><br />Phase 2: Transition the Vegetable Chopping Channel into a cooking channel. I will teach people how to be self sufficient in the kitchen. Videos will feature recipes from my Mother’s cookbook, kitchen hacks I’ve developed over the years such as a novel knife sharpening technique, how to have matching lids for all of your storage containers, batch meal prep, the bare minimum kitchen tools you’ll need, etc...<br /><br />Phase 3: Open a real cooking school for home cooks, bachelors, aspiring chefs, or anyone who wants to learn to cook better and meet like-minded people.<br /><br />I dare to dream of building a community of people who are interested in learning to cook wholesome meals and sharing their knowledge.<br /><br />My name is Mike.<br /><br />I hope you will join my mission. <br /><br />A greatly appreciated donation will help me deliver better content faster, and to more people.
