{% raw %}Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Australia will be sending armoured vehicles and more financial aid to Ukraine.<br /><br />It comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky gave a joint address to the House of Representatives and the Senate requesting use of Bushmasters. <br /><br />“We’re not just sending our prayers, we’re sending our guns, we’re sending our munitions, we’re sending our humanitarian aid, we’re sending all of this, our body armour, all of these things,” Mr Morrison said. <br /><br />“We’re going to be sending our armoured vehicles, our Bushmasters, as well and we will be flying them over there on our C-17s to make sure they can be there to support.”{% endraw %}
