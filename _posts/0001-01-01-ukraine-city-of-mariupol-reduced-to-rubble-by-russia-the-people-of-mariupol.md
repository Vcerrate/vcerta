{% raw %}The people of Mariupol have not given up their city, but after three weeks of solid bombardment, there isn't much of a city left. Strategically located between Crimea and the eastern part of Ukraine, Russia has essentially leveled the place. Nearly the entire city was reduced to rubble by the invaders. Three-quarters of the population fled, and 100,000 people remain trapped. Amazingly, the Russians have yet to conquer it.{% endraw %}
