{% raw %}Muslim Giving Strangers Free Food in Ramadan During The Coronavirus Pandemic!<br /><br />Muslim Giving Strangers Free Food in Ramadan During The Coronavirus Pandemic! We wanted to make a feel good video where we gave back to the community for the last ten days/nights of Ramadan and for the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19). We also wanted to spread a good message of Islam while doing it. We love doing random acts of kindness and this is one that we wanted to do in Ramadan for the pandemic. Islam teaches us about giving back to the community and helping as many people as you can and we wanted to do just that while also socially distancing and staying safe. Ramadan 2021 is ending and we wanted to make a video where we spread positivity and gave back to the community. We have done similar videos before where we paid for peoples groceries and we always try to give back and do random acts of kindness as often as we can. Ramadan is all about giving back and helping people and we thought this would be a good way to spread knowledge about what Ramadan is and inform people that the month has begun. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar where Muslims fast from dawn to sunset. Ramadan is a holy month of fasting, introspection and prayer for Muslims, the followers of Islam. Fasting is one of the five fundamental principles and pillars of Islam. Each day during Ramadan, Muslims do not eat or drink from sunrise to sunset. They are also supposed to avoid impure thoughts and bad behavior. Muslims break their daily fasts by sharing meals with family and friends, and the end of Ramadan is celebrated with a three-day festival known as Eid al-Fitr, one of Islamâ€™s major holidays. The first day of Ramadan - the holiest month for Muslims - is observed according to the local visibility of the new crescent moon. Ramadan 2021, like many other years, had a differing opinion on what day to start fasting because the moon had not been sighted in some places. The moon sighting is a topic that always has some controversy every year however it is the sunnah of Prophet Muhammed (PHUH) to follow your local masjid. Muslims also refrain from listening to music and try to read and listen to as much Quran as possible. Different Ramadan topics usually trend this time of year including Ramadan 2021, Ramadan Duas, Ramadan Nasheeds, Ramadan Recipes, Ramadan Songs, and more!<br /><br />Business Inquiries: collabs@mustafahussain.com<br /><br />Follow me on Instagram &amp; Twitter: @mustafah<br />Follow Ahmad on Instagram &amp; Twitter: @ahmadatieh{% endraw %}
