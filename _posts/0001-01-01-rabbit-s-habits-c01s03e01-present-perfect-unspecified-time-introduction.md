{% raw %}Introduction: Welcome team to Season 3 of Rabbit’s Habits. So far, we have studied the present, past and future. This week we will start to see the present perfect which is like a bridge between the past and the present.<br /><br />I’ve prepared this class as an introduction to the topic. You will not learn everything instantly so I’ve divided it in a way that will last the whole season. We are starting with the regular verbs that all end in (-ed) in their past and past participle form. {I’ll explain this in class}<br /><br />Warm up: Write down a movie you have watched, a place you have travelled to, and a song you have listened to.<br /><br />I have watched _____<br />I have travelled to _____<br />I have listened to _____<br /><br />Goal of the Week: Start familiarizing ourselves with the present perfect.<br /><br />Main Objective: Answer the following questions.<br />1. Where have you travelled to? What was your favorite?<br />2. What are 3 movies you have watched? Which did you watch last?<br />3. What are 3 songs you have listened to many times? Do you still listen to them?<br />4. What sports have you played? Have you ever competed?<br />5. Where have you studied? How old were you?<br />6. Where have you worked with? What are you working with now?<br />7. Have you ever moved? Where did you move to?<br />8. Have you ever started something then regretted it? What happened?<br />9. Who has helped you the most? What have they helped you with?<br />10. What have you always wanted to do, but haven’t? Why haven’t you?<br /><br />Challenge of the Week: A Life So Far<br /><br />I try to live in the present as much as possible. Sometimes it’s not easy. We need to make plans and often we often remember things from the past at unexpected times. This week we will be making a checklist of our accomplishments. Make a list of things you have done. I always like the number 10, but write as many as you can.<br /><br />Examples<br />I have lived in 3 cities.<br />I have played many different video games like Mario Kart, Mortal Kombat, Halo, Urban Rivals, DotA, Fire Emblem.<br />I have read hundreds of books. I’ve read many books multiple times.<br />I have started my own business.{% endraw %}
