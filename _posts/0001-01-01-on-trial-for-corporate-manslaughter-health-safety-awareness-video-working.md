{% raw %}Working across Construction, Aggregates and Waste industries we are well aware of the importance of Health &amp; Safety in the workplace. This video aims to raise awareness for company owners/directors and those of you starting out in business to understand the depth of your responsibilities once you employ staff.<br /><br />After a fatality in the workplace in UK it is the Company Director that may be taken to Court and may be charged with Corporate Manslaughter by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Note:  there are other types of legal action that could also be taken.<br /><br />In this video we have created a dramatised fatality scene in the Ashville yard. This is followed by a mock Court scene with Prosecution Barrister Dr Tunde Okewale MBE acting as the Prosecution Barrister holding company director Daniel Louisy accountable for the death of an employee.<br /><br />00:00 intro<br />00:17 Dramatised Fatality in Yard Scene<br />02:48 Mock Crown Court with Prosecution Barrister<br />23:38 Judges Verdict<br />24:50 Summary<br />26:51 outro<br /><br />:: The University of Law ::<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.law.ac.uk">https://www.law.ac.uk</a> <br />@The University of Law <br />IG @u_law<br /><br />:: Dr Tunde Okewale MBE ::<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://urbanlawyers.co.uk">https://urbanlawyers.co.uk</a><br />IG @tundeokewale<br /><br />:: Health and Safety Executive ::<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/fatals.htm">https://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/fatals.htm</a> <br />@Health and Safety Executive <br /><br />#HealthAndSafety  |  #WorkplaceSafety  |  #CourtCase<br /><br />:: ASHVILLE ::<br />waste management  |  aggregates  |  concrete  |  construction<br />IG @thisisashville<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ashvilleaggregates.com">http://ashvilleaggregates.com</a><br /><br />:: DANIEL LOUISY ::<br />IG @daniellouisy{% endraw %}
