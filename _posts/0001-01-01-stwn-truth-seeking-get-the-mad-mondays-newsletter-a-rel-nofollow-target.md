It's a village, not a club, and we plan to be here a while: like, till the end of the world. So calm down: remember that rest is from God: and thank him for Saturday mornings on which there is no better thing to do than ponder life in his universe and... chill.<br /><br />This week, the Mad Christian and Meridith speak about:  <br /><br />Should I root out bad motivations when it comes to Christian discipline and devotion?<br />Should I move away from my city?<br />Lutheran position on speaking in tongues<br />Apocryphal parts of Esther?<br />Climate change and the end of days<br /><br />The opinions expressed on the Stop the White Noise are those of RevFisk and Meridith, but sometimes also God. Studies show that learning to tell the difference greatly enhances your viewing experience. <br /><br />If you need help, the Holy Bible stands ready to assist you, as (hopefully) does your local, trustworthy pastor.<br /><br />To join our Discord community online, request an invitation link through <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://revfisk.com/contact/">https://revfisk.com/contact/</a><br /><br />Find everything else at revfisk.com <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://revfisk.com/">https://revfisk.com/</a>{% endraw %}
