{% raw %}The Chevrolet Bolt EUV (which is kind of different from the Bolt EV) is affordable and packed with tech and features like available Super Cruise handsfree driving. 2023 models come with a significant $6,300 price cut. Starting at $28,195 (yes, with destination) it’s one of the best deals in the electric vehicle world. Tom Voelk checks out a fully loaded Premier model with heated and vented seats, a punchy Bose sounds system and range of 247 miles.<br /><br />Note- I'm not getting deep into the battery recall program with this video but Bolt owners know that there's a replacement program going on. In some cases this is a buy back, where GM purchase the car back from the consumer.. My neighbors have a 2018 Bolt EV and their new pack gives them a significant boost in range. <br /><br />Get Free Real-World Pricing And Invoice Info! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://quotes.driven.ws">https://quotes.driven.ws</a><br />SUBSCRIBE HERE ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SUB2DRIVEN">http://bit.ly/SUB2DRIVEN</a><br /><br /><br />TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS BY CLICKING THE “BELL” BUTTON AFTER SUBSCRIBING! <br />FOLLOW TOM VOELK ON TWITTER ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TomVoelk">https://twitter.com/TomVoelk</a> <br /><br />About Tom: Tom Voelk is an award-winning automotive contributor to The New York Times.
