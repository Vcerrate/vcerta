There is a point where you have to trust in yourself…” [16:06]<br /><br />“If I cannot master myself, forget about the outside world. So, it always has to begin with you.” [25:56]<br /><br />“You're not going to own my response to you. I'm going to own it. That's why, I do for me not for you.” [33:50]<br /><br />“When you assert yourself as an authority, in body posture, and voice in speech, and how you present yourself, people are less likely to mess with you.” [58:10]<br /><br />“If you're not dealing with any stress, if you're not dealing with adversity, you're not dealing with obstacles, then when something does happen, you're not going to know what to do.” [1:15:36]<br /><br />“When you avoid conflict, you don't know what to do when real conflict shows up [...] repetition in creating habits that are healthy, so that when things happen, you default to those habits.” [1:26:57]<br /><br />“When you first meet people, and you're trying to figure them out, let them do the talking. Ask open ended questions, and then that way, let people guide you and give you the information you need rather than guessing.” [1:42:32]<br /><br />Follow Evy Poumpouras:<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.evypoumpouras.com/">https://www.evypoumpouras.com/</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/evypoumpouras">https://twitter.com/evypoumpouras</a> <br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evypoumpouras/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/evypoumpouras/</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/evypoumpouras/">https://www.facebook.com/evypoumpouras/</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/evypoumpouras/">https://www.instagram.com/evypoumpouras/</a>{% endraw %}
