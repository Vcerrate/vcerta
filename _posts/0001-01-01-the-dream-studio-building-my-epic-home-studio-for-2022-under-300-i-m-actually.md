{% raw %}I'm actually blown away by the result! I can't believe this cost less than $300 USD haha!<br /><br />I've always wanted to build a home music studio that made me feel inspired to write and produce more music, but I was also scared of the prospect of spending thousands of dollars endlessly upgrading my home studio equipment and getting custom built acoustic treatment installed only to find out that I needed more expensive acoustic panels and bass traps to get the right sound. So I started to do some research. I've seen many people build their own acoustic panels for their music studio and have seen how effective custom built bass traps can be, so how hard could it be to build my own acoustic treatment? Well actually, a little harder than I originally thought, BUT it's still not all that difficult and it's so much more affordable than I expected! The results actually blew me away and the process of building a music studio myself was really rewarding and made appreciate acoustics even more than I already did. <br /><br />‚úÖ I hope you guys enjoy the video.
