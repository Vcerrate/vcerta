{% raw %}What if kingdoms formed in Minecraft? In this video, we investigate this question by simulating civilization in the medieval times with peasants and vikings!<br /><br />Join My Discord! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/bcBHkZ2">https://discord.com/invite/bcBHkZ2</a><br />Events Streamed on Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/MagicGumLIVE">https://twitch.tv/MagicGumLIVE</a><br />Patreon for Maps and Event Priority! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/magicgum">https://www.patreon.com/magicgum</a><br /><br />#Minecraft #Simulation #Civilization #Sociology #Medieval <br /><br />100 players are dropped into different biomes with a unique specialty to encourage trade and diplomacy between civilizations. We’ve also added proximity chat to simulate realistic human interactions. In true medieval fashion, lawless vikings are scattered throughout the land, putting pressure on nations to cooperate.  Each region tests how a society would develop with their own strengths and weaknesses. Will people form an empire or will the regions plunge into anarchy?<br /><br />This is Simulating Kingdoms in Minecraft, a variation of 100 Players Simulate Civilization in Minecraft! Everything from the primitive caveman beginnings to allied kingdoms fighting to the death will be covered. This will truly test the theories of what if everyone was trapped in minecraft, with more nuanced interactions.<br /><br />A lot of planning went into this video!
