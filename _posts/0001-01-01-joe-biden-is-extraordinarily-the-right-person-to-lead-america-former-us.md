{% raw %}Former US Ambassador to Australia Jeff Bleich touted President Joe Biden’s Inaugural address as a “great celebration of American values” and praised Joe Biden as “extraordinarily the right person” to lead America at this time. <br /><br />“I thought it was a great celebration of American values and he really spoke to the moment, which is, Americans are exhausted from a pandemic, from all of the challenges that have come from it, from an erratic form of leadership, and from a stoking of fuels of division within our country,” Mr Bleich said.<br /><br />“They’re ready to come together; they’re ready to start fighting this common enemy together. <br /><br />“I think he’s extraordinarily the right person for this time.<br /><br />“He’s extraordinarily experienced, he’s skilled, he’s strategic, but most of all, he’s got a wonderful temperament which reflects American values.”<br /><br />Mr Bleich said Americans were impressed with the restraint of President Joe Biden and his strength, insofar as he maintains a moderate view and doesn’t play to the media. <br /><br />“I’m confident that the Joe Biden we know will be the Joe Biden who will govern us,” he said.{% endraw %}
