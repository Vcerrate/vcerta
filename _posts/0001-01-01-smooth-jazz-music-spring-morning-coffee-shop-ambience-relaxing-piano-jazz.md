Wishing you a day filled with exciting and wonderful moments.<br /><br />‚úç Storyline:<br />‚ÄúToday is the weekend I continue to visit the orphanage and play with them, then I go to a familiar cafe down the street. Entering the shop today has a clear difference, perhaps it is wearing a shirt with a vibrant spring color. Flip open the diary and book and write the stories of the children at the orphanage that I am visiting today. I put pen to write down the feelings of a bygone day. You know, documenting what a day goes by is magical. I often keep a diary of the days I visit them because I have always believed that human memory is limited. At some point we will all forget what happened. At the end of a long day, I love to sit back in this quiet space, read my favorite book and tell my story. That will make your fatigue disappear. Only one meaningful day left‚Ä¶‚Äù<br />The story above is fictitious and written for entertainment purposes only!<br /><br />‚û°Ô∏è Please Sign Up!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bitly.com.vn/haku23">https://bitly.com.vn/haku23</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è Band produced by Cozy Coffee Shop<br />‚û°Ô∏è Nice to see you again on my Cozy Coffee Shop channel üòç<br /> I really enjoy the jazz tunes and the hot cups of coffee next to it.
