{% raw %}At the end of a meal at a restaurant, who is supposed to pay? In this video, I will teach you some of the traditions we have for paying the bill in North America. Who pays? Do you really have to leave a tip? If so, how much? I’ll also teach you the vocabulary we use when discussing the bill, including: it’s my treat, I’ll cover the bill, it’s on me. Take the quiz after the lesson to practice what you’ve learned: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.engvid.com/paying-at-a-restaurant-vocabulary-culture/">https://www.engvid.com/paying-at-a-restaurant-vocabulary-culture/</a><br /><br />Keep the conversation going with these videos!<br />Easy English Conversation: Talk about food! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EjYp7oDMM6s">https://youtu.be/EjYp7oDMM6s</a><br />Stop saying I'M SORRY: More ways to apologize in English <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/qJiWCzULfco">https://youtu.be/qJiWCzULfco</a><br /><br />In this video:<br />00:00 Introduction <br />00:39 &quot;Bill&quot; or &quot;check&quot;? <br />01:06 How to ask for the bill at a restaurant <br />01:50 Who pays? <br />04:31 Who pays for dinner dates? <br />07:00 Arguing over the bill! <br />07:42 &quot;my treat&quot; <br />07:55 &quot;cover&quot; <br />08:08 &quot;on me&quot; <br />08:49 What about the tip? <br />10:44 Review{% endraw %}
