{% raw %}Republican Senator Marco Rubio, along with Republican Senator Steve Daines, were two of many members of the House and Senate that were on a recent call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, and they were all asked to keep the call quiet in order to keep Zelensky safe. Rubio and Daines instead decided to tweet out images of themselves on the call, a direct violation of the requests that had been made. They endangered his life just to get more social media engagement, as Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins explains. <br /><br />Link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/rubio-daines-share-photos-zelenskyy-call-asked-not-ukraine-rcna18841">https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/rubio-daines-share-photos-zelenskyy-call-asked-not-ukraine-rcna18841</a><br /><br />Become a member today!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join</a><br /><br />Support us by becoming a monthly patron on Patreon, and help keep progressive media alive!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire">https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire</a><br /><br />Find our merchandise at Teespring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store">https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store</a><br /><br />Spread the word!

It was made by a Ukraine ambassador prior to this call beginning, that nobody was to share this information on social media. They were worried about Zelensky's safety. So far, the man has already survived three different assassination attempts from Russia. So they're like, hey, we're trying to protect our president. They're trying to kill him. Please don't tweet this out. Don't post it on your Instagram pages. I don't think that's too much to ask. Well, apparently for people like Marco Rubio, it was too much to ask, even though they were explicitly asked not to share it. Republican senators Marco Rubio and Steve Daines did exactly that. They shared photographs of themselves talking with Zelensky on Zoom to their social media followers, possibly endangering his life for clicks and likes. That's what they did. Threatening the security of that area of Europe, just to get some likes and retweets on Twitter. That's what Marco Rubio and Steve Daines did.<br /><br />And then of course, when they got called out for it, both of 'em were like, well, hey look, he's fine. Nothing happened. You couldn't tell where he was from what we did. Doesn't matter. You were asked not to do this. Right. Aren't you the party that tells people just comply and nothing bad will happen, right? Don't rock the boat. Just do what you're told here by these people in positions of power. And here you are directly ignoring their requests just so that you can get some followers on, on Twitter. This is beyond pathetic behavior from these two Republican senators. But Zelensky wasn't exactly asking for, you know, money and food. Zelensky of course, we gotta talk about this, was asking the United States to join in and, and declare a no fly zone over Ukraine. And that folks would basically be a declaration of war. That would be the United States getting involved in a war in Europe. We cannot do that. And I hope that the United States continues to refuse to do that. Because what a no-fly zone would mean, it would be if we implement this, we say you cannot fly over this area, Russian planes come in, they fly over the era area anyway.<br /><br />We would shoot them down or Ukraine would shoot them down or our allies over in Europe would shoot them Down. Once you start shooting down war planes, there's no way to deny it, you're involved in the war. The United States has to continue to stay out of this. We cannot send troops. We cannot send bombs and tanks and planes. We cannot put these no zones up there. We can't, we absolutely cannot. We can continue to support Ukraine. We can continue to put the financial pressure on Vladimir Putin, which unfortunately, as we're seeing is having a direct negative impact on Russian citizens, which is not fair for them. And we gotta figure out a better way to do these kinds of things to where the average citizen isn't the one feeling the squeeze, instead of the guy at the top. But unfortunately that's how economies are designed. Those at the top, they're gonna be just fine. Maybe not the folks having their yachts confiscated over in Europe.{% endraw %}
