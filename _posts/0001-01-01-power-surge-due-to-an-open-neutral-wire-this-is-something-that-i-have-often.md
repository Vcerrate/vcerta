{% raw %}This is something that I have often wondered about. On numerous occasions people<br />have brought me televisions that went bad due to a power surge. On a couple of those<br />occasions it was due to  an amateur electrician disconnecting the neutral wire. This circuit shows the danger of an open neutral, and how it can cause a power surge on some of your outlets.{% endraw %}
