(I mean, how do you even know a risk is calculated? How does one even calculate the risk? Don't worry friend, read on.)<br /><br />An important part of being a smart liquidation reseller (aka pallet flipper) is knowing how to lower your risk when it comes to purchasing pallets. <br /><br />If you have a truck, trailer, and a means to pick up pallets yourself, that's ideal even if you only do it for the first purchase. This way, you are able to look potential sources in the eye and develop deeper relationships more quickly. That's not always possible, so it's still an okay practice to develop relationships online or over the phone. We've done it that way for years, and we have had success with it. <br /><br />Regardless of whether or not you are meeting potential &quot;honey holes&quot; in person or in a virtual setting, you're going to want to make sure you ask a few things before you purchase. These questions are going to lower your risk and increase your chances of having successful pallets.<br /><br /><br /><br /> #Palletflipping #FlippingPallets #Liquidationtips<br /><br />Joe and I are full-time resellers and parents to three beautiful children. We have been reselling for over 5 years now, and we love it! We specialize in purchasing lots and pallets of liquidated goods and selling them online and locally for profit.<br />When we first got married, we dreamed of being able to live a lifestyle where we could spend our time pouring into our children with our love, our time, and our leadership.<br />Reselling has been the perfect vehicle to achieve that goal. We homeschool our children and teach them about life by doing life with them!<br />​Over the years, we discovered that reselling is a great way to achieve financial freedom and make a positive impact on the world, the environment, family life, and more!<br />We want to share what we've learned, our experiences, our successes and our failures with others, so they, too, can achieve their dreams and ambitions too!<br /><br />Want to get started selling Liquidation with little to no money?
