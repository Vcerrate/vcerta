Take some pea seeds and keep them in water for 24 hours till they start germinating. <br />2. Boil some seeds for ten minutes so that their cells die and they stop germinating.<br />3. Put the germinating seeds in flask A and boiled seeds in flask B.<br />5. Insert a thermometer in the mouth of each flask and seal the mouth with moist cotton.<br />6. Moist cotton will keep the seeds moist and also allow air to enter the flask for respiration to take place.<br />6. Note the temperatures on both thermometers of the flask.<br />7. Keep the apparatus for about 4 hours.<br />Observation: The temperature reading in the thermometer put in flask ‘A’ rises but there is no rise in the temperature reading in the second thermometer.(Flask B)<br />Hence we conclude that respiration in the live cells of seeds in flask ‘A’ results in the release of heat.<br /><br />Science Experiments<br />Science Projects<br />Smart Scholar{% endraw %}
