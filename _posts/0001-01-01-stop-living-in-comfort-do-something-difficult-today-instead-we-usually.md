{% raw %}We usually avoid difficulty whenever we can, but I try to do something difficult every single day. <br />In this video, I’ll explain the three main reasons behind why I’ve chosen this approach. <br />And it all starts with the comfort zone.<br /><br />When we're in our comfort zones, we're not pushing ourselves.<br />At the first glance, there seems to be nothing wrong with that.<br />Why would we voluntarily put ourselves in a position of struggle, if we don't have to?<br /><br />But if we only live our lives in comfort, we might be unknowingly doing ourselves an injustice.<br />Hopefully by the end of the video you will be inspired to leave your comfort zone and do something difficult today yourself. <br /><br />Images © Piers Baker www.svgdoodlewhiteboard.com{% endraw %}
