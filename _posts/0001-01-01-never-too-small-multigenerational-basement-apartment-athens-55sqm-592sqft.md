Situated on the bottom floor of a multigenerational building, Ilioupoli apartment is intended as a future home for the familyâ€™s younger children, keeping the family together for longer while allowing them their own spaces. Previously an entirely open concrete room, the architects divided the space by extending the existing enclosed toilet into a full bathroom, adding an entryway partition screen and planter, as well as curtained sliding glass doors to enclose the bedroom.  The home is further divided by colour, with the kitchen featuring a deep maroon laminate, a full size fridge as well as a custom island bench that opens on all four sides for storage. A contrasting bold blue bathroom is visible from the kitchen through a window in the wall between the two rooms that also allows for the flow of light. Division through flexible partitions, colour and materials creates a space that feels larger and more varied than it is, ensuring even basement storage can become a comfortable home.<br /><br />How Masterworks works:<br />Purchase shares in great masterpieces from artists like Pablo Picasso, Banksy, Andy Warhol, and more.<br />-Create your account with your traditional bank account<br />-Pick major works of art to invest in or our new blue-chip diversified art portfolio<br />-Identify investment amount<br />-Hold shares in works by Picasso or trade them in our secondary marketplace<br />See important Masterworks disclosures: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.masterworks.io/about/disclaimer">https://www.masterworks.io/about/disclaimer</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://masterworks.art/nevertoosmall">https://masterworks.art/nevertoosmall</a> <br /><br />#smallapartment #architecture #interiordesign<br /><br />Music: Plant Your Fields by We Dream of Eden<br /><br />Produced by New Mac Video Agency<br />Creator: Colin Chee<br />Director: Nam Tran<br />Cinematographers: Alina Lefa &amp; Xenofon Vardaros<br />Producer: Lindsay Barnard<br />Editor: Jessica Ruasol{% endraw %}
