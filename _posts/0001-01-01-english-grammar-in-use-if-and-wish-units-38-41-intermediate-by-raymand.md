{% raw %}This book is for students who want to help with English grammar. It is written for you to use without a teacher.<br /><br />If and wish<br />UNIT 38 - If I do ... If I did <br />UNIT 39 - If I knew ... I wish I knew<br />UNIT 40 - If I had known ... I wish I had known ...<br />UNIT 41 - Wish<br /><br />The book will be useful for you if you are not sure of the answers to questions like these:<br />* What is the difference between &quot;I did' and 'I have done'?<br />* When do we use 'will' for the future?<br />* What is the structure after 'I wish'?<br />* When do we say 'used to do' and when do we say 'used to doing'?<br />* When do we use 'the'?<br />* What is the difference between 'like' and 'as'?<br /><br />These and many other points of English grammar are explained in the book, and there are exercises on each point.<br /><br />LEVEL.<br />The book is intended mainly for intermediate students (students who have already studied the basic grammar of English). It concentrates on those structures that intermediate students want to use, but that often cause difficulty. Some advanced students who have problems with grammar will also find the book useful.<br /><br />The book is not suitable for elementary learners.<br /><br />How the book is organised<br /><br />There are 145 units in the book. Each unit concentrates on a particular point of grammar. Some problems (for example, the present perfect or the use of 'the') are covered in more than one unit. For a list of units, see the Contents at the beginning of the book.<br /><br />Each unit consists of two facing pages. On the left there are explanations and examples; on the right there are exercises.<br /><br />💪LET'S BOOST OUR ENGLISH SKILLS TOGETHER ✌<br /><br />TO SUPPORT this channel:<br />☕ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/smart.english">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/smart.english</a><br />☕ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/smarteng">https://ko-fi.com/smarteng</a><br /><br />👍 - thumb's up<br />✅ - subscribe to this channel<br />💬 - leave the comments<br />or 🚀 - share the videos<br /><br />Thanks again, and<br />ALL THE BEST  <br />WITH YOUR STUDIES!<br />😉👍{% endraw %}
