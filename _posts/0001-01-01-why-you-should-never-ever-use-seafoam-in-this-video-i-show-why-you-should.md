{% raw %}In this video I show why you should never use Seafoam. I give three reasons right at the beginning. I also give reasons why you SHOULD use Seafoam. Hint: I use Seafoam and in my experience, the stuff works! Also, it's a pretty fun product to use with a super satisfying plume of white smoke after the 'hot soak.' <br /><br />Newest version SeaFoam: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2E8UI0n">https://amzn.to/2E8UI0n</a><br /><br />In this video you'll see me use Seafoam on my 1995 GMC Truck Suburban otherwise known as the GMT-400 or K1500. This truck is the same as the Silverado, Sierra, Tahoe, Yukon and even Escalade. <br /><br />***This channel is for entertainment purposes only! Do not do what I do. Do not take my advice.
