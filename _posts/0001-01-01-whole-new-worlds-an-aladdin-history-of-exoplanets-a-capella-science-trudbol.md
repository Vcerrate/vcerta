fantasy entwined<br />Finding planets except they haven't got one<br /><br />Well they gotta be forming readily<br />When you think about it given we've got nine<br /><br />1 jump<br />A blip in the spectrum<br />1 shift of meters per second<br />1 graph of period power<br />They laugh but I'm not sour<br /><br />Here goes<br />18 months of data<br />Cross &amp; correlate it<br />All I gotta do is run<br /><br />Pish tosh<br />Green men<br />Ah don't mind them<br />If only they'd look closer<br />Would they see a pure void<br />No sirree<br />They'd find out<br />There's worlds galore<br />To see<br /><br />Make way for Pegasi<br />51 Pegasi<br /><br />First was a world<br />Round an old pulsar<br />That's true<br />But the news<br />Is a sun-like star<br />With wobble<br />Too quick &amp; precise<br />To be designed<br />No fluke not a spot<br />If you like it hot<br />You're gonna love this find<br /><br />Pegasi 51b<br />Planet discovered<br />Orbit traced<br />Every 4 days<br />Hot as can be<br />Its order-Jupiter size<br />Was something of a surprise<br />Especially given its star's proximity<br /><br />Pegasi 51b<br />It's a new era<br />To detect<br />Exoplanets<br />Soon there'll be three<br />As planet pulls on its Sun<br />It shifts the stellar spectrum<br />That's how we found 51b Pegasi<br /><br />How'd a planet get so close in orbit<br />Cause I thought you needed ice to form it<br />Did it later undergo some strange migration<br />Star too small to be so long-pulsating<br />And too old to be so quick rotating<br />Is there any other good interpretation<br /><br />This will certainly help with our funding<br /><br />We got your funding<br />We got your funding<br /><br />Got a surface of 1200 C<br /><br />It's treacherous<br />So treacherous<br /><br />If in time this new breakthrough feels mundane<br />Planets are common<br /><br />That's proof<br />Of the truth<br />I've been telling you<br />This is no mean anomaly<br /><br />Pegasi 51b<br />Planet uncovered<br />Round a far<br />Main sequence star<br />Spectral type G<br />We know its mass to be high<br />Half Jupiter by sine i<br /><br />It's 15.61 pc from home<br />And it shakes our faith in how planets are formed<br />And its star is in Pegasus<br />Give it an A and thus<br />Label the planet as b<br />51 Pegasi<br /><br />Plotting Doppler shifts is glacial-pace<br />And that astrometry never prevails<br />But baby you're in luck cause<br />Up in space<br />You got a planet-finder never fails<br /><br />You got the power of statistics now<br />You got a view without an atmosphere<br />So no more nights spent locked up in your tower<br />All you gotta do is wait right here<br />And I say<br /><br />Kepler the planet-searcher<br />Got a dip, no 2, no 3<br />We just measure brightness<br />Plot it out &amp; that's transiting photometry<br /><br />When your stars do this<br />And your curves displace<br />Then your star's got this<br />Transiting its face<br /><br />Then you hit compute<br />And lookie here<br /><br />You get good diameter data<br />From that dip<br />And orbit distance from the length of year<br /><br />Well now we need this tale supported by<br />A ground observer with a good Ã‰chelle<br />We got 2000 planets certified<br />2000 more that only time will tell<br /><br />But let's take em all, plot em out<br />And find out if we're really all alone<br />Is there a rocky world we've found no doubt<br />That orbits in the habitable zone<br />Like home?<br /><br />Kepler the planet searcher<br />Got an Earth 452b<br />Part of a throng<br />40 billion strong<br /><br />There ain't never been a field<br />Clever as the field<br />There ain't never been a field<br />Better than the field they call<br />Exoplanetology<br /><br />I can show you a world<br />A shining shimmering planet<br />Found concealed in the band-shifts<br />Of the closest star in sight<br /><br />I've found hope in the skies<br />And facing wonder I wonder<br />Could the sine wave discovered be<br />A planet fit for life<br /><br />A whole new world<br />A new fantastic point of blue<br />Placed in that narrow zone<br />Where water flows<br />Midway tween cold &amp; steaming<br /><br />A whole new world<br />Its sun a faint, reddish hue<br />Could there be waiting here<br />A biosphere<br />Evolving in this whole new world to view<br /><br />Fathoming a whole new world to view<br /><br />Unbelievable find<br />Indescribable feeling<br />Earthlings someday revealing<br />Through directly captured light<br />A whole new world<br /><br />Don't just stare from a far<br /><br />Though nigh impossible to see<br /><br />Wouldn't close up be bolder<br /><br />Next to its parent's flair<br />If life is there<br />We'll know through atmosphere spectroscopy<br /><br />A whole new world<br /><br />Block the glare of the star<br /><br />A laser starshot to pursue<br /> <br />With a star-shaped occulter<br /><br />Chasing that crazy dream<br />That's always been<br />Of walking in a whole new world with you<br /><br />a whole new world<br />That's where we'll be<br />A thrilling chase<br />A home in space<br />For you and me{% endraw %}
