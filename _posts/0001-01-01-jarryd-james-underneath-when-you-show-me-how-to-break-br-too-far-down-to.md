{% raw %}When you show me how to break<br />Too far down to make it wait<br />Maybe love is a mistake, show me reasons to stay<br />All we gotta do is indicate the wrongs that we make<br />The lines that we take<br /><br />Maybe we were so underneath it the only way to make it will set you free<br />Mmm we were underneath it, ooh ooh<br />Maybe we were so underneath it the only way to make it will set you free<br />Thinking over every feeling oh I gave up under the weight of it<br /><br />Surely we can learn from our mistakes<br />Fix the heart's that we break<br />Loneliness can be the fire that we need to escape, all we need to do is simply find the lives that we make<br />The lines that we take, ooh<br /><br />Maybe we were so underneath it the only way to make it will set you free<br />Mmm we were underneath it, ooh ooh<br />Maybe we were so underneath it the only way to make it will set you free<br />Thinking over every feeling oh I gave up under the weight of it<br /><br />Here she comes<br />Mmm mmm<br /><br />Take me, take me, take me, take me down<br />Take me, take me, take me, take me round ooh Oooh<br />Take me, take me, take me, make me drown again<br /><br />Maybe we were so underneath it the only way to make it will set you free<br />Mmm we were underneath it, ooh ooh<br />Maybe we were so underneath it the only way to make it will set you free<br />Mmm we were underneath it, ooh ooh oooh<br />Maybe we were so underneath it the only way to make it will set you free<br />Thinking over every feeling oh I gave up under the weight of it{% endraw %}
