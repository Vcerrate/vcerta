This new age deception is a naive misinterpretation rooted in self denial that gets disguised as &quot;non-duality&quot;. Just remember that duality is sacred, and is in fact ESSENTIAL for creation. Duality isn't some silly illusion made up by the human mind. Duality is what created the human mind in the first place. God is so far beyond our mortal minds. The very task of trying to understand God is but a fools errand that will lead you to chase your own tail until the end of time. That being said, what we can do is try to understand the Laws that have been put in place and do what we can with the level of our human understanding.<br /><br />I don't usually feel this strong about a philosophical position, but after experiencing some heavy falls because of certain spiritual traps, and observing others going down the solipsism route, I feel like it's almost my duty to at least share valuable knowledge I've learned on my journey. I think it's not only important to learn practical philosophies, but to learn about potential traps, since those are the ones that do the most damage. ESPECIALLY if you think it's for spiritual growth,<br /><br />Again, please do not take my word for it. Discover yourself what is true, and do the critical self-inquiry to weed out the bs. Many of the points in this documentary was borrowed from &quot;The Kybalion&quot; by the 3 Initiates. I highly recommend studying Hermeticism, as it will provide you with profound Truth and wisdom about Natural Law which is practical and verifiable. This is the real deal. None of this new age fluff ;)<br /><br />Thank you to all our Patrons for helping make this documentary possible :)<br /><br />Get 15% OFF TransZen (Mood Enhancement Supplements) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://entheozen.com/tom/">https://entheozen.com/tom/</a><br /><br />ðŸŽ¶Music by Waywell: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/waywell">https://soundcloud.com/waywell</a><br /><br />â–¼ â–½ One Time Donation:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/yourmatetom">https://www.paypal.me/yourmatetom</a><br /><br />â–ºâ–ºSupport this channel and get a FREE 30 day Audible Trial: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/YaHvxM">https://goo.gl/YaHvxM</a><br /><br />â˜› My Amazon Product List: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/influencer20170928256">https://www.amazon.com/shop/influencer20170928256</a><br /><br />â–ºâ–ºSigns Of Spiritual Awakening:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRHvvAelGGI&amp;ab_channel=RAWSpirituality">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRHvvAelGGI&amp;ab_channel=RAWSpirituality</a><br /><br />â–ºâ–ºThe HERO'S JOURNEY - Joseph Campbell<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNPcefZKmZ0&amp;ab_channel=RAWSpirituality">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNPcefZKmZ0&amp;ab_channel=RAWSpirituality</a><br /><br />Contribute captions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UCDlC2yGOv2RfN5W9moPZN1Q&amp;tab=2">http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UCDlC2yGOv2RfN5W9moPZN1Q&amp;tab=2</a>{% endraw %}
