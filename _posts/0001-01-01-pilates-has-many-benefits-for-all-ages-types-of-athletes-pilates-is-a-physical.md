{% raw %}Pilates is a physical fitness program and form of exercise that focuses on the body's core muscles that help keep the body balanced. These muscles are also essential for providing support to the spine. It is especially important that athletes have strong cores so as to perform at their optimal level and to reduce the risk of injury. Pilates also teaches awareness of breath, aligns the spine and strengthens deep torso muscles. The exercises also improve overall flexibility, which can also help to prevent injury.<br /><br />Pilates exercises can be done on a mat, but here at the Sports and Orthopedic Physical Therapy center at Nationwide Children's Hospital, we like to use a machine called The Reformer. This machine can be set up to accomplish all sorts of exercises, as you'll see in the video. It really does help us achieve the most variety of Pilates exercises.<br /><br />For more information about our Sports and Orthopedic Physical Therapy program, or to learn about our other clinics, visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nationwidechildrens.org/sportspt">http://www.nationwidechildrens.org/sportspt</a>{% endraw %}
