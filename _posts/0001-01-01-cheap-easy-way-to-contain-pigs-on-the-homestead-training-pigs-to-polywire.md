{% raw %}#hiddenoakshomestead #homesteading #kunekunepigs<br /><br />We're switching our feeder pig operation over to, and raising KuneKune Pigs. They will take longer to grow out, but the meat quality is supposed to be amazing. We have been working on establishing our breeders and feeders and are moving them into bigger pastures of a wooded area for them to forage.<br /><br />We're a small family farm in the Florida Panhandle. After relocating back home from the Middle East we wanted to build up the most self- sufficient lifestyle possible with our kids, in order to grow as much of our own food as possible. Through raising livestock, tending to a garden, preserving food through canning and fermenting, learning about local fauna for medicinals and wild edibles, we are hoping to encourage others to do as much as possible for themselves through re-learning some of the forgotten &quot;old&quot; skills.<br /><br />If you would like to support our channel, you can use our affiliate links listed below to shop and receive discounts.
