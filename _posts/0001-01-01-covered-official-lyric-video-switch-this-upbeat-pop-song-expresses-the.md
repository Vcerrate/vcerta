We are a collective of worship pastors who are passionate about creating songs that combine a modern sound with the truth of the Gospel.<br /><br />As pastors and songwriters, we really believe our purpose through Switch is to shine light on God’s truth in the middle of life’s difficulties. Anxiety and depression are real-life issues, and we shouldn’t downplay or cover it up. It’s exactly what Christ came to save us from. So, we’re not going to dance around the hard issues. We are committed to writing songs of prayer to cling to, especially when life gets tough.<br /><br />FOLLOW US:<br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://SWITCH.lnk.to/spotifyID">https://SWITCH.lnk.to/spotifyID</a><br />Apple: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://SWITCH.lnk.to/applemusicID">https://SWITCH.lnk.to/applemusicID</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://SWITCH.lnk.to/InstagramID">https://SWITCH.lnk.to/InstagramID</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://SWITCH.lnk.to/facebookID">https://SWITCH.lnk.to/facebookID</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://SWITCH.lnk.to/websiteID">https://SWITCH.lnk.to/websiteID</a><br /><br />ABOUT LIFE.CHURCH<br />Wherever you are in life, you have a purpose.
