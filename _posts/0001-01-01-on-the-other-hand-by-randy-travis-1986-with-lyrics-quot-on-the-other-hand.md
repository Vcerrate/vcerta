{% raw %}&quot;On the Other Hand&quot; is a country music song written by Paul Overstreet and Don Schlitz. It was first released as a single in July 1985, peaking at number 67 in the United States. It was Randyâ€™s first single with Warner Bros. Nashville and was only a minor hit. After the chart successes of Travis' next single, &quot;1982&quot;, the label reissued &quot;On the Other Hand&quot; in April 1986, and it became his first number one hit in both the United States and Canada.{% endraw %}
