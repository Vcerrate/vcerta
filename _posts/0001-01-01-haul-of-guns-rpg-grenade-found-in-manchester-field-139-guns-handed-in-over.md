{% raw %}Bomb squad carried out controlled explosions in Kersal moors last week after finding a haul of grenades and guns.<br />A stash of firearms and potentially deadly grenades were found in Kersal Moor last Friday after we acted on information that we had been provided by a member of the public.<br /><br />Specialist officers – including firearms cops and detectives from our Serious and Organised Crime Group – searched the area with support from the military.<br /><br />Five firearms were found during the operation as well as five hand grenades and a tank grenade.<br /><br />Enquiries are ongoing into who the weapons may have been associated with, and forensic experts are assessing whether the guns – made up of pistols, a sawn-off shotgun and a rifle – may have been used in any previous shootings.{% endraw %}
