{% raw %}Hey guys, today, I wanted to take a look at another Early Access game, Orion: Prelude Dino Horde. I wanted to make a quick review for some of you who may be on the edge about whether or not to buy a game from a not-so-well known developer. But is it worth it? In the end, you have to decide, but I can sure help you get there.{% endraw %}
