{% raw %}Asmongold reads a WoW blue post confirming the rumor that Blizzard is banning boosting communities in World of Warcraft! The leak turned out to be true and it turns out WoW devs are actually cracking down on real money traders (RMT) and as well as raid/dungeon boosters who take gold. Will this get rid of the constant Trade Chat spam? Will the boosting communities have to get around this new rule to continue providing player services in the game? Asmongold explains the new change that is already active in the game, and discusses the direction WoW is going in after two of today's changes: WoW Boosting Ban &amp; The Cross-Faction Raiding. Is the next expansion looking promising now? With everything we learned today... Let's hear Asmongold's insight and opinion on WoW 9.2.5 and 10.0.<br /><br />â–º Asmongold's Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/asmongold">https://www.twitch.tv/asmongold</a><br />â–º Asmongold's Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/asmongold">https://twitter.com/asmongold</a><br />â–º Asmongold's 2nd YT Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ZackRawrr">https://www.youtube.com/user/ZackRawrr</a><br />â–º Asmongold's Sub-Reddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/</a><br /><br />Thank you all for watching!
