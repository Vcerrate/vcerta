{% raw %}It's so ragey!😬 Please send HELP ASAP!<br /><br />When Little Mama woke up this morning she woke up thinking about the next full moon. She even made her own song about the full moon. She then proceeded to make watermelon juice in the kitchen. When approached it said &quot;when the full comes I am going to eat you.&quot; And that's when I knew I was in trouble. 😬 I ran and it hunted me down. I was able to distract it and it ate it's dad. Then it found a balloon. Apparently the balloon looked delicious.. 🤦‍♀️ First it attacked Jordan with the balloon then proceeded to devour the balloon as if it as candy. I know it was born this way so I let it be in its natural habitat. <br />Check out this link for more info on Memberships including Emojis, Badges, Live Events and More.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkLebsCaMfjDkWSKctBH0Hw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkLebsCaMfjDkWSKctBH0Hw/join</a><br />#teamlilmama #middlechild #siblings #animal{% endraw %}
