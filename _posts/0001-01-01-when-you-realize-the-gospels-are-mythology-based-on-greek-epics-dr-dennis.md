{% raw %}**Apologies for the video/audio being slightly out of sync in places.<br /><br />Today I spoke with Dr. Dennis MacDonald, who has done groundbreaking work demonstrating that the Gospels and Acts are imitating and rewriting Greek and Roman epics such as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Euripides' Bacchae, and Virgil's Aeneid, among others.<br /><br />We discussed many topics, including:<br />• How people in the ancient world would often write stories that compared their superheroes using extraordinary tales, like having supernatural births, walking on water, flying, turning water into wine, clearing bad men out of their house, keeping their identity secret at times, visiting the land of the dead, possessing incredible powers of healing, has feasts for thousands, dying because their god has abandoned them, rising from the dead, and living forever, etc.<br />• Acknowledging that Christianity is an elaborate and toxic &quot;con&quot;.<br />• How Christianity is psychologically abusive to children.<br />• Seeing Christianity is about separating the in-group versus the out-group, and then pushing the polarization and demonizing the outsider.<br />• How Christians refuse to admit many inconvenient truths that undermine the claims of their worldview.<br />• How to talk -- or not talk -- to Christians who refuse to acknowledge the origins of their religion.<br />• And many more topics.<br /><br /><br />Many thanks for Dr. MacDonald for sharing his story today.  I look forward to diving into more of his work and talking with him again.<br /><br />_________________________________________<br /><br /><br />Check out Dr. MacDonald's books<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=dennis+macdonald&amp;i=stripbooks">https://www.amazon.com/s?k=dennis+macdonald&amp;i=stripbooks</a><br /><br />Watch more of Dr. MacDonald's interviews:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MythVisionPodcast/search?query=dennis%20macdonald">https://www.youtube.com/c/MythVisionPodcast/search?query=dennis%20macdonald</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GnosticInformant/search?query=dennis%20macdonald">https://www.youtube.com/c/GnosticInformant/search?query=dennis%20macdonald</a><br /><br /><br />_________________________________________<br /><br /><br />Mentioned in this video:<br />Read Enoch: Parallel.thebookofenoch.info/<br /><br />_________________________________________<br /><br /><br /><br />Your support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.<br /><br />Monthly<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist">https://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist</a><br /><br />One time<br />PayPal:      <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/harmonicatheist">https://paypal.me/harmonicatheist</a><br />Venmo:      @harmonicatheist<br /><br />The more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!<br /><br />--Tim<br /><br />_________________________________________<br /><br />Ending music by Eyal Raz, &quot;Friends&quot;<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ</a><br /><br />_________________________________________{% endraw %}
