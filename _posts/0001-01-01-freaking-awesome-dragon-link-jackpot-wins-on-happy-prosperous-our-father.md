{% raw %}Our father in heaven and Jesus would not support any soul on earth developing an addiction to anything much less gambling. While we don't see the term specifically in the Bible it would surely cause many to become ensnared by one or more of the seven deadly sins. Remember to give 10 percent to the church from your winnings if you choose to gamble.<br /><br />We take very extremely serious because we're not trying to support anything or encourage anything that might cause any single viewer to become influenced by these videos to the degree it causes anyone harm of any kind. We can no more help ourselves than we could help others without Jesus or the father in heaven it is not possible for man.<br /><br />Therefore we suggest if any viewer has a gambling problem or addiction they pray to Jesus to remove that addiction who through the holy spirit will remove it and if anyone feels they can't stop on their own if they reject asking for help from Jesus they should not continue to watch these. <br /><br />There are many things some very small that Jesus and our father consider much bigger than we do that can lead many to hell after this life, the Bible encourages us to avoid addiction of any type or kind by doing all things in moderation and within ones means so as not to injure another by our actions that may influence another. <br /><br />Our videos are not gambling we play in a home not public casino and use free play credit not cash and share what many consider movies use these to shed addictions not acquire them.<br /><br />Watch only so long as the viewing of these videos are for non-sinful purposes. <br /><br />The Seven Deadly Sins <br /><br />1. Lust<br />Lust is a strong passion or longing, especially for sexual desires.<br /><br />The Bible speaks about lust in 2 Timothy 2:22, “Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love [and] peace...”<br /><br />The Bible also mentions lust in the following verses: Job 31:1, Matthew 5:28, Philippians 4:8, James 1:14-15, 1 Peter 2:11 and 1 John 2:16.<br /><br />Chastity or self-control cures lust by controlling passion and leveraging that energy for the good of others.{% endraw %}
