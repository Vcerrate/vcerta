{% raw %}Where does Rapunzel hang out when she's in the city? In an apartment fit for a modern day princess. And she can't chill in her ballgown, so she's got her casual clothes, ready for a quiet night in after a huge day of Disney Princess duties. I made her a custom loft apartment out of Lego and it's fitted out with anything a princess might need. The second level is coming soon, so keep an eye out for that, but for now she has the perfect hi-tech kitchen and living area.<br /><br />And don't forget that you can also get a cool ellieV toys t-shirt and other stuff from here! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/elliev-toys-merch">https://teespring.com/stores/elliev-toys-merch</a><br /><br />Don't forget to subscribe! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/mPFBb1">https://goo.gl/mPFBb1</a><br /><br />Lots more ellieV toys videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/CXhf59">https://goo.gl/CXhf59</a><br />Sylvanian Families / Calico Critters videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1LpJvDr">http://bit.ly/1LpJvDr</a><br />Lego Friends videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/xbV84E">https://goo.gl/xbV84E</a><br /><br />Please subscribe and like if you enjoy - I appreciate every single one of your views!<br /><br />Music - Looks Like Success (audioblocks){% endraw %}
