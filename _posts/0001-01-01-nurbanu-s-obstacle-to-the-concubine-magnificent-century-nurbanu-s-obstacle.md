{% raw %}Nurbanu's Obstacle to the Concubine! | Magnificent Century<br />&quot;I’M IN CHARGE HERE!&quot; Magnificent Century Episode 129: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/S81yw0jGcdc">https://youtu.be/S81yw0jGcdc</a><br /><br />Hürrem blames Suleiman embittering the fight between Selim and Bayezid. As Bayezid chases up the ones who has set a trap for him, Selim gets worried that he'll get disclosed. Suleiman confiscates Mahidevran's wealth because she has supported the revolt. Hürrem brings Selim to account after she learns that he has set the trap for Bayezid. Meanwhile, Fatma plays Nurbanu and Huricihan off against each other and turns the harem upside down. Suleiman orders that Kara Ahmed will be executed since he has taken up the revolt. Someone witnesses Gazanfer's love for Nurbanu that causes to be shed blood. Hürrem takes a vow to not to choose between his sons and chooses her nominee for throne. <br /><br />At the age of 26, when he ascended to the throne, Sultan Suleiman aimed to build an empire more powerful than Alexander the Great and to render the Ottomans invincible. Throughout his 46-year reign, he became the greatest warrior and ruler of both East and West.<br /><br />The young Suleiman received news of his succession to the throne during a hunting party in 1520. Unaware that he would be ruling a reign beyond his dreams, he left behind his wife son and took to the road with his close friend and companion Pargali Ibrahim to reach the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul. As they started their journey overland, an Ottoman ship set sail from Crimea in the Black Sea, bringing female slaves as gifts for the Ottoman palace… On this ship was Alexandra La Rossa, the daughter of a Ukrainian Orthodox minister, taken away from her family and sold to the Crimean palace. She had no idea that she would become Hurrem, wife of Sultan Suleiman and mother of princes, ruling the empire with him through bloodshed and intrigue. <br /><br />As Sultan Suleiman conquered the world, his great passion for Hurrem would clash with his love for and trust in his closest friend and advisor, Grand Vizier Pargali Ibrahim, all set against the backdrop of the tension between Christian Europe and the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century.<br /><br />Cast: Halit Ergenç, Nebahat Çehre, Meryem Uzerli, Okan Yalabık, Nur Aysan, Selma Ergeç, Sema Keçik, Filiz Ahmet, Selim Bayraktar, Selen Öztürk, Nihan Büyükağaç, Burcu Tuna, Merve Oflaz, Arif Erkin, Ali Uyandıran, Alp Öyken, Murat Tüzün, Doğan Turan, Gökhan Çelebi, Yüksel Ünal.<br /><br />Official Page of Magnificent Century: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eng.tims.tv/diziler/magnificent-century">http://eng.tims.tv/diziler/magnificent-century</a><br />Official Twitter Page of Magnificent Century: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MYAskiderun">https://twitter.com/MYAskiderun</a><br />Official Facebook Page of Tims: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/NXjRta">https://goo.gl/NXjRta</a><br />Official Twitter Page of Tims: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/yVvgH0">https://goo.gl/yVvgH0</a><br /><br />#tims #magnificentcentury #muhtesemyuzyil #suleiman #hurrem #sultan #ottoman{% endraw %}
