{% raw %}A solar cooker is a device which is used to cook food directly under sun light without using Gas, LPG or electricity. It's a clean process of outdoor cooking. There are two types of cooker, box type and parabolic type. The later one is more efficient.<br /><br />We make our own solar cooker out of a cardboard box of 235mm x 235mm x 140mm in size. We used five pieces of thermocol inside the box as insulator as show in the video. Sizes were, 230mm x230mm x30mm one pieces, 200x110x10mm two pieces and 225x110x10mm two pieces. For top we have used a 4mm thick glass of 230mm x 230mm.  The reflector on top of the box was 470mmx235mm big.<br /><br />Bainergizer, youtube channel is founded by Saurav Chakraborty. Its acts as brain energizer for students and kids by giving science and technology related ideas, tutorials. Inspire them to make those by yourself and get more hands on,  diy projects, Diy ideas, Diy craft, Diy home and many more ideas to improve their skills. <br />There are several technology related ideas, video tutorials, on designing a robot, building a robot, robot how to make, robot ideas, remote control, toy, motor boats, under water robot, climbing robot, walking robots. <br />The channel also provides knowledge on different kindâ€™s of electronic toy, science project, science experiments, art works, airplanes, birds, hovercrafts, robot kits, educational kit, kits for kids and many more. <br />This is a good source of school projects, kids project, kids tutorial, summer project, student projects, training, tutorials, engineering projects, mechanical projects, electro mechanical projects, online training, solar energy projects. <br />Please subscribe if you liked the videos:<br />Youtube Channel:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/sauravchakra">https://www.youtube.com/user/sauravchakra</a><br />Facebooks Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Brainergizer/1606702352879992">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Brainergizer/1606702352879992</a><br />Inscrutable: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instructables.com/member/Saurav+Chakraborty/">http://www.instructables.com/member/Saurav+Chakraborty/</a><br />Google Plus : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+sauravchakra">https://plus.google.com/+sauravchakra</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://like2make.blogspot.in/">http://like2make.blogspot.in/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brainergizer/">https://www.instagram.com/brainergizer/</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/saurav_chakra/robots/">https://www.pinterest.com/saurav_chakra/robots/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/brainersier">https://twitter.com/brainersier</a><br />Tag: #SolarCooker #DIYSolarCooker #DIYsolar #solaroven  #schoolproject #scienceproject  #Brainergiser{% endraw %}
