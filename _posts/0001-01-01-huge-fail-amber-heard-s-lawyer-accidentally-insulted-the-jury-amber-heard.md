{% raw %}Amber Heardâ€™s Lawyer Accidentally INSULTED The Jury!<br />In their bid to help Amber win by any means possible, it seems her team of lawyers might have made things worse for her.<br /><br />And by â€˜made things worse,â€™ I mean the members of the jury might have taken offense to some of the things that were said during the last days of court.<br /><br />So, exactly what did Amberâ€™s lawyer do to the members of jury that could affect her chances of winning?<br /><br />Shortly after Johnny Deppâ€™s legal team had made their case during the closing arguments last week, Amberâ€™s people took the spot and it's safe to say that maybe they should have practiced a little more before coming on stage.<br /><br />Here on Film Streak we are all about the latest spill in Hollywood!
