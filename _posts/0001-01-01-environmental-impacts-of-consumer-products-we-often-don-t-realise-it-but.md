{% raw %}We often don’t realise it, but the decisions we make as consumers – from what products we buy to how we end up disposing of them – often affect other people in other places. In this programme we investigate how the sourcing, manufacturing and disposal of everyday products impact the environment, and in turn people. It also profiles VISY, an international packaging and recycling company that uses sustainable production processes.<br /><br />About ClickView:<br />We cover every level of learning - primary, secondary and tertiary, and are ready to help you and your students achieve greater outcomes.
