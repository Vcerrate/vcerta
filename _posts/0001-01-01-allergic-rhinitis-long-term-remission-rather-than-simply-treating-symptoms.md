{% raw %}Stephen Durham, Head of Section for Allergy and Clinical Immunology at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, and Professor of Allergy and Respiratory Medicine at Royal Brompton Hospital, London, focussed on prevention and cure of allergic disease rather than simply relieving symptoms, when he presented at the Royal Brompton Hospital. He focussed particularly on hay fever and gave various case studies which demonstrated the variety of symptoms that could occur ranging from mild to severe. He highlighted preventative treatments including skin pricks and tablets and discussed the results of both approaches.{% endraw %}
