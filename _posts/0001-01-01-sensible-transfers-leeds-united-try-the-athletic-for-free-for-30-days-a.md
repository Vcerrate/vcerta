But with Marcelo Bielsa in charge, they need to bring in a very specific type of player. Bielsa is known for his high energy, at times manic, high press and man-marking style. Which can take a while for players to get used to. So who could Leeds sign that would take to Bielsa-ball seamlessly?<br /> <br />Alex Stewart suggests solutions for centre forward, defensive midfielder, and centre midfielder.
