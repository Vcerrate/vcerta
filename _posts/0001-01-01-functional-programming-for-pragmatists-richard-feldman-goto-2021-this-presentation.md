Are you more interested in how effectively you can build and maintain software than how buzzword-compliant it is? Then this is the talk for you!<br />People like functional programming for different reasons. Some like it for the conceptual elegance, or the mathematical properties. Richard? He likes to build things. He likes it when the software he builds works well and is easy to maintain. For the past decade he's been using functional programming both professionally and as a hobbyist, and has found it has helped him ship higher quality software in less time than in the decade he spent writing object-oriented code before.<br />In this talk, he'll share the practical benefits he's enjoyed in FP, and the benefits other pragmatists [...]<br /><br />TIMECODES<br />00:00 Intro<br />04:17 Outline<br />04:31 Scope: What is functional programming?<br />06:32 Performance<br />06:51 Scope: Pure functions<br />08:55 Performance: Caching<br />10:57 Performance: Precomputing<br />12:14 Performance: Parallelizing<br />15:00 Performance: Performance drawbacks<br />19:02 Development<br />19:32 Development: Testing<br />22:26 Development: Revising<br />25:49 Development: Debugging<br />31:18 Development: Development drawbacks<br />32:35 Ecosystem<br />38:09 Summary<br />40:15 Outro<br /><br />Download slides and read the full abstract here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gotocph.com/2021/sessions/1973/functional-programming-for-pragmatists">https://gotocph.com/2021/sessions/1973/functional-programming-for-pragmatists</a><br /><br />RECOMMENDED BOOKS<br />Richard Feldman • Elm in Action • <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/387kujI">https://amzn.to/387kujI</a><br />Jeremy Fairbank • Programming Elm • <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WhZCE8">https://amzn.to/2WhZCE8</a><br />Wolfgang Loder • Web Applications with Elm • <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jblQ3q">https://amzn.to/3jblQ3q</a><br />Cristian Salcescu • Functional Programming in JavaScript • <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3y75jBS">https://amzn.to/3y75jBS</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GOTOcon">https://twitter.com/GOTOcon</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-">https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences">https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences</a><br />#FunctionalProgramming #FP #Elm #ElmInAction #Elmlang #Testing #Programming #ProgrammingLanguage #Immutability #PureFunctions #FunctionalLanguages #Debugging #Precomputing #Parallelizing #npm #JavaScript<br /><br />Looking for a unique learning experience?<br />Attend the next GOTO conference near you!
