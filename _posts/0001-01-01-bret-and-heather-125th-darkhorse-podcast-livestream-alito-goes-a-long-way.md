The new current thing is not the Pfizer data release that happened this week, although perhaps it should be. The new current thing is the leaked draft majority opinion from Judge Alito, Supreme Court Justice of the United States, which reveals that Roe v. Wade is likely to be overturned. We discuss abortion, abortion policy, and what Americans say when they’re polled about these things. Is there a hard-and-fast line to draw? Does biology provide insights? We argue that abortion is not a women’s issue, per se, but an issue that pertains to all humanity, while also being a feminist issue.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />Support the sponsors of the show:<br /><br />Vivo Barefoot: Shoes for healthy feet—comfortable and regenerative, enhances stability and tactile feedback.
