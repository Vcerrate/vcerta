{% raw %}Today I am releasing a nation from Russia. You may be asking what this nation could be. Ukraine possibly? You'll have to watch the video to find out.<br /><br />Sorry if the audio sounds bad. I changed the distance of my microphone and didn't readjust the audio properties enough. It will be fixed next video along with some video bitrate changes. <br /><br />Here's the links to the mods I used (ccHFM &amp; belle-cartographie):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/moretrim/ccHFM">https://github.com/moretrim/ccHFM</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/belle-cartographie/downloads">https://www.moddb.com/mods/belle-cartographie/downloads</a><br /><br />If you have any questions you can join my discord server - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/WH8faDjkJV">https://discord.gg/WH8faDjkJV</a><br /><br />All Music from Paradox Interactive<br /><br />As always, thank you for watching<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />(This video was supposed to be posted on April 1st.
