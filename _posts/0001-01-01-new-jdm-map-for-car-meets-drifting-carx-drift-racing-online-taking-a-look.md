{% raw %}Taking a look at the new Sun City JDM map with my buddy @Wazzup who showed me the best placed on this huge open world map. We invited some viewers to join us too. On this map you can drift in the city, do car meets in parking lots and do off-roading as well. There's even a proper drift track built into this map. A lot of highways to do some chill cruising. We're both drifting with 900 degrees steering wheels. He's using G27 Logitech and I'm using T300RS GT steering wheel.<br /><br />Outro song: Gill Bates - _91nova<br /><br />--- Join our Discord here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/R6y34My">https://discord.gg/R6y34My</a><br /><br />--- My Twitch link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/goosiesttv">https://www.twitch.tv/goosiesttv</a><br /><br />--- My PC stats: <br />Graphics card: GeForce RTX 3070<br />Processor: Ryzen 9 (4,8GHz)<br />RAM: 16GB<br />Disc Space: 1K SSD{% endraw %}
