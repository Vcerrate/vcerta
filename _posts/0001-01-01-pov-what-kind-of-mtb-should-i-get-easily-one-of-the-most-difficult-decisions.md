{% raw %}Easily one of the most difficult decisions someone can make in their entire life: What kind of MTB should I get? The answer involves all sorts of factors. What kind of riding do you primarily do? What kind of bike suits the trails near where you live? How often are you REALLY going to ride the bike park so do you need that 170mm sled? For some people, they want a bike that is fast and nimble for miles of singletrack, while others prefer a big squishy mountain smashing enduro machine for full send mode. But what if you like all the riding and you have all the trails near you? In that case I’m sorry I can’t help you. You’ll need all the bikes, just like Jeff and Liam.{% endraw %}
