{% raw %}Absolutely huge community cast today that turned into a two hour discussion about the future plans for Escape from Tarkov. Almost everything that can be talked about was talked about. Huge thanks to the Emissaries and of course Nikita for doing this. <br />Full Chat: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1294593275">https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1294593275</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Become a FORNICATING Member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3eQQmMw">https://bit.ly/3eQQmMw</a><br />JOIN THE DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/noiceguys">https://discord.com/invite/noiceguys</a><br />Second Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3077dnz">https://bit.ly/3077dnz</a><br />StarCitizen Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3r9vq9N">https://bit.ly/3r9vq9N</a><br />LATEST Tarkov News: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/39XY1Yo">http://bit.ly/39XY1Yo</a><br />EFT Like a PRO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2YVPEGs">http://bit.ly/2YVPEGs</a><br />Support: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/noiceguy">https://ko-fi.com/noiceguy</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Although I do sometimes get a hand from BSG and occasionally get to talk to Nikita or other members of the team, I do not work for BSG. I also work entirely off public information and past experiences of working in game dev myself, as well as following this game closely for several years. Unless I state very clearly otherwise, the information you're about to hear should be taken as speculation. You can either get no information or speculation, that's all we have to go off of these days unfortunately which is why it's easier to just say Thursday whenever anyone asks for dates. If you want hard facts and dates you won't get them, period.{% endraw %}
