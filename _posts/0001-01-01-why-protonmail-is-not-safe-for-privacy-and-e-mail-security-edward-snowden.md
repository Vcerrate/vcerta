{% raw %}Edward Snowden talked a lot about encrypted and privacy email. Is Protonmail a privacy option? Depends on the level of privacy and encryption you need in your email.

Encryption is not always 100% secure like some people think and while Protonmail can be a huge step in the right direction, you need to be smart when using technology of any kind. Especially email.
