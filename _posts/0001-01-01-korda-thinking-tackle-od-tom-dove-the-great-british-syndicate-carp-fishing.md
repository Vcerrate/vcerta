{% raw %}Korda Carp Angler and Monster Carp host Tom Dove returns in a BRAND NEW Thinking Tackle OD. Get ready for some amazing English carp caught from The Great British Syndicate.<br /><br />We kick off Season 5 with the return of Tom Dove to your screens. It’s been a long time since Dovey last appeared on Thinking Tackle, and with a new Syndicate ticket on Carthagena Lake we thought it the perfect time to capture how he approaches a typical British Syndicate water from late Summer into Autumn!<br /><br />Carthagena is a quintessential English pit, one of the oldest lakes in the heart of the Lea Valley which contains a head of incredible carp; old as the hills and one Common in particular, weighs in excess of 50lbs!<br /><br />With three trips at his disposal, Tom shows you exactly how he goes about approaching a water like this, finding the carp and then catching them. Going into detail about his thought processes behind each decision. You’ll find out why he opts to change from using his go-to Spinner to a Chod Rig and understand the emphasis he puts on bait throughout his angling. <br /><br />An episode that proves, if you get your Location, Rigs and Baiting correct – you can achieve consistency (even on the toughest of waters)!<br /><br />#korda #carpfishing #tomdove #thinkingtackleod #thinkingtackle #newseries #dovey #ukcarpfishing #korda #teamkorda #carpangling #bigcarp #youtube #adventure #fishing #englishcarp #ukcarp #carp #carthagenalake #monstercarp<br /><br />For more information visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.korda.co.uk">http://www.korda.co.uk</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/kordaofficial">https://www.facebook.com/kordaofficial</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/kordaofficial">http://instagram.com/kordaofficial</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/kordaofficial">https://twitter.com/kordaofficial</a>{% endraw %}
