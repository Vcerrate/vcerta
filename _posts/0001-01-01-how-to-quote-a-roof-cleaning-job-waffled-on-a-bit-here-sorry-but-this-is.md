{% raw %}Waffled on a bit here sorry but this is a process that new people to the game can use to quote your roof cleaning work. I personally just go off time I know it will take me these days but m2 is always a nice guideline to use if you're unsure on that. Hope this helps some of you out.<br />Thanks again for watching and let me know if there's anything you want to see.<br />Sid Partridge.<br /><br />Social:<br />www.PartridgeExteriorCleaning.co.uk<br />www.facebook.com/PartridgeExteriorCleaning<br />Instagram@PartridgeExteriorCleaning<br />Sid@PartridgeExteriorCleaning.co.uk<br /><br />Timecodes<br />0:00 - Intro<br />0:11 -  Measuring up the roof and pricing.<br />2:30 - Measuring up from Google Maps.<br />5:40 - Waffling about the Quoting process{% endraw %}
