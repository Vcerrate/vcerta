{% raw %}​@Longines #Longines #LonginesSpirit #LonginesSpiritZuluTime #MonochromeWatches<br />---------------<br />Longines is a brand with a rich history, and in many fields. One that stands out above the others is, without doubt, the field of aviation watches… Longines has drawn inspiration from this heritage to create the vintage-inspired Spirit watches, celebrating pilots, military personnel and sportsman that relied on Longines throughout its history. Launched in 2020, the Spirit featured COSC automatic movements and a choice of time-and-date or chronograph models. Combining old-school design cues with a contemporary execution, it relies on classic codes of the genre. But the Spirit hasn’t been designed using an existing vintage watch. For 2022, the brand with the winged hourglass introduces a new model with a particularly relevant function for an aviation-themed watch, a second time zone or GMT indication.
