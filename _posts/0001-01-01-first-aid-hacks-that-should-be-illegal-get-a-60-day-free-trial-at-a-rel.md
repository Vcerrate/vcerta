Today we talk about sneezing, headaches, bruises, snake bites, cauterizing wounds, motion sickness, tampons, pads, hiccups, choking, smelly feet, water in your ears, heartburn, and a ton of other stuff. I never thought I’d see a channel with more weird claims than Five Minute Crafts or Bright Side, but here we are. Which hacks should I react to next?<br />I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously. If there’s a subject you want me to discuss or something you’d like for me to react to, leave a comment down below. Many of my videos have been born out of suggestions directly from you, so don’t hold back!<br />-Doctor Mike Varshavski<br /><br />Help us continue the fight against medical misinformation and change the world through charity by becoming a Doctor Mike Resident on Patreon where every month I donate 100% of the proceeds to the charity, organization, or cause of your choice!
