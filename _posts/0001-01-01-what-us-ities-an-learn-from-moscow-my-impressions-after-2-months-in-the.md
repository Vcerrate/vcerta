{% raw %}Let's enjoy a night in Moscow! <br />Downtowns in America are considered dangerous especially at night.  I've spent 2 months in America visiting over a dozen cities like New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Atlanta, Houston, Chicago etc<br />They are fantastic. But most of them are hindered by street crime, homelessness and garbage.<br />But it doesn't have to be that way. <br />Look at Moscow, Seoul, Tokyo etc<br /><br />Let's do some Walking on Streets Moscow. <br /><br />Support me on Patreon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/russianplus">https://www.patreon.com/russianplus</a>{% endraw %}
