{% raw %}-TIMESTAMPS-<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br /><br />00:05 - It's a special birthday. 40 is a big number, but I had time to spend with my family and people at the club!<br /><br />00:20 - We could get the exposure for some of the players who haven't been getting the minutes.<br /><br />00:55 - We had good periods in that game, but we have two goals away.<br /><br />01:20 - It’s a huge achievement, you have to be very special to be inducted into it and Patrick did a lot.<br /><br />01:45 - Emotionally, it was very draining, and we’ll look at the challenges ahead.<br /><br />02:20 - Bukayo is feeling good. Aaron is out.<br /><br />02:45 - Aaron wanted to play, but it’s a bad injury and we’ll see.<br /><br />03:15 - Our players have been away and won big games and scored big goals.<br /><br />03:50 - At the end we’ll have unification from every leagues. <br /><br />04:25 - Five substitutes will help us tactically.<br /><br />04:50 - Tomi will be back this week.<br /><br />05:05 - He’s been away with COVID and hopefully will not go through this situation again.<br /><br />05:40 - Every unit has a role and must have the level of understanding.<br /><br />06:25 - I don’t tell the players to celebrate, but it’s great that they are hugging and celebrating with the fans.<br /><br />06:45 - Winning is the best moments in football.<br /><br />07:00 - We are so happy with Bukayo, with his progression within the club.<br /><br />07:30 - It’s the only thing we can control.<br /><br />08:00 - I don’t think we have a choice, whenever the premier league tell us to.<br /><br />08:30 - I think Florian is doing what he’s doing well. You can see how he’s developing.<br /><br />09:15 - The step was big for him and wasn’t fair to assess him.<br /><br />10:05 - Fans have the freedom to express themselves.<br /><br />10:40 - Spain, but the English have been great to me!<br /><br />11:10 - I don’t know how much Bukayo would have played but it is what it is.<br /><br />11:40 - I think Bukayo said he won’t complain, he just wants consistency from the referees.<br /><br />12:20 - It’s crucial because it’s the platform you can build on.<br /><br />13:00 - We haven’t discussed anything like that with Santi. If you ask anyone at this club about Santi they will have a smile on their faces.<br /><br />13:25 - I spoke with Santi on my birthday!<br /><br />13:40 - I haven’t spoken to William since he made his France debut. We are aware of his development. We’re happy with the exposure.<br /><br />-END-<br /><br />HaytersTV – Football Up Close.
