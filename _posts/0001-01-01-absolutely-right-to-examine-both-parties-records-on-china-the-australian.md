{% raw %}The Australian Foreign Editor Greg Sheridan says it is &quot;absolutely right&quot; to &quot;examine the records of both parties&quot; when it comes to the matter of China. <br /><br />This comes after Prime Minister Scott Morrison called Deputy Labor Leader Richard Marles a 'Manchurian candidate' in Question Time on Wednesday.<br /><br />&quot;I think the government has a good record on China but this rhetoric has been overdone in the last week,&quot; Mr Sheridan told Sky News host Peta Credlin. <br /><br />&quot;Having said that, it's absolutely right to examine the record of both parties.<br /><br />&quot;Labor has a very bad record on national security from its last term in government, when it cut out defence spending to record lows, didn't commission an Australian naval boat and made a mess itself of the China relationship.&quot;{% endraw %}
