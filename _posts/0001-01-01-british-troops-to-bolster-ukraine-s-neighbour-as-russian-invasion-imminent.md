{% raw %}British troops to bolster Ukraine’s neighbour as Russian invasion ‘imminent’.<br />BRITAIN may send hundreds more troops to Ukraine's NATO neighbours to boost their security forces amid fears of Russian invasion, a news report has claimed.<br />At present, Britain has 830 troops, tanks, armoured fighting vehicles, self-propelled artillery, engineers and air-defence and intelligence assets in Estonia where it is leading a 1,200 strong battle group. According to the reports, around 300 French troops are also set to be a part of the battle group.<br />The NATO personnel presence could possibly be increased in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland after its member states held talks over expanding their presence in the region.<br />Citing a defence source, the Times reported that the UK is looking at bolstering the existing missions with 'hundreds' of combat-ready soldiers that would be able to deploy at short notice.<br />The source told the publication: “They have asked the question around boosting those [enhanced Forward Presence missions] and the NATO mission in the Baltics. Countries are thinking about what they could do.”<br />The source added: “If there was a NATO ally about to have Russian troops knocking on their doorstep then they [the force] would be there quickly.”<br />Currently, there are also 140 British troops in Poland as part of NATO’s enhanced Forward Presence mission.<br />The comments come as Tobias Ellwood, chair of the House of Commons Defence Select Committee, appeared on BBC Newsnight to discuss the threat of an “imminent” Russian invasion.<br /><br /><br />IMPORTANT! <br />-None of these images, music &amp; video clips were created/owned by us. -This video is purely fan-made, if you (owners) have seen your content and want to remove this video, please message us privately or mail us<br />JustFor12345xyz@gmail.com<br />before doing anything.
