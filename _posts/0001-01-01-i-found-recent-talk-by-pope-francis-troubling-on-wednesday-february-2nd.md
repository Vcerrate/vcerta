{% raw %}On Wednesday February 2nd Pope Francis said things which many found upsetting.  What I found even more troubling was his extremely selective use of both Sacred Scripture and the Catechism of the Catholic Church to uphold beliefs that are contradicted by the Catechism, by the Documents of Vatican II, and by Jesus himself.  This leaves me with very real fears for the process of decision making that will take place at the Synod of October 2023.  <br />Meanwhile for an insight into what happens when one dies, see my book, &quot;I want to go to Heaven the moment I die.&quot;  This book costs 5 euro plus postage,  while there is also a Polish translation of the book in Poland.{% endraw %}
