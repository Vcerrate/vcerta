{% raw %}I was shocked when I saw what tourists have to go through with the Test &amp; Go package! They just want to travel to be a tourist in Thailand -- but make them do this?<br /><br />A fan of my channel sent me this video. Upon arrival to Thailand, every tourist must take a PCR test and then quarantine for 1 night in a hotel room to wait for the results. Test negative and then you are free to leave. Sounds great right? Well... even if you test negative you must test again!<br /><br />5 to 7 days after the first test, everyone is required to show up at a testing site to have another PCR test for Covid19. This is the experience of doing this PCR test in Pattaya, Thailand. The main site to do the Test &amp; Go Thailand PCR test is at Banglamung Hospital -- a government hospital in Naklua. <br /><br />The testing site is in a building under construction. It is also a holding area to take foreigners and Thais who tested positive to be taken away to quarantine facilities. That means you take the test in the same zone as those who are positive! <br /><br />While waiting, you can see Thais and foreigners with suitcases and backpacks ready to be loaded into baht buses to be taken away to Cholchan Hotel or to some field hospital facilities somewhere. Test positive, there is no choice. You will be found -- and taken away to somewhere. Freedom is not more for you. <br /><br />That means foreigners are made to go and do the PCR test at the same building, ground floor, as those who are sick and heading to quarantine. The separation between us? A waist-high little mesh boundary. Bizarre.  <br /><br />Be aware -- this is what you will go through when you come here. When you travel to Thailand, you take a risk of getting a positive test. Then it is mandatory government quarantine in a room for you! <br /><br />Welcome to Thailand, tourist.{% endraw %}
