{% raw %}Wake up gently with this 10 minute motivational morning workout. This is the best get out of bed routine as it starts slowly and then gradually builds to more energetic movements, setting you up perfectly for the day. <br /><br />Ideal for those who are not typically morning people as it's quick and easy.<br /><br />It also works just as well as a stretch and train workout or warm up before another more intense workout. If you have more time then why not follow this with my low impact interval training workout which is just 7 minutes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ct1_rvIWvKo">https://youtu.be/ct1_rvIWvKo</a><br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Lily x<br /><br />My website: Lilydawber.com<br />Twitter: @LilyDawber<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/lily.dawber.754">https://www.facebook.com/lily.dawber.754</a>{% endraw %}
