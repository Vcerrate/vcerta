{% raw %}Desire Fresnel is a classic reimagined. ETC has taken the best features of classic incandescent Fresnels and added the technology of LEDs. With the Lustr X8 array you are guaranteed better colors from high-quality light with impressive brightness.<br /><br />Near Field Communication (NFC) configuration and set up is available through the ETC Set Light app. The built-in Multiverse Wireless protocol enables DMX systems to be scaled up without excessive levels of radio energy. The 13-55 degree zoom controlled from the front and rear of the fixture, and impressive brightness through the entire zoom range are just a few of the features that will make this your new favorite workhorse fixture. <br /><br />For more information visit us at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etcconnect.com">https://www.etcconnect.com</a> or...<br />join a conversation at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://community.etcconnect.com">https://community.etcconnect.com</a><br /><br />To contact us for sales or support visit: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etcconnect.com/contactetc/">https://www.etcconnect.com/contactetc/</a> <br /><br />Patents and Trademarks: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etcconnect.com/IP">https://www.etcconnect.com/IP</a>{% endraw %}
