Hold the fuck up.<br /><br />Don’t need anything but crazy ideas,<br />I know we’re getting lucky when I see you appear. Our secret’s safe and sound,<br />Cause I know what I’ve found.<br />Got 99 problems and I’m going down.<br /><br />Got 99 problems and I’m going down.<br /><br />You got me tongue tied,<br />Let’s get outta sight.<br />*GOT ME TONGUE TIED*<br />To the place where hearts transcend. *WHEN I SEE YOU LOOK AT ME*<br />Let our bodies talk, run before we walk, *GOT ME TONGUE TIED*<br /><br />And descend again and again. *WHEN I SEE YOU LOOK AT ME*<br /><br />And when the beat starts rolling, I’ll never stop, ‘Cause your love calls like a hymn.<br />And the words you gave to my heart,<br />Welcome me to pain.<br /><br />But when I see you lookin’ at me,<br />‘Hey, what’s up? Know I’m down’.<br />I need a pick me up.<br />You said ya got some things to relieve. Need an out, it’s too much,<br />Well that makes two of us.<br />I see you look at me,<br />And words just ain’t a thing. I know it’s too much,<br /><br />Well that makes two of us.<br />I see you look at me,<br />And words just ain’t a thing. All I need is your touch, Yeah, that makes two of us.<br /><br />You got my head light,<br />Feelings outta sight,<br />In a place where love won’t end. But girl this could die,<br />No more you and I.<br />What a shameful truth to bend.<br /><br />Let it go,<br />I’m waiting for rain to wash away all my sins. Let it go!<br /><br />But when I see you lookin’ at me,<br />‘Hey, what’s up? Know I’m down’.<br />I need a pick me up.<br />You said ya got some things to relieve. Need an out, it’s too much,<br /><br />Well that makes two of us.<br />I see you look at me,<br />And words just ain’t a thing. I know it’s too much,<br /><br />Well that makes two of us. I see you look at me,<br /><br />And words just ain’t a thing. All I need is your touch, Yeah, that makes two of us.<br /><br />When I see you look at me.<br />I’ve been stuck in my own ways.<br /><br />I’ve been stuck in my own ways,<br />I feel lost, but I’m in my place.<br />Girl, I’m your drug and you’re my game. Wait on you, but it’s always the same. Don’t say that you didn’t want it,<br />We know that’d be dishonest.<br />What ya say? We’re okay?<br />I’m waitin’ on you.<br /><br />Don’t fuck up the pace.  <br /><br />But when I see you lookin’ at me,<br />‘Hey, what’s up? Know I’m down’.<br />I need a pick me up.<br />You said ya got some things to relieve. Need an out, it’s too much,<br /><br />Well that makes two of us.<br /><br />I see you look at me,<br />And words just ain’t a thing. I know it’s too much,<br />Well that makes two of us.<br />I see you look at me,<br />And words just ain’t a thing.<br /><br />All I need is your touch, Yeah, that makes two of us.<br /><br />#Windwaker  #Me+YouButMostlyMe  #LoveLanguage{% endraw %}
