{% raw %}Dedicated to all of our friends and family. <br /><br />Lyrics: <br />I think back, think back<br />To a day long gone<br />I think back and it bends my mind<br />I remember my friends <br />I remember the faces<br />I remember the shows in that basement <br /><br />Old friends, past lives<br />Late nights, long drives for nothing<br />Never said our goodbyes<br />We fell behind, but now we're catching up <br /><br />18, six strings <br />Sleeping in a van<br />We had no money, fuck a 9 to 5<br />We felt the whole world right in the palm of our hands<br />I hope you understand, I'd do it over again <br /><br />We never wanted it to end<br />All we had was time to spend <br /><br />Old friend, past life <br />Late nights dreaming of something <br />Never said a goodbye<br />We feel behind, but now we're catching up.{% endraw %}
