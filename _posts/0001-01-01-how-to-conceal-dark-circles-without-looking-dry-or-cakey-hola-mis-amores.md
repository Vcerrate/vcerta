{% raw %}Hola mis amores! <br />Today I thought that I would bring you my most up to date concealer routine! This is exactly what I have been doing to not only make my concealer last, but it also provides me with full coverage that lasts all day! I really like to film these to only share what I’m doing, but to also provide more ideas that you all can try yourselves. I find that the more and more I play around with products and techniques, the better my makeup looks :) <br /><br />Here’s where you can find Jamie Greenberg <br />Instagram- @jamiemakeup <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jamiemakeup/">https://www.instagram.com/jamiemakeup/</a><br />TikTok- @jamiemakeup <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jamiemakeup?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@jamiemakeup?lang=en</a><br /><br />I really hope that you all enjoy this video! <br /><br />As always, feel free to reach out with any questions, comments, concerns etc. <br /><br />And don't forget that you can also reach me through:<br />Instagram @allbeautybysarah<br /><br />Makeup worn and mentioned in this video:<br />*Patrick Ta Major Brow Lamination Gel- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3C8KlGj">https://bit.ly/3C8KlGj</a><br />*Sigma Beauty Color + Shape Brow Powder Duo in Medium- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3JbB56W">https://bit.ly/3JbB56W</a><br />*NYX Lift &amp; Snatch Brow Tint Pen in Black- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3haPmV4">https://bit.ly/3haPmV4</a><br />*Natasha Deanna Glam Face Palette in Light- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3vJbCxt">https://bit.ly/3vJbCxt</a><br />*Bareminerals Maximist Mascara- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3MggVdj">https://bit.ly/3MggVdj</a><br />*Milani Eyeshadow Primer- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3kEVKph">https://bit.ly/3kEVKph</a><br />*Hourglass Vanish Airbrush Primer- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3uO4qzM">https://bit.ly/3uO4qzM</a><br />*Sigma Beauty Spectrum Cool-Correcting Duo in Medium to Dark- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3vLTIu9">https://bit.ly/3vLTIu9</a><br />*Beauty Pie Superluminous Under Eye Genius in Medium/Deep- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3yaOr0J">https://bit.ly/3yaOr0J</a><br />*Smashbox X Becca Under Eye Brightening Corrector in Medium- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/37qJTIC">https://bit.ly/37qJTIC</a><br />*Charlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin Foundation in 6 Neutral- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3MtGzLR">https://bit.ly/3MtGzLR</a><br />*Tarte Shape Tape in Light Medium Honey and Medium Honey- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ttcp4B">https://bit.ly/3ttcp4B</a><br />*OneSize Ultimate Blurring Setting Powder- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3kEDrkj">https://bit.ly/3kEDrkj</a><br />*Hourglass Veil Soft Focus Setting Spray- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3EmEQ7X">https://bit.ly/3EmEQ7X</a><br />*Bareminerals Well Rested Eye Brightener- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3tt16t5">https://bit.ly/3tt16t5</a><br />*Huda Beauty Glowish Soft Radiance Bronzing Powder in Medium- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3KElw7S">https://bit.ly/3KElw7S</a><br />*Huda Beauty Glowish Cheeky Vegan Blush Powder in Caring Coral- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3scpZZc">https://bit.ly/3scpZZc</a><br />*Mario Ultra Suede Cozy Lip Creme in Pinky Brown- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3pYB3YM">https://bit.ly/3pYB3YM</a><br /><br />*Here's where you can purchase my Sigma Favorites Set and where you can find all of the Sigma brushes that I mention: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2LSUE6e">https://bit.ly/2LSUE6e</a><br />You can also use the discount code ALLBEAUTYBYSARAH for 10% off of your purchase at sigmabeauty.com  :) <br /><br />*Disclaimer, some of the links within this list are indeed affiliate links.
