{% raw %}In &quot;Receiving The Loving Heart,&quot; G. Steven Simons reveals that the motive for obedience in the New Covenant is not fear of the death penalties associated with the commands of Elohim, but LOVE for the One who paid our death penalty. This is a powerful teaching that brings to light a love revolution that Elohim brought to pass through Yeshua's redemptive sacrifice and the outpouring of YAH's spirit that shows the believer to love YAH and keep His commandments. #ReceivingTheLoving Heart<br /><br />Message notes: www.triumphintruth.global/messagenotes<br /><br />Thank you for watching Triumph In Truth.
