Thank you again!)<br /><br />As an ongoing cancer survivor, Warcraft’s stories continue to be a source of comfort &amp; relief. This is the best way I've found to introduce the wonderful World of Warcraft to old and new players alike, with its rich lore, characters and extreme potential. You can expect a retelling of in-game questlines, dialogue, adventures, cinematics &amp; cutscenes to help players keep up with the ever evolving lore of the game.<br /><br />It's an incredible experience from start to finish! If that sounds like you, then you're in the right place!<br /><br />World of Warcraft belongs to the mighty Blizzard Entertainment.<br /><br />Soundtracks/Images Used: (Note- All Credit for music and/or images used belongs and goes to the artists/creators of this amazing music/art.
