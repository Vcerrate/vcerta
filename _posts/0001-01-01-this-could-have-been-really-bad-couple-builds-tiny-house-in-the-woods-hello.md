{% raw %}Hello everyone, The weather here has been on the fritz lately lol. Roxane and myself are not used to this kind of weather like some of you guys probably are. Sometimes it just seems like its working against us. We had a surprise in the side yard that could have caused A LOT of problems for us. Thank you all for being here, we appreciate you.
