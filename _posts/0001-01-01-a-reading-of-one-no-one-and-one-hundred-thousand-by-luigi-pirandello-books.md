{% raw %}This is a video of me narrating Books 1 &amp; 2 of Luigi Pirandello's Novel. <br />Please read along if you can, with the translators note being specifically interesting as it mentions the long journey Pirandello had in his writing career (as well as in finishing this particular work).<br />It is an unconventional story, but one I found extremely helpful in making light of such a philosophical conversation. I find that 2021 is the perfect time in which we can understand and appreciate Pirandello's satire, as well as the quest in which his narrator takes in attempting to truly discover his own true personality. I find this book reminds me of one of my first ever lessons in my own studies in Psychology during my undergraduate degree. The lecturer asks you a simple question; What is personality? And you begin to fall into a rabbit hole of trying to identify your own personality whilst attempting to distinguish it from others', as well as trying to understand your identity and what makes you, you. And thus, begins the journey of the protagonist in this novel wherein he attempts to discover who he truly is. Stay tuned to for the outcome. <br /><br /><br />#Note- forgive me if I make any mistakes in any name pronunciations or any impediments I may have; as this is the first time I have ever read a book aloud before. <br /><br /><br />I hope you enjoy!{% endraw %}
