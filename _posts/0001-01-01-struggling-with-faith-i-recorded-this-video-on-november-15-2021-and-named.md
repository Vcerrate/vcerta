{% raw %}I recorded this video on November 15, 2021 and named it “Struggling with Faith” on my laptop when it felt like my entire life was falling apart and there were no signs of it getting better. I was unhappy, struggling with my faith and what I was supposed to be doing more than I ever had, that I ended up not wanting to share this video. I came across it last night and so happy and blessed to be able to share that I got my faith back…. and everything I was going through at this time was worth it ALL - But… I’m going to be honest. It took 2.5 months from recording this video to reach that place and it was not a fun or easy process. It was a lot of tears. It was a lot of anger. It was a lot of reflecting. It was a lot of having to be honest with myself and others. It was a lot of risks. It was a lot of fighting to hold on to the little faith I still had. If you are struggling with faith right now, I promise you whatever it is you’re going through is a test of your faith and you just have to wholeheartedly believe that it’s all going to work out eventually and it will. Not believe it for a second. Not just believe it when things are good. Believe it no matter what is or isn’t going on, no matter how it feels and no matter what anyone says to you. I will never, ever question God or lose faith like that again and I am so grateful for being able to reach that place and share this with you. <br /><br />Subscribers: 21,026<br />SUBSCRIBE &amp; TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS! <br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/jen_deleon">http://instagram.com/jen_deleon</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/jen_deleon">http://twitter.com/jen_deleon</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://jendeleon.com">http://jendeleon.com</a><br />Email: info@jendeleon.com{% endraw %}
