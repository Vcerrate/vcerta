The campaign began as a one-off game organized for Liam's birthday. The campaign itself started on December 8, 2012.[1] The very first session was played by Liam O'Brien, Sam Riegel, Laura Bailey, Travis Willingham, Taliesin Jaffe, and Orion Acaba, with Matthew Mercer as the Dungeon Master.<br /><br />In 2015, they were approached by Felicia Day to stream their campaign live on the Geek &amp; Sundry twitch channel. When Matt told the other cast members about her offer, the group's reactions were recorded for posterity. <br /><br />Do you love DICE as much as Laura Bailey, then take a look at the AWESOME dice by Easy Roller Dice and get 15% off with code MINI15 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://easyrollerdice.com/">https://easyrollerdice.com/</a><br /><br />Full Critical Role episodes can be seen here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/criticalrole">https://www.youtube.com/c/criticalrole</a><br /><br />Is It Thursday yet?<br /><br />#CriticalRole #Shorts<br /><br />Cast: Matthew Mercer, Marisha Ray, Laura Bailey, Liam O'Brien, Taliesin Jaffe, Ashley Johnson, Travis Willingham,  Sam Riegel.{% endraw %}
