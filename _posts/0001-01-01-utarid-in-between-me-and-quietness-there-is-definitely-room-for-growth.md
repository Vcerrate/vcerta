{% raw %}Tribute to the kings of real screamo from Malaysia. Utarid was an amazing Screamo/Hardcore Band from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and one of the best bands in this region.<br /><br />Sadly the band broke up, shortly after they toured in europe in summer 2005, but played a last show in malaysia in march 2006. The members can be found in new, amazing bands like i/am/rain, kias fansuri, elisabelle tears, killeur calculateur and orbit cinta benjamin. Utarid should be seen as the root of a bunch of amazing bands from south-east influencing our scene with their very own style of hard- and heartcore music. All that's left are memories of weeks full of friendship and passion, playing along various european bands. One of the most influencial bands on me.<br /><br /><br /><br />In Between Me And Quietness lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;Wait up for me!This grass has got me slowed down.<br /><br />This wind blew a partition running in circles.<br /><br />Do you want to start over now?<br /><br />You seem a little tired, steps start sinking.<br /><br />No more words on my grey tongue.<br /><br />I'll catch up with you later...<br /><br />At once a voice arose I called up your name.<br /><br />And the standstorm starts to ruin,<br /><br />And destroyed everything else.<br /><br />My joy dissapeared and my laughter ceased and<br /><br />It's nothing but anger I unleash.<br /><br />The sound of my heartaches,<br /><br />I sort of nothing to say, and if I did I say,<br /><br />Nothing at all, now I'm too scared to touch a friend like you.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />There Is Definitely Room For Growth lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;Crust heart turned cold, damage done and nothing left. <br /><br />Bruises torn and now she's gone, why our respect run so dry? <br /><br />Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives. <br /><br /><br /><br />Cadence! Erase the pain! <br /><br />Blood spilled over the dancefloor. <br /><br />It not supposed what it meant. <br /><br />Be careful what you wish for. <br /><br />For I'm not intended. <br /><br />Do we arise to fall? We're not here to fall. <br /><br />Those plastic friends often break your heart.&quot;{% endraw %}
