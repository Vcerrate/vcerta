{% raw %}Following the Strade Bianche, I visited Adam Isherwood at Oxford University, in order to undertake another lab test and learn more about the physiology of riding at my best endurance pace.  As a result Adam ran a new test to calculate as accurately as possible where my aerobic threshold aka lactate threshold lies.  Through cycling at or below this threshold we spare muscle glycogen and improve our endurance.  If we stray above this threshold, then we start utilising more carbohydrates for fuel and need to eat more to compensate.  Adam also demonstrates the amount of carbohydrate being used to fuel the effort including a little bolt on test riding at my anaerobic threshold / FTP.  You will be surprised at the level of carbohydrate required to fuel the effort!  <br /><br />There are a number of takeaways as to what the science tells us about optimising our endurance pace, but the 2 key standouts require us to have a better understanding as to where our physiological aerobic threshold lies and the carbohydrates we need to ingest in order to avoid the dreaded bonk! <br /><br />To translate the subtitles to your preferred language, please go to the settings cog on the video, and make sure subtitles are turned on.  Then select auto-translate, and then select the language you prefer.<br /><br />Please leave those comments and hit that subscribe <br /><br />Thanks ever so much for all of your support!
