Because to be socially assertive, it means you're putting your needs forward, but you're being polite about it.” [16:05]<br /><br />“I would rather you be aware of the cues that are being sent to you to know, ‘I want this or I don't’ because they are that powerful, that if someone has bad intentions, they can still produce trust.” [41:01]<br /><br />“I think that's something that is an underestimated cue that we don't talk about enough, but our voice gives away a lot of our personality and our mental state.” [43:10]<br /><br />“I think that people who doubt their ideas, and they doubt themselves, that leaks in their cues.” [47:35]<br /><br />“Our subconscious is this amazing cue reading machine. And so it is constantly trying to tell your gut, ‘Listen, that wasn't good. We should be nervous,’ or, ‘This person is great.’ It's constantly trying to speak to us, we just have to listen to it.” [51:37]<br /><br /><br />Follow Vanessa Van Edwards:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/">https://www.scienceofpeople.com/</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3v2mvKR">https://bit.ly/3v2mvKR</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3oXUYX6">https://bit.ly/3oXUYX6</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3BzmgrX">https://bit.ly/3BzmgrX</a> <br />Order Cues: Master the Secret Language of Charismatic Communication: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3h2Eg4p">https://amzn.to/3h2Eg4p</a>{% endraw %}
