In studying their actions and behaviours, we can see clearly how the highest ideals of spirituality are embodied and expressed in everyday encounters with life. In this lecture, we recount some of the struggles of young Rakhal (later Swami Brahmananda), a direct disciple of the modern day avatar, Paramahansa Ramakrishna in his formative years under the assumption that many of these struggles will have meaning for householders since Rakhal himself was married and had to deal with a father who disapproved of his spirituality. Also, these formative years demonstrate what an authentic spiritual life looks like and highlights the unique relationship between a student (shishya) and a Guru. <br />May these words serve you!<br />May this be an offering to Sri Ramakrishna and his disciples!<br /> <br />00:00:00 What Is This Lecture Going To Be About?<br />00:01:08 The Ideals of Indian Spirituality<br />00:06:41 Can These Ideals Even Be Achieved By Mere Mortals?<br />00:10:00 Why Is Swami Brahmananda's story important to householders?<br />00:12:12 Swami Vivekananda vs Swami Brahmananda<br />00:17:52 Can You Be Born Into Spirituality?<br />00:21:00 Keshab Chandra Sen and the Brahmo Samaj<br />00:24:38 Who is Paramahansa Ramakrishna?
