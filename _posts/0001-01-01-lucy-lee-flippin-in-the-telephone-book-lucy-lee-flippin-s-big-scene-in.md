{% raw %}Lucy Lee Flippin's big scene in The Telephone Book, one of my all-time favorite movies! I also included part of the previous scene so you can get a taste of the rest of the film. The movie is legitimately available for the first time ever from Vinegar Syndrome, and it's really one of the greatest unseen cult films ever made. I can't believe that I never put the connection together between Lucy Lee Flippin and the family that owned the newspaper I used to work for. I wish I had figured it out earlier, because I totally would have tried to get an autograph!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vinegarsyndrome.com">http://vinegarsyndrome.com</a>{% endraw %}
