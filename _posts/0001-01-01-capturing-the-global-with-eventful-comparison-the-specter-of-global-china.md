How do we leverage ethnography to address theoretically meaningful sociological questions? How can a method that is conventionally seen as inherently microscopic and place-based become the paradigmatic method for studying multi-sited, macroscopic and footloose processes? We explore these questions by discussing different logics of comparison, ethnography’s humanistic and scientific moments, and the intellectual challenges of global sociology. Through critical reflections on my own practice of comparative and global ethnographies, this mini-course introduces students to the process and building blocks of ethnographic research: formulation of research puzzles, “casing,” theoretical sampling, varieties of comparison, concept formation, theory (re)construction, issues of power and ethics. To enhance pedagogical effectiveness, students should bring with them research ideas which will be used as examples and exercises for discussions. <br /><br />►►臺大演講網<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://speech.ntu.edu.tw">http://speech.ntu.edu.tw</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/ntuspeech">http://www.facebook.com/ntuspeech</a>{% endraw %}
