He knew that he wanted to live off the grid and when the county he lived in wouldn't let him build a Yurt on his land, he decided a skoolie was the next best option. A school bus checked all the boxes for Thomas; a lift for getting his wheelchair in and out of his home, wide enough to have room for 360* turns, and plenty of space for storage! The wood design aesthetic used throughout his skoolie is beautiful, and the shower with slate tiles is huge! Not to be outdone by the wood design, the electronics and solar on this bus are amazing. Such an great tour and an even better dude. Thanks for sharing your home and story with us Thomas! <br />Thomas - IG -<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thefartherbus/">https://www.instagram.com/thefartherbus/</a><br /><br />______________________________BONUS CONTENT_____________________________________<br />Nature's Head Toilet With Bonuses - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/NaturesHeadTHT">http://bit.ly/NaturesHeadTHT</a><br />Tiny House &amp; Skoolie Build Gear - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://skooliecentral.com/gear/">https://skooliecentral.com/gear/</a><br />Tiny Home Tours Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Tinyhome.tours/">https://www.facebook.com/Tinyhome.tours/</a><br />Tiny Home Tours Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tinyhometours/">https://www.instagram.com/tinyhometours/</a><br />Life On The Road Newsletter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eepurl.com/gAyDP5">http://eepurl.com/gAyDP5</a><br />Want To See More Skoolie Videos? - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://skooliecentral.com/">https://skooliecentral.com/</a><br />Need Something On Amazon?
