{% raw %}(TW: Miscarriage) This is the hardest video I have ever uploaded. Took me a month to film it after the incident and more than a month to actually bring myself to edit it. I teared so many times while editing and reliving the experience, but I told myself that the ultimate end goal for sharing this is to create awareness about miscarriages and to help those who are experiencing this heartbreaking event like I did. If you're here because you can relate to this, I am here for you. I know how it feels. I'm praying for you. Please know that you are not alone. I hope you can stay strong, overcome it and not lose hope for your future. <br /><br />❀ ON ME ❀ <br />Kyra Summer Set from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nikoandclare.com/">https://www.nikoandclare.com/</a><br /><br />—————————————————————<br />► LET'S KEEP IN TOUCH<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/charisow​​">http://instagram.com/charisow​​</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/charisow​​">http://www.twitter.com/charisow​​</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/charisowTV​​">http://www.facebook.com/charisowTV​​</a><br />TikTok: @charisow<br />Email: hello@charisow.com<br />—————————————————————<br />Join the #CHAYANGS​ family and subscribe now:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/user/charisowTV?sub_confirmation=1">http://youtube.com/user/charisowTV?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />It will mean the world to me!
