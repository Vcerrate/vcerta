{% raw %}A conscript of the National Guard destroyed an enemy drone in the Luhansk region.<br /><br />Militarnyi informs about it.<br /><br />The burned wreckage and ash are what remained from the drone.The fighter with the call sign “Klapan” (valve – ed.) used a regular АК-74 to “land” the drone.“I received information from the commander that an enemy drone had entered our area. Later, I heard the sound, and then the target itself. At an altitude of 200-300 meters it was quite visible. Then, everything went fast: I attached the horn and opened fire. I shot one store, and when I moved onto the other – it has already started to turn around and fly towards me. I had a few more rounds left. I fired – and this drone was already going down in circles, after which I heard an explosion!” said “Klapan.”<br /><br />Judging by the published photos, it is a KUB-UAV kamikaze drone.<br /><br />This is a strike system designed to hit distant ground targets.The drone was designed by Zala Aero.It is made according to the “flying wing” scheme with a pushing air propeller in the tail part, and is launched from a catapult.<br /><br />The length of the drone is 95 centimeters and the wingspan is 1.2 meters.It can stay in the air for up to 30 minutes, reaching the speed of up to 130 kilometers per hour.<br /><br />The maximum payload of the KUB-UAV is three kilograms.Back in early March, such a drone attacked border guards in the Luhansk region. The UAV was also shot down.{% endraw %}
