{% raw %}The AK-12 is a new Russian military assault rifle chambered in 5.45×39mm, designed and manufactured by the Kalashnikov Concern. We take a closer look at the TR3, a civilian semi automatic version of the rifle and discover that under the cool looks there isn't much to show...<br /><br />Big thanks to @Austria Arms for lending the rifle and shout out to &quot;Uncle Harry&quot; from @9-Hole Reviews :)<br /><br />You can support us at:<br />¤ Polenar Tactical Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://polenartactical.com/shop/">https://polenartactical.com/shop/</a><br />¤ Join our community at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/polenartactical">http://www.patreon.com/polenartactical</a><br />¤ or slide in our DMs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/PolenarTactical">http://instagram.com/PolenarTactical</a><br /><br />Ammo provided by Sellier &amp; Bellot  <br />FB: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SellierBellotAmmunition">https://www.facebook.com/SellierBellotAmmunition</a><br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sellier_bellot_official/">https://www.instagram.com/sellier_bellot_official/</a>{% endraw %}
