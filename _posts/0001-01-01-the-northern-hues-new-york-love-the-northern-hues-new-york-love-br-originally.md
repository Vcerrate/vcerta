{% raw %}The Northern Hues - New York Love <br />Originally released January 01, 2003 <br /><br />I do not own the rights to this song.<br /><br />The Northern Hues, a Philadelphia-based sextet, was created in early 2002 by guitarists Aron Brand and Jeff Rains. Vocalist Dan Avidan joined the two shortly thereafter, writing songs for many months in North New Jersey. In the Spring of 2003 the band broadened to include multitalented Alex Yaker and drummer Ian Creech. <br /><br />Incorporating an experimental melodic sound faithful to the British Pop/Rock and New wave, as well as the American indie-rock scene, Northern Hues will appeal to fans of the Verve, New Order, and R.E.M. They have also been compared to the Samples, Traffic, and even early Genesis. They are currently playing in the Philadelphia and NYC metro areas, as well as working on their first EP to be released at the end of the Fall of 2004. <br /><br />Past shows include appearances at Pianos (NYC), Sine` (NYC), Luna Lounge (NYC), Don Hill's (NYC), the Pontiac Grille, Northstar Bar, the Khyber, Grape Street Pub, Doc Watson's, the Fire, Mill Creek Tavern, the 5 Spot, and other venues. The Northern Hues have shared the stage with Los Halos, the Cosmic Rough Riders (UK), Y.O.U., Elefant (NY), The Primms (UK), White Hassle, comedian Todd Barry and many more.{% endraw %}
