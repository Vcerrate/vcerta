Obviously, this isn't a thing that's happening, and the rate of fires at these facilities isn't increasing, but Greene is not a serious person and she'll do whatever it takes to please an audience. Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins discusses this. <br /><br />Link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.alternet.org/2022/05/majorie-taylor-greene/">https://www.alternet.org/2022/05/majorie-taylor-greene/</a><br /><br />Become a member today!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join</a><br /><br />Support us by becoming a monthly patron on Patreon, and help keep progressive media alive!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire">https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire</a><br /><br />Find our merchandise at Teespring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store">https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store</a><br /><br />Spread the word!

Democrats are starting the fires on purpose in order to deprive the nation of food, which would be advantageous for them because they're playing some sort of globalist long game and don't want anything to be manufactured in America or something like that. It's not totally clear. I, I love how she at the end is like, maybe I don't even know. I'm just saying weird crap to Alex Jones, cuz he likes it. And of course Alex Jones did appear to kind of go along with it and you know, he was talking, he said, you know, it seems mathematically impossible for processing plants to be catching fire. <br /><br />Like they have been so far this year and sure there's been some fires, uh, because there's fires every year. There's actually literally thousands of fires every year at manufacturing facilities across the United States, there is not an increase in the number of fires this year. It is on par. But if we wanna talk about fires at manufacturing facilities that happen in the thousands per year, maybe we ought to be talking about safety and regulation instead of immediately going to conspiracy theories that Democrats are burning down our food supply for a reason, Marjorie Taylor green, isn't even sure of like, she doesn't know why Democrats would benefit from destroying all the food in the country, but she just knows deep down they're doing it, but she hasn't figured out the why yet she'll get around to that eventually. Maybe possibly, you know, the, why's not always important. <br /><br />What is important for them though is spreading the conspiracy theory and distracting people from the real issue, which is of course that we have very serious safety problems here in the United States of food processing facilities. I mean manufacturing facilities in general, if we're seeing thousands of fires a year, don't you think maybe we ought to be investigating that don't you think maybe we ought to be acting stricter safety regulations saying, Hey Mr corporation here, running this facility, uh, you got some real fire hazards on your hand here. People could die. May maybe you should do something about that before we throw you in jail. But of course we can't do that because these same factories that are catching on fire every couple of days are also the ones that fund campaigns. They fund Democrats, they fund Republicans. They're buddy, buddy, with those folks up on, uh, you know, up in the regulatory agencies. They've got that revolving door. Hey, don't come down too hard on us. Cuz when we leave, maybe we got a position for you. Or maybe when you leave, you come here, we send one of our guys <br /><br />Up there. That's the revolving door folks. That's why we're seeing these fires. It's not because Democrats are setting fire to these facilities because there's no way to slice that. That makes any sense whatsoever. Oh, people starving to death. Dang it. This is gonna benefit the Democrats like killing people across the country because they can't eat again.{% endraw %}
