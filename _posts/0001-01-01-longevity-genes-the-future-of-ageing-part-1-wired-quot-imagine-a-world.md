{% raw %}&quot;Imagine a world, where you live to an old age, over 100 years old, but you are healthy all the time, you are doing fun things, and you are spending time with your family, and one day you don't wake up. Wouldn't it be wonderful for the individual, for the families, for the economy, for everyone?&quot;.<br /><br />In episode one of Wired UK's four-part documentary series, we delve into the future of ageing; why are certain people able to live longer than others? What makes centenarians unique? How are they able to reach the age that they have? Taking in expert analysis and insights from Dr. Nir Barzilai, Director of the Institute for Ageing Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, this series aims to explore the science behind longevity genes and what this research could mean for the future of humankind. <br /><br /><br /><br />Subscribe to WIRED UK ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/wireduk?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/wireduk?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Visit the WIRED website ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wired.co.uk">https://www.wired.co.uk</a><br /><br />Subscribe to WIRED Magazine ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wired.co.uk/subscribe">https://www.wired.co.uk/subscribe</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Sign up for one or more of our WIRED newsletters: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wired.co.uk/newsletters">https://www.wired.co.uk/newsletters</a><br /><br /><br /><br />CONNECT WITH WIRED<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/wireduk">https://www.facebook.com/wireduk</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/wireduk">https://www.instagram.com/wireduk</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/wireduk">https://twitter.com/wireduk</a><br /><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/wired-uk">https://www.linkedin.com/company/wired-uk</a><br /><br /><br /><br />ABOUT WIRED<br /><br />WIRED brings you the future as it happens - the people, the trends, the big ideas that will change our lives.
