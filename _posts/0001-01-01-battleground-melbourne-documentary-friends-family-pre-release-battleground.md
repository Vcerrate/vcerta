{% raw %}Battleground Melbourne tells the story of the Fall of the World's Most Liveable City, through the eyes of those who risked everything to save it.<br /><br />We've been called every name you can imagine, the media, politicians, and the 'I stand with Dan' crowd have used every baseless slur you can imagine, and probably many you can't, to try and shame us and shut us down.<br /><br />And Victoria Police went on an 18 month rampage of repression, unlawful arrests, and widespread intimidation in order to silence us.<br /><br />So who are we? And given all we were up against, how did we grow from just 70 people in April 2020, to hundreds of thousands in the biggest political events in Australian history in November 2021?<br /><br />This is our story, told through our eyes. Battleground Melbourne is our reply to the lies, half truths, slurs, and lazy attacks that we have endured for the last 2 years.<br /><br />This is our story. The story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things and taking extreme risks to stand for what we believe in.<br /><br />You may not agree with us, you may not even like us, but you can't claim to know who we are until you've watched Battleground Melbourne.{% endraw %}
