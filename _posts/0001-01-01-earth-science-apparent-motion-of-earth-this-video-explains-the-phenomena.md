{% raw %}This video explains the phenomena of Apparent Motion.  Early astronomers claimed the Earth was in the center of the universe and there is evidence to support that when you observe celestial motions from Earth.  However, Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler are responsible for changing that perspective and changing the world!{% endraw %}
