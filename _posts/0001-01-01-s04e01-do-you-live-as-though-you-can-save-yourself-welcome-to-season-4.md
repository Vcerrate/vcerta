{% raw %}Welcome to season 4 of the Deepen with Pastor Joby Martin podcast. We’re so excited to dive deeper into Pastor Joby’s new book, If The Tomb is Empty.<br /> <br />In this season, Pastor Joby is joined by his co-author, Charles Martin, and host Ali Parsons. We invite you into a conversation for the next seven weeks as they talk through the book, chapter by chapter, and how each event leads to Mount Calvary and the empty tomb. <br /> <br />In week one, they talk about Abraham and Isaac on Mount Moriah and ask the question, do you live as though you can save yourself?<br /> <br />Along with this podcast, we encourage you to listen or watch Pastor Joby teach through each week, correlated with chapters in the book. Watch or listen to sermons at coe22.com/sermons or subscribe to The Church of Eleven22 wherever you listen to podcasts.<br /><br />—<br />The Church of Eleven22™ is a movement for all people to discover and deepen a relationship with Jesus Christ.
