{% raw %}Tim Keller sermons via Gospel in Life: You can’t understand the real Jesus if you only look at his birth and his death— you must also look at his words and his deeds during his life. The gospel of John allows us to do that, and this passage in John 1 is one of the most rich and famous parts of the Bible. It begins with an amazing claim about “the Word.” What does it mean? We’ll examine this question under three headings: 1) A radical claim; 2) The rejection of that claim; and 3) The answer to the rejection.<br /><br />This sermon was preached by Rev. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 5, 2014.<br /><br />View the series: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gospelinlife.com/downloads/seeing-jesus/">https://gospelinlife.com/downloads/seeing-jesus/</a><br /><br />Scripture: John 1:1-14<br /><br />To receive a free book written by Dr. Timothy Keller, you can make a donation here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gospelinlife.com/youtube">https://gospelinlife.com/youtube</a>{% endraw %}
