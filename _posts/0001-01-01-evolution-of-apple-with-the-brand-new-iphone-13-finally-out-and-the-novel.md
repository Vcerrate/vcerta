{% raw %}With the brand new iPhone 13 finally out and the novel cinematic mode and 120Hz ProMotion display finally hitting the Pro version, it's interesting to see how the iPhone came to enter its current state. The first iPhone was introduced by Steve Jobs in 2007 as an iPod/Phone/Internet Communicator in ONE, and now it's a million different things too. It's a 3D scanner, a medical dictionary for Doctors, a fully fledged cinematic video camera and more.<br /><br />As well as the iPhone, the iPad, iPod, iMac, MacBook and Mac Pro have also become staples of modern Apple but these were completely different in the past. With different names such as PowerBook, iBook, Macintosh and PowerPC. Apple have developed so many innovations over the years, and this video takes you through them all.<br /><br />For business emails: magnifyevo@gmail.com<br /><br />Music:<br /><br />1.
