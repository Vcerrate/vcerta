The airline is notable for using the Singapore Girl as its central figure in corporate branding. It has been ranked as the world's best airline by Skytrax four times and topped Travel &amp; Leisure's best airline rankings for more than 20 years.<br /><br />About the Airbus A380 (from Wikipedia):<br />The Airbus A380 is a large wide-body airliner that was developed and produced by Airbus. It is the world's largest passenger airliner. Airbus studies started in 1988, and the project was announced in 1990 to challenge the dominance of the Boeing 747 in the long-haul market. The then-designated A3XX project was presented in 1994; Airbus launched the €9.5 billion ($10.7 billion) A380 program on 19 December 2000. The first prototype was unveiled in Toulouse on 18 January 2005, with its first flight on 27 April 2005. It then obtained its type certificate from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on 12 December 2006. Due to difficulties with the electrical wiring, the initial production was delayed by two years and the development costs almost doubled. It was first delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered service on 25 October.<br /><br />About Suites Class (from Wikipedia):<br />Singapore Airlines Suites is a class available only on the Airbus A380-800. Unveiled on 2 November 2017, the &quot;New A380 Suites&quot; are being progressively rolled out on the Airbus A380-800 fleet. They consist of six suites, manufactured by Zodiac Aerospace as separate compartments with walls and sliding doors in a 1-1 configuration on the forward upper deck. The suite itself consists of a free-standing seat and a separately deployable 76-inch (193 cm) flatbed, as well as a 32-inch (81 cm) touchscreen LCD TV, mounted on the sidewall. The leather seat, also upholstered by Poltrona Frau of Italy, is able to recline 45 degrees and rotate 360 degrees. The first two suites on either side of the aircraft can form a double bed after the privacy divider is lowered, similar to the old Suites product. Additional features include a separate wireless touchscreen control tablet located upon the credenza for controlling lighting, window blinds, and service calls, a Lalique personal amenity kit, an inbuilt personal closet and bag storage area, and a power socket and USB port all in a single panel. There is a dedicated spacious first-class lavatory on the second deck with additional Lalique amenities.<br /><br />This video and its sound are protected by YouTube copyright, ​and any unapproved use in other videos will be reported.{% endraw %}
