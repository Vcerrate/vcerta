Make it make sense. <br /><br />The acre of land the house sits on has its own tennis court, professional home movie theater, and a fitness room with a spa. All that for one person who is spending her days at the court house anyway. Yeah, she’s literally just using this place to rest her head at night. <br /><br />Witnesses in the neighborhood say they saw Amber along with her daughter, sister, and security detail. <br /><br />As you know, Amber’s now stuck with a judgment of over $8 million, and Elaine Bredehoft says Amber doesn’t have the money to pay Johnny. But she plans on appealing. That may be a struggle to come up with the money for the appeal because now she’s broke and blacklisted form Hollywood. <br /><br />Meanwhile, back at her Yucca Valley home, neighbours are “booing her”. Doing God’s work.<br /><br />Who knows? Maybe Amber pledged the rent? Or her baby daddy Elon Musk is paying for it? I just hope they checked the beds after she left.<br />What do you think of Amber Heard’s lavish spending?
