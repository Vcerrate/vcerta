{% raw %}Nice place to live in the Philippines Ilocos Sur.  Make ilocos sur your forever home.  Enjoy low crime rates, clean and friendly environment and the friendliest people you'll ever meet in the Philippines.  The ilocana people are very accommodating and very generous people.  We chose to move here from Manila because of the cleanliness and the quiet living.  My American husband compares it to like living the country life.  Cheaper land prices and cheaper to build house with Excell standards of quality.<br /><br />For more information please contact Karen&amp;Arless Dreamland Real Estate and Construction services.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/KAREN-AND-ARLE">https://www.facebook.com/KAREN-AND-ARLE</a> <br /><br />Hurry these lots will sell quick!
