Throughout it we're gonna be building on our last plot leak video and discussing all the new info that we now have on the movie.<br /><br />I wanna get straight into it but obviously, there will be some major spoilers here if these leaks turn out to be true and I can't cast a memory spell to make you forget anything so check out now if you don't want things ruined.<br /><br />With that out the way, huge thank you for clicking this, now let's get into the breakdown.<br /><br />Ok so if you've been following the channel for a while then you might have seen our last plot leak breakdown that we did all the way back in October detailing major elements of the movie. Since the trailers release it looks like the majority of these things are indeed true and though we know there's been some reshoots, it seems like the majority of the plot elements we talked about in that are still in place.<br /><br />Now if you've already watched that video and just wanna see us talk about the post credits scene then time codes will be linked below.<br /><br />The movie is basically gonna be a multiversal battle between Doctor Strange and Wanda as she attempts to take America Chavez's powers so that she can travel to a dimension in order to get her kids.<br /><br />Hide yo wife, hide yo kids, hide your human looking vibrator because the woman don't stop when it comes to getting what she wants.<br /><br />I don't wanna just go over old ground so if you want to have a beat by beat play on how the movie pans out then make sure you check out that plot leak video which will be linked on screen right now. This is mainly covering the new details we've heard about but as always take them with a pinch of salt as you know how things can get chewed up in the rumour mill.<br /><br />Now a new bit of info that we've learned since then is that the book of Vishanti will also play a big part in the film. You could probably figure this out from the trailers and the book even featured on the poster just behind Strange.<br /><br />It's basically the opposite of the darkhold and whereas that corrupts, Vishanti contains pure light and positive emotions like the feeling I get when someone hits the thumbs up button like Wanda wants to hit those Ultron bots.<br /><br />Goddamn so sexy.<br /><br /><br />â–º Artist Attribution<br />Music - LAKEY INSPIRED - The Process<br />SoundCloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired">https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lakeyinspired">https://www.instagram.com/lakeyinspired</a>{% endraw %}
