{% raw %}Sleep deprivation is a common problem in our modern 24/7 society due to social and economical demands. Loss of sleep negatively impacts the brain and particularly affects cognitive processes that require a brain region called the hippocampus. In this talk, Robbert will describe some of the mechanisms that go awry in the sleep-deprived brain and how they were able to make memory processes resilient to sleep deprivation.  Robbert is assistant professor at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. His research on the effects of sleep deprivation has been noticed and appreciated throughout the world. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
