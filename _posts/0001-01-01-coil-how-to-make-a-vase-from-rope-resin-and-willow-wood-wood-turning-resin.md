{% raw %}This project demonstrates the ultimate awesomeness of rope, incorporating it into a vase made from clear resin and willow wood.  It and other projects are being sold at ArtForOUR.org to help raise money for Operation Underground Railroad.  The vase is 11 inches tall and 10 inches wide. <br /><br />I basically spend my free time dreaming up ways to express my artistic side and simultanously to raise money for Operation Underground Railroad.  O.U.R. funds, supports, trains and guides rescue missions for children who are in sex trafficking slavery and free them to better lives with their amazing after care program.  We cannot support O.U.R. enough.
