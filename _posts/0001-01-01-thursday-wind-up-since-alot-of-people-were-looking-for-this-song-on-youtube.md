{% raw %}Since alot of people were looking for this song on youtube, I thought to myself.<br /><br />&quot;I might as well upload it&quot;<br /><br />So I did. LOL<br /><br /><br /><br />Well Enjoy. (  :<br /><br /><br /><br />LYRICS<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Just ahead I see you winding up<br /><br />And you're dressing this of color on the edge of fire<br /><br />until these tightened strides<br /><br />They march in time again<br /><br />I don't know where I will go<br /><br /><br /><br />I don't know, I don't know, I don't know if I will cut through<br /><br />I don't know, I don't know, if my heart will beat without you<br /><br /><br /><br />Guiding it, winding up<br /><br />Leading me, winding up to explode<br /><br /><br /><br />It's the sound your racing heart <br /><br />that beats in time with every start<br /><br />reaches up and across the sky<br /><br />It makes you want to rise<br /><br /><br /><br />Falling to pieces, I can't let go<br /><br />Tearing apart your lies<br /><br />Wanting to live<br /><br /><br /><br />Its the sound of your shotgun pulse<br /><br />beating over and over in your silent halls<br /><br />its the thought that keeps us alive <br /><br />it makes us want to try<br /><br /><br /><br />Falling to pieces, I can't let go<br /><br />Tearing apart your lies<br /><br />I want to live<br /><br /><br /><br />A scream to guide me<br /><br />through my life<br /><br />Winding up, Guiding me<br /><br />Winding up to what you cannot unwind this side of you<br /><br />And if its taken away you wont know what to do<br /><br />Your streatching to meet expectations<br /><br />That you will never reach<br /><br /><br /><br />And now its far too late, and now its far too late<br /><br />Far too late, to ever leave this cold<br /><br />I'm giving up, marching in time with their drums<br /><br />I'm letting go of everything I once loved{% endraw %}
