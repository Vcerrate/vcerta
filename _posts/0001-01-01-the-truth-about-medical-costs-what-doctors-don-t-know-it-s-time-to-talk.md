{% raw %}It's time to talk about medical costs in the US.  I came across this article and I was a little shocked by the results, which is why I decided to do a video on this, but also thought about it from my own perspective.  I am now more curious than ever as to why physicians don't know the costs of medical care that we are prescribing and providing.  It's odd to say the least, but that is the US Healthcare system.  Curious to see what you all think about this video...<br /><br />03:18 - Specialties with Lowest knowledge of costs<br />03:44 - Specialty with Most knowledge of costs<br />04:00 - Primary Care and medical costs<br />05:46 - Specialists knowledge of medical costs<br />06:30 - Physicians by Age<br />07:30 - Do I know medical costs in my specialty?<br />08:35 - What we‚Äôre doing to fix this<br /><br />Link to Article:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.doximity.com/articles/e2aae031-c78f-431c-a5cc-1a68658282e8">https://www.doximity.com/articles/e2aae031-c78f-431c-a5cc-1a68658282e8</a><br /><br />CMS Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency">https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency</a><br /><br />Patient Rights Advocate:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patientrightsadvocate.org/semi-annual-compliance-report-2022">https://www.patientrightsadvocate.org/semi-annual-compliance-report-2022</a><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiPW7OlzTfQjR_vLlkYPZCg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiPW7OlzTfQjR_vLlkYPZCg/join</a><br /><br />Join the Dr. Cellini Family:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/DrCellini">https://tinyurl.com/DrCellini</a><br />______<br />CONTACT ME:<br /><br />üì∏  Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/drcellini">https://instagram.com/drcellini</a><br />üìπ  TikTok - @DrCellini<br />üê¶  Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/dr_cellini">https://twitter.com/dr_cellini</a><br />üìß  Email:  TheDrCellini@gmail.com<br />-----------<br />ü•º My Scrubs:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wearfigs.com">https://www.wearfigs.com</a><br />-----------<br />MY TOOLS &amp; GEAR:<br />üé•  My YouTube Camera Gear - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/drcellini">https://www.amazon.com/shop/drcellini</a><br />‚å®Ô∏è  My Keyboard - Wireless F96 KAT mechanical keyboard - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://iqunix.store/drcellini">http://iqunix.store/drcellini</a><br />üéµ  Where I get ALL of My Music from Epidemic Sound! -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/25q7o4/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/25q7o4/</a><br /><br />My Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2GX4whr">https://amzn.to/2GX4whr</a><br />My Lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2C7NYxt">https://amzn.to/2C7NYxt</a><br />Camera Tripod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LUABWf">https://amzn.to/2LUABWf</a><br />Memory Card: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LVjtPZ">https://amzn.to/2LVjtPZ</a><br /><br />**As an Amazon Associate I earn commission with use of the above links on qualifying purchases**<br />-----------<br /><br />OTHER STUFF:<br /><br />üí∞ Buy BITCOIN here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/cellin_vu">https://www.coinbase.com/join/cellin_vu</a><br /><br />üì¨  Business Inquiries -- Email:  TheDrCellini@gmail.com<br /><br />*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.
