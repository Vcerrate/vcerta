{% raw %}The old sawying has it the two things you can't avoid are death and taxes. There's a third - exams! As we come to the end of the Fall Semester, this Forum is devoted to the art and science of exam-taking. A panel of students discuss their tips on outlining and studying, followed by questions from the floor. Then, Professor Friedman gives his well-honed talk, The Pinball Theory of Exam-Taking, a comprehensive primer on how to succeed in writing law-school exams. And more questions from the floor.<br /><br /><br /><br />Barry Friedman, Vice Dean, Jacob D. Fuchsberg Professor of Law<br /><br /><br /><br />Ben Stoll, Class of 2010<br /><br /><br /><br />Carmen Iguina, Class of 2010<br /><br /><br /><br />Allison Westfahl-Kong, Class of 2010{% endraw %}
