{% raw %}yes, you read that right! 10,000 steps we are doing together today! Its going to test your endurance, and its going to be intense, but don’t you worry I have input some water break checkpoints in there to help you check in with yourself and as a marking point for where you can come back to the workout and try to surpass it! <br /><br />If you’re committing to doing the full 10,000 steps with me today, make sure that you have a cushy mat or shoes to protect your soles. This is a long walk and will take some extra effort from your calves and pressure in your feet.<br /><br />As always, take this workout at your own pace. I personally like to stay on beat to keep my body moving but if you are unable to follow the beat, its totally okay! Find your own beat, your own style, your own groove!<br /><br /> <br />Workout Structure:<br />WARM UP (10 Mins)<br />Upper Body Exercises (5 Mins)<br />Lower Body Exercises (5 Mins)<br />WATER BREAK/CHECKPOINT 1 (1 Min)<br />Explosive Cardio (5 Mins)<br />Agility (5 Mins)<br />Strength (5 mins)<br />WATER BREAK/CHECKPOINT 2 (1 Min)<br />Upper Body (5 Mins)<br />Lower Body (5 Mins)<br />Strength (5 Mins)<br />WATER BREAK/CHECKPOINT 3 (1 Min)<br />Have Fun With it (5 Mins)<br />Fiery Finisher (4 Mins)<br />COOL DOWN (5 Mins)<br /><br />Workout Stats:<br />Apple Watch Setting: Indoor Walk<br />Calories Burned: 670<br />Intensity Level: 9/10<br /><br />Here is your reminder to give yourself grace today and check in with your body. Make sure that you continue to breathe not only during this workout but in your day-to-day. Take deep breaths. Take it one day at a time.  You’ve got this<br /><br />If you’ve read up until here, comment below letting me know what you do daily to get your steps in and how you are going to remind yourself to breathe during this workout and in your day-to-day.
