In the middle of the night, my daughter and I were were awoken by lack of breath. We dashed out. He was out as well, when he saw us, he tried to grab us to return us to the fire but we overpowered him since he was drunk. ğŸ˜“ğŸ˜“ğŸ˜“ğŸ˜“<br /><br />That is when it dawned to me that I had been living with a man who hated me, who wanted me dead! He would deny me sex, then accuse me of infidelity and would beat me so bad! Yet for all those years, I knew no other man but himğŸ˜¥ğŸ˜¥ğŸ˜¥ğŸ˜¥<br />One day, I just walked out, never to return! <br /><br />Here is my story,â€™ Josphine{% endraw %}
