{% raw %}It's For the Best by Straylight Run<br /><br /><br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />it takes more time than I've ever had<br /><br />drains the life from me<br /><br />makes me want to forget<br /><br />as young as I was<br /><br />I felt older back then<br /><br />more disciplined, stronger and certain<br /><br />but I was scared to death of eternity<br /><br />I was saved by grace but destroyed by naivety<br /><br />and I lied to myself<br /><br />and said it was for the best<br /><br /><br /><br />and now faith is replaced with a logic so cold <br /><br />I've disregarded what I was<br /><br />now that I'm older<br /><br />and I know much more than I did back then<br /><br />but the more I learn<br /><br />the more I can't understand<br /><br />and I've become content with this life that I lead<br /><br />where I drink to much and don't believe in much of anything<br /><br />and I lie to myself<br /><br />and say it's for the best<br /><br /><br /><br />we're moving forward<br /><br />but holding ourselves back<br /><br />and we're waiting on something that will never come{% endraw %}
