{% raw %}The Chicago Blackhawks turned superstars into a dynasty, and a dynasty into an impossible standard. By the time the “Baby Blackhawks” lost to Detroit in the 2009 Western Conference Finals, Forbes Magazine already hailed the franchise as “the greatest sports-business turnaround ever.” <br /><br />Three Cups in five years, led by two young superstars and a dynamic core of supporting players. Chicago had already completed one dynasty, and there was no reason this group couldn’t keep going at a Championship level. But, even superstars can’t do it alone.<br /><br />Written and produced by Steven Godfrey<br />Edited by Charlotte Atkinson<br />Graphics by Tyson Whiting<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/Nbabae">http://goo.gl/Nbabae</a> <br />Enter the Secret Base: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sbnation.com/secret-base">http://www.sbnation.com/secret-base</a> <br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/secretbase">https://twitter.com/secretbase</a> <br />Follow us on Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/secretbasesbn">https://www.twitch.tv/secretbasesbn</a> <br />Follow us on Tiktok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@secretbasesbn?">https://www.tiktok.com/@secretbasesbn?</a> <br />Check out our full video catalog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/9pMHRV">http://goo.gl/9pMHRV</a> <br />Visit our playlists: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/NvpZFF">http://goo.gl/NvpZFF</a> <br />Explore SB Nation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sbnation.com">http://www.sbnation.com</a>{% endraw %}
