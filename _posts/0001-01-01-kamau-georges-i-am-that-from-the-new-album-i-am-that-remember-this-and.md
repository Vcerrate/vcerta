{% raw %}“I Am That” by Kamau Georges, from his new album ‘I Am That! Remember This and Be Happy’: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.org/music/kamau-i-am-that">https://mooji.org/music/kamau-i-am-that</a><br /><br />This immensely joyful new album, I Am That! is a vibrant blend of Afro-Caribbean calypso-like music infused with a powerful spiritual message. A must listen!<br /><br />I Am That! is a witty, light-hearted and uplifting celebration of Truth being discovered inside the Heart—it is a bliss arrow that infuses itself inside one’s entire body and being, taking you on a playful lyrical and musical journey towards spiritual freedom. You may easily find yourself moving in a calypso-like rhythm while your heart fills up with a joy of the highest kind. <br /><br />This fresh and energising album from Kamau Georges—a prolific and highly gifted musician, songwriter and vocalist—is inspired and infused by the loving pointers of Mooji, Kamau’s spiritual mentor, whose spoken words of wisdom are featured throughout the album.<br /><br />It is Kamau’s intention that his music will help you to begin your day smiling and dancing while being wonderfully reminded of your real nature and Being.<br /><br />“This music is very fresh, direct and playful, yet deep at the same time. It is childlike and so full of happiness. And Kamau is very much like this: his presence exudes love, Truth and God’s joyous Grace. May this refreshing music bring much happiness and profound reflection and be a real gift to the world, for it is full of joy, full of power, full of the love and the light-filled spirit of Kamau.” <br />                                                                                                                                            ~ Mooji<br /><br />Available on all major online platforms such as iTunes and Spotify, and on a ‘pay as you feel’ basis from the Mooji Sangha Shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.mooji.org/product/music/kamau-i-am-that/">https://shop.mooji.org/product/music/kamau-i-am-that/</a><br /><br />I Am That! album: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.org/music/kamau-i-am-that">https://mooji.org/music/kamau-i-am-that</a><br />Mooji Mala Music page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.org/music">https://mooji.org/music</a><br /><br />The 'I Am That' album was recorded and produced by Kamau Georges. <br />The spoken word by Mooji was recorded by Mooji’s Team in Portugal.<br /><br />To support these offerings and the worldwide sharing of Satsang, you can donate here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.org/donate?tcode=mmm1">https://mooji.org/donate?tcode=mmm1</a><br /><br />#iamthat #moojimalamusic #moojimusic #kamaugeorges #calypso #satsongs #joy #AfroCaribbean{% endraw %}
