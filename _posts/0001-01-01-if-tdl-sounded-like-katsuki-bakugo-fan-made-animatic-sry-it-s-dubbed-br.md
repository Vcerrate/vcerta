{% raw %}Sry it's dubbed<br /><br />Soo whose voice do you imagine The Chosen One having? XD<br /><br />* Also, the &quot;white&quot; stickman is an anonymous stickman. I cannot bring myself to give any of Alan's stickmen the role of Midnight XD<br /><br />~<br /><br />Audio from My Hero Academia / Boku no Hero Academia<br /><br />Programs used:<br />Alight Motion<br />Ibis Paint X<br /><br />‚ö†Ô∏é Characters do NOT belong to me. This is a fan-made animation with no intent to steal characters. The Dark Lord and the other stickmen belong to Alan Becker on Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/noogai89">https://www.youtube.com/c/noogai89</a><br /><br />‚ö†Ô∏é Do NOT repost my videos or claim them as your own. Especially DO NOT repost on other social media platforms! <br /><br />You can add my videos in YouTube compilations or stuff as long as you credit Alan Becker for the characters and my channel for the fan-made content. A link to my channel in your video description will also make me very happy üëç For your convenience: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNGlX4G_r--vKMqpkEL_sQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNGlX4G_r--vKMqpkEL_sQ</a><br /><br />Have a good one üëã{% endraw %}
