That’s my personal issue.<br />Then we have joint pain - such as the knees, elbows, shoulders and the hand + wrist area. For me, it’s for sure my shoulders and knees, and in the past few years - elbow pain as well.<br />So, what are the primary causes of such pain - especially this more long-term, chronic pain?<br />Well, there are a couple of reasons, but the underlying cause is usually the same in almost all cases and I’ll tell you what that is in a minute.<br />For the joint pain, it’s can be wear and tear. For me, it’s years of sports and weight lifting.<br /><br />The cause is also due to less fluid, collagen and similar substances around the joints, ligaments and tendons.<br /><br /><br />For muscular pain, such as low back pain - it can be muscle tightness and less fluid in the muscles. This gives you that tight feeling.<br />However, an underlying cause of all of this is inflammation.<br />And the cause of inflammation has many different factors. <br />Hormonal imbalances are one. <br />Lack of stem cells is another. <br />Lifestyle factors, such as diet, type of exercise and stress. <br />And yes, simple aging is a factor and this is why scientists have coined the term, “inflamAGING”<br />And if you recall from some of my previous videos, I went to Panama a couple of years ago, spent $30K and did full body stem cells – the same place Mel Gibson, Tony Robbins and various professional athletes went to.<br />Of course, I don’t expect you or many people to do something so extreme and of course, expensive. But, it did work really well for at least a year. Now, 2 years later, some of the pain is back again.<br />I do take various supplements to help with inflammation. The best ones have been fish oil and “Inflame &amp; Pain Relief”. I’ve put the links below in the description area.<br />I do follow an anti-inflammatory diet. It’s too complicated to get into the details in this video, but I’ve posted links below to this, in the description area.<br />And I’ll go into details about an anti-inflammatory lifestyle in future videos - so, make sure you’re subscribed to this channel and click the notification icon as well.<br />If you are overweight, simply losing some excess fat will help reduce the pain and inflammation.<br />Sleep is also very important and most people aren’t getting enough sleep, especially deep, quality REM sleep.<br />Getting enough sunlight and Vitamin D and K is also very important.<br />Massage is also very helpful. But, it needs to be done weekly and it can, of course, it can get expensive over time.<br />Forget about taking pain medications such as NSAIDs, Ibuprofen, Advil, Acetaminophen, Tylenol and similar drugs - the effects are temporary and will cause your MORE pain when you get off of them and you HAVE to get off of them sooner or later since they are so liver and kidney toxic.<br />Then we have steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as prednisone and similar corticoid/cortisol drugs. These are literally STRESS pills, which due reduce inflammation temporarily but cause massive damage to the body AND brain. Horrible drugs that kill your muscles, increase body fat, blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol and so on and so forth.<br />But, a small percentage of people need to them to live. 99% of us don’t.<br /><br />==============­<br />Thank you for watching.
