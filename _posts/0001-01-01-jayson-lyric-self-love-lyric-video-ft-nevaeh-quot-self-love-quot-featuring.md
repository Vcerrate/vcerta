This process may look different for everyone and you have to learn how to love yourself as an individual. There is an epidemic of low self-worth, mostly because of things depicted on social media and within the media. Self love is more than just changing your hair, changing your wardrobe, or attempting to redefine yourself. Self love is about learning to appreciate yourself physically, emotionally, and spiritually. The record has a double meaning, not only loving yourself mentality but also physically. Jayson Lyric believes self care is a huge component of self love. It builds self awareness, self worth, and self esteem. Remember loving yourself is not selfish, therefore, find daily routines to treat yourself and to find a deeper connection of self.<br /><br />Copyright (C) 2021 NHPENT{% endraw %}
