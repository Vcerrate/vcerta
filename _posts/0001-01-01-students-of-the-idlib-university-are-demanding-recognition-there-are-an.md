{% raw %}There are an estimate number of 20 thousand students actively studying at the Idlib University. The students have the option to study in the different departments and faculties of the university like engineering, medicine, law, language, management or some of the other options available. <br /><br />We were able to visit the English faculty of the university. An estimate number of 900 students are studying actively at the faculty. The lecturers at the university are very keen to share their knowledge with the students especially because these young men and women are the future for the liberated areas.<br /><br />#idlib #university{% endraw %}
