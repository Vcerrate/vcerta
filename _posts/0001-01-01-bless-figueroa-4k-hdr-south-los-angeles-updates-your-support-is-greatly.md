Wesson, Jr. declared that Figueroa Street will become Kobe Bryant Boulevard between Olympic Boulevard and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, including the part of Figueroa Street that Staples Center is on.<br /><br />Route<br />Figueroa Street (left), Harbor Freeway (center), and S Broadway (right) night aerial from the south, with downtown Los Angeles in the distance. Figueroa Street turns and become less visible at the University of Southern California.<br />One of the longer streets in the city, it runs in a north/south direction for more than 30 miles (48 km) from its southern terminus at Harry Bridges Boulevard in the Wilmington neighborhood to Chevy Chase Drive in the city of La Cañada Flintridge at the north end.<br /><br />From its south end at Harry Bridges Boulevard to Downtown Los Angeles, Figueroa Street runs north parallel to the Harbor Freeway (Interstate 110) in South Los Angeles. The only portion of this segment of Figueroa Street that lies outside Los Angeles city limits is in the city of Carson. South of the Los Angeles Financial District, Figueroa Street passes well-known locations including the University of Southern California, the Los Angeles Convention Center, and Staples Center/L.A. Live.<br /><br />After passing through downtown Los Angeles near Bunker Hill and South Park, the southern portion of Figueroa Street ends near the overcrossing of Sunset Boulevard over the Arroyo Seco Parkway (SR 110) in Chinatown. The northern portion of the street resumes at San Fernando Road in Cypress Park. An early routing of Figueroa Street in this area was originally part of U.S. Route 66, today a part of the Arroyo Seco Parkway (State Route 110). The noted Figueroa Street Tunnels were once a part of that same stretch of roadway.<br /><br />After resuming at San Fernando Road, Figueroa continues to run roughly parallel to the Arroyo Seco Parkway until it reaches York Boulevard in Highland Park. Afterwards, it heads north to its terminus near the Scholl Canyon Landfill just past its junction with the Ventura Freeway (State Route 134) in Eagle Rock. A short, unconnected continuation of Figueroa Street runs from a residential area just south of Marengo Drive in Glendale to end at Chevy Chase Drive just over the city limit line in La Cañada Flintridge.<br /><br />Early maps produced by the Automobile Club of Southern California measured distances to Los Angeles from the club's headquarters at the intersection of Figueroa Street with Adams Boulevard.<br /><br />On April 2, 2011, a portion of Figueroa Street at Jefferson Boulevard was blocked off for the &quot;Orange Carpet&quot; and the grandstand for the broadcasting of the 2011 Kids' Choice Awards.<br /><br />In South Los Angeles, Figueroa Street has the highest number of prostitution-related arrests in Los Angeles.<br /><br />History<br />Entrance of Grammy Museum at L.A. Live<br />Figueroa was originally called Calle de los Chapules (or Grasshopper Street). Chapules (or chapul in the singular form) is not the standard Spanish word for grasshopper which is saltamonte. Chapul is from the Nahuatl of Durango and Nayarit (also known as Mexicanero) and means grasshopper.[3] Later in the 1880s it became known as &quot;Pearl Street&quot;. Figueroa Street originally was a few blocks west of Pearl but joined Pearl Street further south. Pearl Street was changed to Figueroa and the northern portion of the old Figueroa Street was renamed Boylston.[4] The section of what is now Figueroa in Highland Park above Avenue 39 was known as &quot;Pasadena Avenue&quot; until Figueroa was extended through Elysian Park. The portion of what is now Figueroa between the Los Angeles River and Avenue 39 was originally known as Dayton Avenue until the Arroyo Parkway went through.[5] Prior to construction of the Harbor Freeway, Figueroa St. carried U.S. Route 6 to Pacific Coast Highway south from the Four-Level Interchange.<br /><br />#figueroastreet #southcentral #drivingtour{% endraw %}
