{% raw %}Written and sung by David Ball, this is a wonderful Country Swing style that David was good at singing/writing for. I hear Uncle Walt liked the silliness of the song, and tended to goof on it in live performances. An example was at one show, when the line &quot;Faster driver won't you please&quot; came, Uncle Walt stuck in the quip &quot;I can't get in out of second gear&quot;. Got to love him.{% endraw %}
