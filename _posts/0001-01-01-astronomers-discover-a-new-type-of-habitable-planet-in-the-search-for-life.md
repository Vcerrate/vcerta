{% raw %}In the search for life beyond our planet, researchers have recently identified a new type of habitable world. &quot;Hycean&quot; planets, which are up to 2.5 times larger than Earth and feature huge oceans of liquid water beneath hydrogen-rich atmospheres are prime candidates for life. <br /><br />&quot;Hycean planets open a whole new avenue in our search for life elsewhere,&quot; lead researcher Nikku Madhusudhan, of the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge in England, said in a statement.<br /><br />Welcome to Factnomenal! In todayâ€™s video we explore the chances that these wondrous exoplanets are not only abundant, but have life quite different from what we see around us. As we close in on the James Webb Telescope opening its golden eye to the universe, an equally golden opportunity to search for extraterrestrial life is coming with it. <br /><br />And now we know just where to look.<br /> <br /><br />  <br /><br />Buy us a coffee to show your support!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Factnomenal">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Factnomenal</a>  <br /><br />DON'T CLICK THIS LINK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/357shs3j">https://tinyurl.com/357shs3j</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching Factnomenal!<br />ðŸŒŽ Subscribe for more space discoveries, space facts, and space in general!<br />ðŸ”” Hit the bell next to subscribe so you never miss a video!<br /><br /><br />â–º For copyright matters, make sure to send us an email to Adam@trustedmiddle.com<br /><br />#Factnomenal #Space #ExtraterrestrialLife{% endraw %}
