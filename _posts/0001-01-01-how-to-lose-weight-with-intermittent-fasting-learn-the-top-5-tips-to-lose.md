Why not try intermittent fasting to lose weight fast? While you may only want to lose 20lbs or even 40lbs, some people have lost as much as 125 pounds! Discover why this method is good for your health.<br /><br />5. Start with a small fasting period.<br />There are several ways to implement intermittent fasting. Some of the most popular ones include the 16:8 method, the 5:2 diet, Leangains, eat-stop-eat and alternate-day fasting (ADF). If in doubt, it‚Äôs best to start with a 12-hour fast and followed by a 12-hour eating window.<br /><br />4. Break your fast slowly and steadily.<br />After going several hours with no food consumption, you might feel you could eat up an entire mountain. However, it‚Äôs recommended that you take your time to chew well and eat slowly after a fast, to allow your digestive system to process the food, causing no imbalances.<br /><br />3. Drink a lot of water.<br />Staying well hydrated is an important part of succeeding with intermittent fasting. The best drinks to consume during a fast are free from calories and sweeteners like still or sparkling water, and tea or coffee with no additives.<br /><br />2. Choose nutrient-dense foods.<br />After a fast, it‚Äôs important to supply your body with foods that are high in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients which can help to keep blood sugar levels steady and prevent nutrient deficiencies. Examples are chicken breast, fish, leafy greens, nuts and eggs.<br /><br />1. Keep yourself busy.<br />It‚Äôs important to keep your mind busy during your usual meal or snack times while you‚Äôre fasting.<br /><br />By following these tips, you will set yourself up for results, and be much more likely to be serious about incorporating intermittent fasting in your daily routine. The benefits of intermittent fasting go way beyond reducing obesity, the anti-aging benefits include disease treatment and prevention, and increasing longevity.<br /><br />To get your IF meal plan, sign up for our free beginner's guide and see how much fat you can burn in one month:  ‚è©  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dailyhealthpost.co/if-guide">https://dailyhealthpost.co/if-guide</a><br /><br />To get diet tips for weight loss, and how to optimize your fitness, nutrition and lifestyle, so you can feel amazing naturally, subscribe to our channel ‚Üí <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dailyhealthpost.co/subscribe">https://dailyhealthpost.co/subscribe</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />------------<br />00:00 Intro<br />01:01 Start with a small fasting period<br />01:59 Break your fast slowly and steadily<br />02:47 Drink a lot of water<br />03:17 Choose nutrient-dense foods<br />03:58 Keep yourself busy<br />04:52 Why does intermittent fasting work?<br />05:38 What are the benefits of autophagy?<br />06:11 How does fasting trigger autophagy?<br />06:41 How long do you have to fast before autophagy starts?<br />07:20 Other means to trigger autophagy<br />07:55 100% FREE &quot;How to Lose Weight with Intermittent Fasting&quot; Guide<br /><br />What is your weight before and after doing intermittent fasting?
