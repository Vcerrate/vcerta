{% raw %}Max is attacking the concept that you’re either an artist OR a business person. <br /><br /><br /><br />Max Pepe spent the first 8 years of his career in the music industry, touring and recording with two successful rock bands, played over 1,000 shows and recorded albums in UK and US with highly acclaimed multi platinum selling producers.<br /><br /><br /><br />In 2012 Max started a digital marketing agency. In just three years he grew a team from 2 people to 30, and drove 800% growth year on year. This lead to Max being recognised as one of 6 digital industry leaders by one of the UK’s largest and most successful digital marketing publications. <br /><br /><br /><br />Max now believes there is a massive disconnect between the world of business and the world of creativity. To address this problem, Max has just set up a highly ambitious media company called Rebelhead Entrepreneurs, aiming to change the face of traditional business press and provide a new breed of creative entrepreneur with an unrivalled platform of inspiration, motivation and education.<br /><br /><br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
