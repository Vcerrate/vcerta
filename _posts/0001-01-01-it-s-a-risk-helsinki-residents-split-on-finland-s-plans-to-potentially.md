{% raw %}Vladimir Putin told the President of Finland he has 'made a mistake' by joining NATO as the country faces 'no security threats'. In a speech on the 80th day of the war in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: 'The collective West has announced a total hybrid war on us. 'It is difficult to forecast how long this will all last, but it is clear that the consequences will be felt by everybody without exception. The Kremlin attack dog added: 'We've done everything to avoid a direct clash but the challenge has been thrown to us and we accept it.Â Cancel culture against everything Russia is being used against us. We are doing everything we can to defend the interests of our citizens abroad. Ukraine is an instrument, a tool, to contain Russia's peaceful development.'<br />#Finland #NATO #Russia<br /><br />Original Article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10815861/Russia-threatens-nuke-Britain-Satan-2-missile-just-200-seconds-Finland-10-seconds.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10815861/Russia-threatens-nuke-Britain-Satan-2-missile-just-200-seconds-Finland-10-seconds.html</a><br />Original Video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/finland/video-2685999/Video-Helsinki-residents-split-Finlands-plans-potentially-join-NATO.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/finland/video-2685999/Video-Helsinki-residents-split-Finlands-plans-potentially-join-NATO.html</a><br /><br />Daily Mail Homepage:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/</a><br /><br />Daily Mail Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/dailymail">https://facebook.com/dailymail</a><br />Daily Mail IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/dailymail">https://instagram.com/dailymail</a><br />Daily Mail Snap: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033">https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033</a><br />Daily Mail Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MailOnline">https://twitter.com/MailOnline</a><br />Daily Mail Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail">https://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail</a><br /><br />Get the free Daily Mail mobile app: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dailymail.co.uk/mobile">https://dailymail.co.uk/mobile</a>{% endraw %}
