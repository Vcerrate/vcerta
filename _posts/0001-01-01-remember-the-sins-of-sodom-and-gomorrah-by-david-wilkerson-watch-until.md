{% raw %}Watch until the end as David Wilkerson preaches about how God will judge just like in the days of Noah and the days of Sodom and Gomorrah.<br /><br />Luke 17 : 26 - 33 |<br /><br />“Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.<br /><br />“It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.<br /><br />“It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed. On that day no one who is on the housetop, with possessions inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything. Remember Lot’s wife! Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it.<br /><br />This video may contain copyrighted material; The use of which has not been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.
