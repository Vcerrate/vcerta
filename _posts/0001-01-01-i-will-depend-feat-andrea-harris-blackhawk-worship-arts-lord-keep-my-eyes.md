{% raw %}Lord keep my eyes fixed on the prize<br />Sun on my face, walking in grace<br />I will depend, I will look up<br />I will keep trusting You<br />//<br />&quot;The words of this song bring so much peace to my soul. Whenever I need God, I'm able to call on his name and know that he'll be there and he cares. Being able to depend on God is not always easy, but when you know you can depend on the source of all things, it's so refreshing and fulfilling. God takes care of every one of my cares and every one of my needs.&quot; â€“Andrea Harris{% endraw %}
