{% raw %}#ericthomas #apoc #faith<br /><br />The Lord has plans for you. Our goal shouldn’t only be to read and know the word, but to know the author of the word, and intentionally build a relationship with him. <br /><br />Like many of us, in his early experience Peter had a one sided relationship with Jesus. The relationship was great when it didn’t cost Peter anything. Following God will cost you something. Whether that’s faith, certain behaviors or mindsets, or people. <br /><br />8:55 - Steward the relationship you have with God and others. Failure to do so heightens the chances of self sabotaging what’s important. With the enemy out to kill, steal and destroy, it’s vital to evaluate your surroundings determining if it’s conducive to growing in God. <br /><br />15:30 - Are you complacent or committed in your relationships?<br /><br />17:16 - It is difficult to execute when you’re not fully committed.<br /><br /><br />Types of Love Exemplified <br />1. Association - Only around for what someone can provide for you. <br />2. Unconditional - Around someone no matter what the situation is. <br /><br />To learn more and to support A Place of Change Ministry please visit us @www.apocministry.org.{% endraw %}
