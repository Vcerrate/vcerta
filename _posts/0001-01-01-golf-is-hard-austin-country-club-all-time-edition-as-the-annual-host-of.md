The World Golf Championships - Dell Technologies Match Play also marks the return of 2020 U.S. Open winner Bryson DeChambeau, who hasn’t played since The Farmers Insurance Open in January due to a wrist injury. The top five players in the world including Jon Rahn, Collin Morikawa, Viktor Hovland, Patrick Cantlay and Scottie Scheffler will all enter the 64-man field which will be split into 16 groups of four players for round-robin play. After round-robin play concludes, the player with the highest amount of points from each group will move onto single-elimination play, where the matches will continue until a champion is crowned.<br /><br /><br /><br />Welcome to the Official YouTube channel of the European Tour.
