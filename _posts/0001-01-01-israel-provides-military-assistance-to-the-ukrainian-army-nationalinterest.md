{% raw %}#NationalInterest<br />#News<br />Israel provides military assistance to the Ukrainian army<br /><br />Israel has become involved in the current situation in Ukraine, speaking on the side of Kyiv. As it became known, the Israeli side is providing some military assistance to the Ukrainian army and volunteers, which indicates that Israel has gone to a confrontation with Russia, although Israeli sources have previously stated that there are no such intentions.<br /><br />Information about Israel's involvement in providing assistance to the Ukrainian military and volunteers appeared against the backdrop of an open appeal from one of the Israeli volunteer taking part in hostilities on the side of Ukraine. In his address, he openly thanks the Israeli side for providing assistance in Hebrew.<br />At the moment, the Israeli side does not comment on the information about the provision of military assistance to Ukraine, however, experts note that it is not only about providing uniforms and protective equipment, but also about providing operational satellite intelligence data.<br /><br />Experts draw attention to the fact that if the data on Israeli intervention is confirmed, then Russia can take appropriate steps to create difficulties for the Israeli military during operations in Syria.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />IMPORTANT!<br />None of these images, music &amp; video clips were created/owned by us.<br />This video is purely fan-made, if you (owners) have seen your content and want to remove this video, please message us privately or mail us : (newtropicalhouse@gmail.com) before doing anything.
