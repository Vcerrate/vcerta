{% raw %}Hey guys! Hope ye are well - it's been a couple of weeks. My sister was home from America so we took some time off to spend with her since it will be a couple of years before she'll be home again. <br /><br />We got silage cut and in the pit in the meantime. We have one pit covered with tyres and one pit with a cloth/ratchet system. This video isn't sponsored in any way. We purchased the system ourselves before silage last summer. Some of you might have seen us taking it apart during the winter when feeding the cows.<br /><br />Really hope ye enjoy the video. Please give the video a thumbs up if ye do and hit the subscribe button to follow along.<br /><br />Thanks again for watching!<br /><br />Lots of love,<br />PK, MK, Baby K &amp; Freya xx<br /><br /><br /><br />Music by <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/ikson">https://youtube.com/ikson</a><br /><br />Track: Ikson - Summer [Official] Music provided by Ikson® Listen: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ediBvHnY8S0">https://youtu.be/ediBvHnY8S0</a><br /><br />Track: Ikson - Summer [Official]<br />Music provided by Ikson® <br />Listen: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ediBvHnY8S0">https://youtu.be/ediBvHnY8S0</a>{% endraw %}
