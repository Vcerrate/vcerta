{% raw %}Spend the day with @emma chamberlain in Paris- where life consists of 10 coffees a day, discovering her newly-found love for museums, and attending the Louis Vuitton fashion show. Being in Paris is all about 'feeling fancy,' roaming the streets, and curating outfits from vintage shops that scream designer chic. Emma takes us on a rendezvous to show what goes into the glam process before a fashion show, how her style has changed now that she has gotten older, and her favorite things to do in Paris, all while attempting to turn Harper’s BAZAAR into a prank channel.  <br /><br />Digital Director: Nikki Ogunnaike <br />Supervising Producer: Amanda DiMartino<br />Post-Production Supervisor: Erica Dillman <br />Director: Caroline Gaimari<br />Director of Photography: Pierre Warolin<br />Camera Assistant: Sarah Tcheurekdjian <br />Sound Engineer: David Amsellem <br />Editors: Jeffrey Thomson &amp; Michael Pietrzyk<br />Don't miss out on the latest must-see video  ►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoBAZAAR">http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoBAZAAR</a><br /><br />// ABOUT BAZAAR //<br />Sophisticated, elegant, and provocative, Harper's BAZAAR is your source for everything beauty and skincare, and the latest fashion trends straight from the runway.
