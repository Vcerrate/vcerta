The Sixty-Four was designed from the ground up with the lowrider, auto enthusiast, and R/C scaler communities in mind.<br /><br />Every detail of the Sixty-Four was painstakingly and passionately created with scale accuracy and detail in mind. The Impala SS interior and exterior badging adorn the beautiful 1964 Impala SS body and interior. 23 individual chrome plated molded parts are used to create the body‚Äôs chrome accessories. Optional LED lights are available for nighttime cruising. Clear windows feature high-quality chrome foil trim to complete the ultra-realistic appearance. The attention to detail continues below the body, with the chassis frame, faux transmission, and functional solid rear axle with removable differential cover.<br /><br />The Sixty-Four is designed for slow cruising and performing tricks that you can only do with special hydraulically actuated suspensions. Using specialty servos and precision weight bias, it replicates the driving style and overall look of a full-sized lowrider/hopper.<br /><br />üöó<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rclowriders.com">https://www.rclowriders.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.redcatracing.com/products/sixtyfour">https://www.redcatracing.com/products/sixtyfour</a><br /><br />Follow Redcat on social media!<br />üëç<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/redcatracing/">https://www.facebook.com/redcatracing/</a><br />üì∑<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/redcatracing/">https://www.instagram.com/redcatracing/</a><br />üê¶<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/redcatracing">https://twitter.com/redcatracing</a>{% endraw %}
