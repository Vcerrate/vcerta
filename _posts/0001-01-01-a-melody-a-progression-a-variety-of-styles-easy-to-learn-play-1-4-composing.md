{% raw %}Composing your own melody is fun and useful. You then put your own chords to it and would do well to apply different rhythms. If you can't yet do that, then I offer my own melody and chords for you to easily learn. It's only five bars and hopefully a few new chords for you. In each next video of the series, I'll play this same melody/chords in a different style: jazz, blues, bossa, pop, etc. and hope to share the techniques and traits of each. See you on the journey!<br />---<br />Video Management Website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dan-the-composer.com">https://www.dan-the-composer.com</a><br /><br />7 Important Playlists:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://piano-jazz.blogspot.com/2020/02/guided-channel-playlist-tour.html">http://piano-jazz.blogspot.com/2020/02/guided-channel-playlist-tour.html</a><br /><br />Playlist for beginners - newer videos:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cPpP-Ua6NWl43cy2XiArwodqSmWBOzC">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cPpP-Ua6NWl43cy2XiArwodqSmWBOzC</a><br /><br />Support me via Patreon:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/danthecomposer">https://www.patreon.com/danthecomposer</a><br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:45 - First three chords<br />01:55 - Next two chords<br />03:14 - Next two chords<br />04:36 - Last two chords<br />05:44 - Last chord variation<br />06:24 - Ab as b6 chord<br />06:45 - Full review of piece<br />07:18 - Final words<br /><br />(You would do well to press the bell next to my Subscribe button and choose to be notified for all new uploads).<br /><br />danthecomposer Piano Challenge:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScTnOKnvtFY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScTnOKnvtFY</a><br /><br />Likes, comments and subscriptions always welcome!<br /><br />Follow me on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/danthecomposer/">https://www.instagram.com/danthecomposer/</a><br /><br />My Facebook Page on which you can discover all my work in one place and follow it easily:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/danthecomposer1">https://www.facebook.com/danthecomposer1</a><br /><br />My blog:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://piano-jazz.blogspot.com/">http://piano-jazz.blogspot.com/</a><br /><br />My compositions:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/danthecomposer">https://soundcloud.com/danthecomposer</a><br /><br />Ten Mins @ the Piano Playlist:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cPpP-Ua6NUFebhir7tx1CrW03zbb0d0">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cPpP-Ua6NUFebhir7tx1CrW03zbb0d0</a>{% endraw %}
