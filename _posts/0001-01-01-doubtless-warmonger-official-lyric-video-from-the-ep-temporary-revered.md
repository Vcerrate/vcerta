It is dangerous<br />We’ve given life to lifeless idols<br /><br />We’re self-obsessed<br />No one gives a care about the rest<br />You live and breathe this mess<br />Worship the conflict in your chest<br /><br />Would you march to the front of the line<br />If it was me on the other side?<br />All this has done is divide<br />Bow down, see where your loyalty lies<br /><br />Look me in the eyes<br />Is it me you despise?<br />Temporary revered as divine<br />It’s all a waste of time<br /><br />Broadbrusher<br />You come to damn us<br />Warmonger<br />You can’t repair us<br /><br />LOOK ME IN THE EYES<br />LOOK ME IN THE EYES<br />LOOK ME IN THE EYES{% endraw %}
