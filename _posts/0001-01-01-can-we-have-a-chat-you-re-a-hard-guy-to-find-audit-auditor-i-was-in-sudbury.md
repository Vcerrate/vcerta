{% raw %}I was in Sudbury today, and went to nestle, i was walking around for about ten mins without being approached, <br />i decided to let the security know i had been walking around unhindered, but he didnt like being told he was failing in his job..<br />then a &quot; karen&quot; came out to deal with me.<br />she didn't listen or want to listen, she phoned the police who turned up on blue lights and sirens but when they found me they couldn't of been nicer. <br /><br />The two officers are a credit to the police and more should take note of this interaction, and learn from it. great job you two ( if you're reading this ) <br /><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkY12Q0AfFlMskK9fqf7JoQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkY12Q0AfFlMskK9fqf7JoQ/join</a>{% endraw %}
