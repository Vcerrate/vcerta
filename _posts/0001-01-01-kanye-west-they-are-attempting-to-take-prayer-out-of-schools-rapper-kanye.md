{% raw %}Rapper Kanye West spoke at Joel Osteen‘s Lakewood Church in Houston. Osteen asked<br /><br />some leading questions and handed over the microphone. West said that God is speaking<br />through him, and suggested he wants forced prayer back in public school. He said, &quot;… The more and more this entire country follows Christ and sets the example that we are a Christian country — you know, they are attempting to take prayer out of schools. When you remove the fear and love of God, you create the fear and love of everything else… But let me break that down [not] in a negative way, but in a positive way. Reinstate the fear and love of God, and eliminate the fear and love of everything else.&quot;<br /><br />📧 Online platforms are fighting against content they find too sensitive by reducing post reach, strikes, removal of controversial posts...
