{% raw %}Whole blood CyTOF phospho flow stimulation and staining.<br /><br />Abbreviated video leaves out a lot of the staining and wash steps.<br /><br />Starts with aliquoting cytokines and other stimuli, then adding cytokines to blood (0:34), going into the incubator (1:02), fixing (1:17), lysing RBCs (1:37), washing (1:50), multiplexing through &quot;barcoding&quot; (2:20), rearranging tips at 2:38, combining cells together at 2:50, washing (3:03), ... and done!{% endraw %}
