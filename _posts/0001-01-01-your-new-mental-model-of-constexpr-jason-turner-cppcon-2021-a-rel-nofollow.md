I see people over-complicate constexpr by conflating it with meta programming and template-related topics. Students will often fail to recognize where and when constexpr could be used. Experts will get concerned about the &quot;contract&quot; you are making with the user of your library by marking functions as constexpr.<br /><br />In this talk, I will present a mental model for how you should consider constexpr. I will explain what constexpr is (less mechanically and more metaphorically), give practical applications for constexpr, and help you figure out where constexpr fits into your application or library.<br /><br />In the most straightforward sense, constexpr is moving work from runtime to compile-time. This mental model that I will present will ask, &quot;what work would you rather do at compile-time?&quot; We will find this answer by looking at constexpr as a continuum. On one end of the continuum is the use case of moving a runtime fixed-size vector into a compile-time fixed-size constexpr array, and on the far end is executing your entire program at compile-time and simply outputting the results at runtime.<br /><br />---<br />Jason Turner<br /><br />Host of C++Weekly <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JasonTurner-lefticus,">https://www.youtube.com/c/JasonTurner-lefticus,</a> Co-host of CppCast <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cppcast.com,">http://cppcast.com,</a> Co-creator and maintainer of the embedded scripting language for C++, ChaiScript <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://chaiscript.com,">http://chaiscript.com,</a> and author and curator of the forkable coding standards document <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cppbestpractices.com.">http://cppbestpractices.com.</a><br /><br />I'm available for contracting and onsite training. <br /><br />---<br />Videos Filmed &amp; Edited by Bash Films: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.BashFilms.com">http://www.BashFilms.com</a><br /><br />YouTube Channel Managed by Digital Medium Ltd <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://events.digital-medium.co.uk">https://events.digital-medium.co.uk</a><br /><br />The CppCon YouTube Channel Is Sponsored By:<br />JetBrains : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://jb.gg/cpptools">http://jb.gg/cpptools</a> <br />SonarSource:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sonarsource.com/">https://www.sonarsource.com/</a>{% endraw %}
