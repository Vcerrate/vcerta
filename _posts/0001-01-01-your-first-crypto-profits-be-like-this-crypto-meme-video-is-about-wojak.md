{% raw %}This Crypto meme video is about Wojak and his wager zoomer friends who try to become rich by trading crypto. Wojak actually makes a good move and manages to make a huge crypto profit overnight. He immediately becomes a role model for his friends and they start seeing him as a crypto guru and financial advisor. He gives them advice once, but it doesn't turn out too good..   <br /><br />Donations:<br />ðŸ”¸ Bitcoin/BTC: <br />bc1qc30sew8h6llkvwku8kdgh95mp7ym5xrv39gw3u<br /><br />ðŸ”¸ Ethereum/ETH: <br />0x7924D9A86042d6CFf721194e93D0a8F2BA89FCbe<br /><br />ðŸ”¸ Monero/XMR: <br />422WaV892QWVmGbRtvmV1P6THt1XZUCDB4Xd8erjfyAbL8Ey12cSvWRBpUF63Dfu9e6V2Yr8LBscnWtMAroHgMvTEdGdWfS<br /><br />ðŸ”¸ Cardano/ADA:<br />addr1q955z6jp6tg0560sv4dnypvsur98qktjds0p46d3qkmlx8tfg94yr5kslf5lqe2mxgzepcx2wpvhymq7rt5mzpdh7vwsuhjt8x<br /><br />Make sure to message me when you donate to me so I can thank you personally.
