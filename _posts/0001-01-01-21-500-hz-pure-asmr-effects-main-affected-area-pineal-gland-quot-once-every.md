{% raw %}&quot;Once every decade a soundtrack like this comes about, although not all human ears can hear up to 20,000 Hz the Pineal Gland is still susceptible to any heightened Hz and although you may not be able to notice the 21500 hertz with your ears - your pineal gland is aware of everything.&quot;<br /><br />What you are about to hear is truly exceptional in modern audiological standards, which in turn is proclaimed by some 'impossible to create'. However, with tireless efforts, we can finally present the game changer in modern meditation techniques. This audio track is made at an incredible 21500 hertz which surpasses any other and the aim; to activate the pineal gland for pure ASMR effects (which may also be attained during listening).<br /><br />Some may believe that one listen of this audio track is not enough - and in which case we would encourage those listeners to listen more than once, however despite studies being on-going - we are relying on feedback from our fans on this channel to collaborate sufficient data, so please leave your feedback in the comment section below: Please however allow 2-3 weeks for full effects of this audio track.<br /><br />#ASMR #21500hz #MeditationalState<br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCakcbmpdEhEYNcM0WBmYtJQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCakcbmpdEhEYNcM0WBmYtJQ/join</a><br /><br />Listen to this track as much or as little as you feel comfortable, either sitting or lying in a settled position.
