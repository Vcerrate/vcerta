{% raw %}Hello Friends, <br /><br />We have another bonus episode for y'all this week! <br /><br />On this episode we show you how we careened The Black Lotus, a 1965 Cheoy Lee Frisco Flyer, to replace a severely corroded seacock that failed and almost sunk the ship. <br />( <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Careening">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Careening</a> )<br /><br />You can see the video of that situation here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2-JwND0wAkM">https://youtu.be/2-JwND0wAkM</a><br /><br />The new owners of The Black Lotus are Kristen and Dyer and they have been hard at work restoring her and saving this beautiful boat. When the seacock failed we sat down and talked about what the options were. They are refitting the entire boat and on a limited  budget and when they haul out they want to do a complete bottom job and replace all the other seacocks and thruhulls at that time. <br /><br />I looked at the placement of the thruhulls and was certain I could get the boat to list over enough to expose them for a quick repair. <br /><br />We started buy attaching their Main Halyard to a dock cleat aft and their Jib Halyard to a dock cleat forward and then slowly took in line on the winches keeping the Halyards even and adjusting the dock lines when needed. Once we got the bungs almost out of the water we attached two heavy duty ratchet straps under the bow and cranked them taught. this lifted the bow and created a cradle to keep her stable in the slip in case of wakes. <br /><br />After that it was just time to get the job done. <br /><br />Thanks to Chris and Josh for the dockside assistance!<br /><br />You can follow along with Kristen and Dyer on Instagram to watch their progress as they save this beautiful boat : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sv_theblacklotus/">https://www.instagram.com/sv_theblacklotus/</a><br /><br />You can also subscribe to the Black Lotus Playlist where I will keep all videos related to this boat as they get uploaded: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm0chdAnUTpzh9zhvMZXgHMePxC99mvYg">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm0chdAnUTpzh9zhvMZXgHMePxC99mvYg</a> <br /><br />If you enjoy our channel please &quot;Like&quot; the videos and Subscribe so you don't miss any future episodes. <br /><br />If you find the videos helpful or entertaining and would like to contribute to the refit or Camille's beer fund you can become a Patron at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sailorjames">https://www.patreon.com/sailorjames</a> <br /><br />or if you would prefer to make a one time contribution you can send it via PAYPAL to jamesthesailorman@gmail.com<br /><br />Love,<br />James &amp; Camille<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sailorjames">https://www.patreon.com/sailorjames</a> <br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://svtriteia.com">http://svtriteia.com</a> <br /><br />Instagram: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/james.the.sailor.man">http://www.instagram.com/james.the.sailor.man</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/cum_eels">http://www.instagram.com/cum_eels</a>{% endraw %}
