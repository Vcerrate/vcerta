{% raw %}My rendition of the song &quot;Pulang&quot; from a favorite Indonesian band &quot;Float Project&quot;.  There is an official music video for the song, which I think is superb. But, I wanted to illustrate it with images of New Yorkers in motion at the end of the day. Heading home from their day of glistening and frenetic energy. The song is filled with melancholic longing to return, to reunite, and feelings of homesickness which I think is universal to New Yorkers and citizens of the world.<br /><br />PS.
