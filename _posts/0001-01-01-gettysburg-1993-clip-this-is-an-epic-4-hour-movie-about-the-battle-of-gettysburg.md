{% raw %}This is an epic 4 hour movie about the battle of Gettysburg, which was crucial in the American Civil War (aka the War of Northern Aggression).  It gives a bit of the flavor of how complex the military situation was and how unlike our modern concepts of warfare these battles were.  It has an excellent cast.{% endraw %}
