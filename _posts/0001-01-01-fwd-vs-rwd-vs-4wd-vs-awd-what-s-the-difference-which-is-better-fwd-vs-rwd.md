{% raw %}FWD vs RWD vs 4WD vs AWD | Drivetrain &amp; Powertrain Explained<br /><br />What is a drivetrain &amp; Powertrain?<br />Simply put, a drivetrain is the series of parts in your car that work together to make your wheels turn. A powertrain, on the other hand, is basically a drivetrain plus the engine and some other parts,<br /><br />Types of Drivetrains:<br />The four different types of drivetrains are <br />1) Front-Wheel Drive (FWD)<br />2) Rear Wheel Drive (RWD)<br />3) 4 Wheel Drive (4WD)<br />4) All Wheel Drive (AWD)<br /><br />1) Front-Wheel Drive (FWD):<br />Front-wheel drive refers to a car in which the transmission sends the engine’s power to the front wheels. Rear-wheel drive is the transmission that sends the engine’s power to the rear wheels. Four-and all-wheel drive cars have power at all four corners. <br /><br />If a vehicle features front-wheel drive, the transmission transfers power from the engine to the front wheels. The majority of cars today have a front-wheel-drive layout. This setup transfers power to the front wheels, giving them the responsibility of moving and steering the vehicle.<br /><br />2) Rear Wheel Drive (RWD):<br />Rear-wheel drive is basically the opposite of FRONT wheel drive. This drive is most commonly found on sports cars and performance sedans. Vehicles that feature rear-wheel drive are a bit more complicated. <br />Vehicles handle much better than front-wheel drive vehicles and you will notice the difference in curves, turns, and when navigating through traffic situations.  <br /><br />Traction won’t be as good, especially in wet or snowy road conditions. A rear-wheel-drive car of the same weight, power, gearing, and tire size and type will accelerate faster than a Frint wheel drive car, as the weight of the vehicle is transferred off the front wheels and onto the rear wheels to improve traction.  Front-wheel drive cars typically lose traction in these situations.<br /><br />3) 4 Wheel Drive (4WD):<br />Four-wheel drive, often abbreviated as 4WD, 4WD means the power from the engine is delivered to all 4 wheels all of the time when Four-by-Fours(4x4) is engaged, The 4WD vehicles are usually equipped with a transfer case which allows the car to change to RWD transmission in order to save fuel and get back to 4WD mode if and when required. <br /><br />4WD-equipped cars are called Four-by-Fours (4x4s) as the first digit here represents the number of wheels, and the second figure shows the total number of powered wheels. For example, trucks with 6×4 configurations have 6 wheels, out of which only 4 receive power. Most off-road-ready SUVs come with the 4WD system as they offer more traction.<br /><br />4) All Wheel Drive (AWD):<br />An all-wheel-drive arrangement works on pretty much the same principle as 4WD, but in most front-wheel drive or rear-wheel drive as the primary drive mode. The general misconception is that AWD and 4×4 are the same things. While both of them have all 4 wheels running, and they run on the same principles, there are some key differences that set the two apart. <br /><br />While most of the 4×4 send power to the rear wheels if and when required, the AWD cars are mostly FWD or RWD, depending upon the situation. This drive train employs a front, rear, and center differential to provide power to all four wheels of a vehicle. <br /><br />---- Time Stamp ---<br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:25 - What is Drivetrain &amp; Powertrain?<br />01:04 - Types of Drivetrains<br />01:49 - What is Front Wheel Drive (FWD)?<br />02:24 - How does FWD Works?<br />03:21 - Pros &amp; Cons of FWD<br />04:48 - What is Rear Wheel Drive (RWD)?<br />05:30 - How does RWD Works?<br />07:35 - Pros &amp; Cons of RWD<br />07:58 - What is 4 Wheel Drive (4WD)?<br />08:56 - How does 4WD Works?<br />11:25 - Should you buy a 4WD Vehicle?<br />12:05 - Pros &amp; Cons of 4WD<br />11:25 - What is All-Wheel Drive?<br />13:11 - How does AWD Works?<br />14:38 - Pros &amp; Cons of AWD<br />15:59 - Which is better?<br />16:53 - Wrap Up<br /><br />Video Credits:<br />The new 2015 BMW X6 M.
