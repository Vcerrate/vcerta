Inflammation is often hidden or silent, something that we can’t see or feel, but manifests itself as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, depression, and more. Typically, inflammation has been raging inside for a while before you even notice there’s anything wrong. The three biggest drivers of inflammation are all lifestyle factors—gut health, diet, and chronic stress.<br /><br />In this episode of my new Masterclass series, I am interviewed by my good friend and podcast host, Dhru Purohit, about inflammation, what’s causing it, and how to reduce it. We discuss the critical component of gut health and how 60-70% of our immune system is in our gut, as well as tests to identify inflammation in the body, foods to avoid, and the importance of restful sleep.<br /> <br />Dhru Purohit is a podcast host, serial entrepreneur, and investor in the health and wellness industry. His podcast, Dhru Purohit Podcast, is a top 50 global health podcast with over 30+ million unique downloads.
