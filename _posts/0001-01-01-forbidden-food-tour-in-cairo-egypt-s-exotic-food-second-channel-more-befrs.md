I’m from the US but I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. <br /> <br />If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture. <br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />🎬 CREDITS:<br />HOST » Sonny Side<br />DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY » Nguyễn Tân Khải<br />CAMERA OPERATOR » Nguyễn Minh Đức<br />VIDEO EDITOR » Tiep Tran<br />COLOR &amp; MASTER » Quí Nguyễn<br />LOCAL PRODUCER » Joe Samy with iEgypt Tours &amp; Travel (IG: @iegypte)<br />PRODUCER » Liz Peterson<br />PRODUCTION COORDINATOR » Huỳnh Hà My<br />PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS » Khoi Chung &amp; Huỳnh Nhi <br /><br />Selected tracks via Audio Network <br />For business inquiries: marketing@befrs.com{% endraw %}
