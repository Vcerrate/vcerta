{% raw %}Tableau LOD Level of Detail Expressions Explained   FIXED, INCLUDE, EXCLUDE   Complete Tutorial With<br /><br />hello friends welcome back to tech solutions please subscribe our channel and press the bell icon for upcoming videos thank you for all your support till now so in today's video we will see what is level of detail in tableau<br />or lod so level of detail expressions also known as lod it allows us to compute values at the data source level and the visualization level<br />lod expression gives us more control on the level of granularity we want to compute and depending on how we want to control the granularity there are different ways different types of lods so let's see these lods first<br />is include if you want to perform calculation at more granular level then is included so for example you have certain dimensions in your visualization and you want to add something additional level of dimensions or granularity and do the calculations and that calculations you want to show in your visualization<br />in that case we have to use include syntax is it has syntax a curly braces it's it should always be inside the curly braces include the word and the dimension if you have multiple dimensions just separate it by commas and colon then your calculation so in our case the syntax i have shown example i have shown here is include region and find the sum of profit in this case include region along with other dimensions your visualization and then find the sum of profit we will see all these with a proper practical example maybe in the later part of this video so this is about include exclude now if you want to perform calculations at less granular level then we have to use exclude<br />for example you have two dimensions in your visualization and you are finding some profit<br />but out of those two dimensions you want to exclude one of them and then find the sum of profit and show it show the sum of profit in your visualization in that case we have to use exclude lod syntax is same as include and instead of include keyword we have to use exclude keyword here now fixed fixed is the third lod type if you want to perform calculation at entirely independent level then use fixed independent level means you have certain dimensions in your visualizations but you don't want to use them you want to use something else and do your calculations so like for example i can tell we have customer and their department but you want to find the always find the sum at particular fixed level region level so the syntax of fixed is same as exclude and include just that we have to use fixed keyword now what is the difference between the first one include and the fixed include tells that include this particular dimension along with your existing dimensions into the visualizations and do the calculations whereas fixed is irrespective of what are all the dimensions you have into visualization<br />ignore them use this particular dimension which is mentioned in this calculation fixed and do the calculations and show the calculations this is the difference between fixed and include now let's see all these with a example with a practical example let's understand the data we are going to use for our examples so we have countrywise statewide citywise product wise profit and sales data so in this spreadsheet the granularity is product level granularity because that's the lowest level of record distinct record we can say for each city state and country<br />so let's start with the first we will create a map i just pulled city here i'm sorry i just pulled the state here and we have three different states arizona north dakota and new york and let's show the profit respective profit of them as a color let's show that as a label as well so we have uh 9000 for north dakota 5300 for arizona and 2800 for new york let's let's uh let's see the average of each of these<br />average profit<br />so we see we have average profit for these three different states we will we will check arizona i'll tell you why arizona because we have a data like that so arizona is showing us 1767 as average profit so let's right click and view data<br />full data here for arizona the profit is showing total three records divided by three because it is finding the average at the data source level three distinct records one two and three so it is two thousand one hundred plus one thousand one hundred plus two thousand one hundred divided by three comes to one thousand seven sixty now if you want to find the average at city level in this case see the cities are two distinct cities not three product is three city is just two for sedona there are two different products and if we include city and if you want to find city level in uh average of the profit the result will be different and that's the example we are going to use for include so now let's close this let's duplicate this map this will help us to compare later on right click and rename this sheet as include{% endraw %}
