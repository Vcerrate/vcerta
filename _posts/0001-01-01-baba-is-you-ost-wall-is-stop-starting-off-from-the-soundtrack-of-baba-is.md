{% raw %}From the soundtrack of Baba Is You.<br /><br />Baba Is You on Steam: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/">http://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/</a><br />Official website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.hempuli.com/baba/">http://www.hempuli.com/baba/</a><br /><br />I hadn't really done a &quot;remix&quot; before, so it was a lot of fun to compose a song that was meant to follow the tune and style of the main theme but with its own flair. I'm very happy with the result! Fairly simple but works for me.<br /><br />Baba Is You is a puzzle game where the rules you have to follow are present as blocks you can interact with. By manipulating them, you can change how the game works, repurpose things you find in the levels and cause surprising interactions!<br /><br />Composed by Arvi Teikari.{% endraw %}
