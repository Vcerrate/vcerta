{% raw %}Following yesterdayâ€™s meeting of home affairs ministers, Home Affairs Commissioner  Ylva Johansson announced that 15 EU member states have pledged to give protection to almost 40,000 Afghans. <br /><br />Johansson gave this as an example of how EU countries were moving away from irregular arrivals towards regular migration, allowing for more orderly migration management. This commitment is above existing pledges for resettlement. Johansson described it as an impressive act of solidarity. She pointed out that preventing irregular arrivals goes hand-in-hand with investing in legal entry.{% endraw %}
