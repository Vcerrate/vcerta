{% raw %}Israel is negotiating the supply of weapons and complexes &quot;Iron Dome&quot; to Ukraine.<br /><br />Israel is ready to provide its weapons to Ukraine, negotiations are underway.<br /><br />The command of the IDF  is negotiating the supply of its weapons to Ukraine. As the Israeli edition of The Times of Israel notes, in all likelihood, the Israeli side intends to abandon its earlier obligations to Moscow to provide Ukraine with only humanitarian aid, and now the Ukrainian side will be provided with various types of weapons.<br /><br />“Israel is among 40 countries that attended a meeting of Western countries to discuss supplying more weapons to Ukraine to help it counter Russian operations in the country. Israel's presence at Tuesday's US-sponsored meeting at Ramstein Air Base in Germany reflects an ongoing shift as Jerusalem appears to be abandoning its policy of only providing humanitarian aid to the stricken country just to keep ties with Moscow. Foreign Minister Yair Lapid even directly accused Russia of conducting a special operation, which was the sharpest comment against Moscow from a high-ranking Israeli official., - reports the Israeli edition of The Times of Israel.<br /><br />Remarkable is the fact that we can talk about small arms, anti-tank missile systems and, according to a number of sources, the Iron Dome air and missile defense systems (“Iron Dome”). The latter demonstrated a fairly high efficiency in intercepting various types of air targets, although it turned out to be very vulnerable to electronic warfare systems.<br /><br />Experts note that Israel is unlikely to provide Ukraine with a large batch of weapons, however, nevertheless, this already means that the Israeli is on Ukrainian side.{% endraw %}
