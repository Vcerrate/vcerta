{% raw %}This is a self-confidence affirmation track focused on relentless positivity and meant to correct any negative self-talk. The best way to overcome negativity is to overpower it with triumphant positivity, repeated enough that it becomes second nature. Listen often enough that these words and phrases repeat in your head.<br /><br />Recommended implementation: listen to these affirmations every day for at least 21 days (the time required to set a habitual mind pattern). Listen during the day or while drifting off to sleep. The Alpha-Theta border while falling asleep is the most receptive brainwave state for subconscious programming. LISTEN WITH HEADPHONES.<br /><br />====================<br /><br />More content on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/alphaaffirmations">https://www.patreon.com/alphaaffirmations</a><br /><br />Support the channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/affirmations">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/affirmations</a><br /><br />====================<br /><br />GO FORTH AND WIN GLORIOUS TRIUMPHS! <br /><br />Script in Closed Captions.<br /><br /> © STRICT COPYRIGHT WARNING<br />**All materials are copyrighted and may not be reproduced or repurposed without permission.**<br />© Jan 17, 2020{% endraw %}
