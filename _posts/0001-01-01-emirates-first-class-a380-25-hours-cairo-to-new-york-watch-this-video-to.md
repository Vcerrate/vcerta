{% raw %}Watch this video to see what’s it like to fly on the world’s biggest commercial jet in FIRST CLASS with Emirates?!<br /><br />Nobody has done more with the Airbus A380 Super Jumbo than Emirates, especially in “Emirates First Class.” <br /><br />But does it still live up to the hype? We spent 25 hours traveling halfway around the planet putting Emirates First Class to the test on the A380.<br /><br />In this video, you’ll join us for two incredible Emirates First Class A380 flights, a visit to the Emirates First Class Lounge, and one of the most magnificent aviation experiences available today.<br /><br />You’ll see the Emirates First Class A380 seats, which are really more like private cocoons. We’ll highlight all of the details and give you a sense for what it’s like to sit, sleep, and eat in them.<br /><br />You’ll see a grand total of seven meals from our Emirates First Class A380 journey from Cairo to Dubai and onto New York’s JFK International Airport.<br /><br />You’ll see the Emirates First Class A380 inflight entertainment, which is among the best in the world.<br /><br />You’ll see the Emirates First Class A380 service we experienced. In a bit of a spoiler alert, I’ll say the Emirates First Class cabin crew were always there when we wanted something, but they didn’t hover unnecessarily. Put another way, it was true Emirates First Class Service!<br /><br />You’ll even go inside not one, but two Emirates Lounges. The Emirates Lounge in Cairo and the mind-blowing Emirates First Class Lounge in Dubai.<br /><br />Emirates 777-300 New First Class:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsswlMIo4vY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsswlMIo4vY</a><br /><br />0:00 Introduction<br />1:28 Boarding Emirates First Class A380 to Cairo<br />5:31 Emirates First Class Lounge<br />8:50 Boarding Emirates First Class A380 to New York City<br />11:05 Emirates First Class A380 Seat Tour<br />13:59 Getting Comfortable on Emirates A380<br />15:37 Emirates A380 Bar<br />17:58 Emirates First Class Shower Spa<br />18:43 Emirates First Class A380 JebScore<br /><br />For more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.JebBrooksFlies.com">http://www.JebBrooksFlies.com</a> <br /><br />Check me out on Instagram: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies">https://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies</a> <br /><br />Check me out on Twitter, too: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/jebbrooks">https://twitter.com/jebbrooks</a> <br /><br />And don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://greenergrass.com/">https://greenergrass.com/</a> <br /><br />Music:<br />The Northern Saga – Luwaks<br />Sabah – Ali Sabah<br />Low Res Goddess – Young Community<br />Together at Dawn – Joseph Alesci<br />Our Youth is Running Out – Alec Slayne<br />In the Beginning of Time – Of Water<br />Restless (Instrumental Version) – Kadant<br />Indulgent (Uygar Duzgun)<br />Lighthearted Daydream – Dez Moran<br />Draw Lines in the Sand (Instrumental Version) – Blood Red Sun<br />A New Decade Begins – Of Water<br />Better (Not Bitter) (Instrumental Version) – King Sis<br />You Me (Instrumental Version) – Penny Lane<br />Core Memory – Colors of Illusion<br />End Destination (Instrumental Version) – Lvly{% endraw %}
