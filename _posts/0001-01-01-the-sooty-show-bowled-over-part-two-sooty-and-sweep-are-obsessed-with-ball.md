{% raw %}Sooty and Sweep are obsessed with ball games. Soo thinks it silly and dangerous to play ball games in the house so she goes to tell Matthew, not only to find that Matthew is playing with balls aswell. He rethinks and agrees with Soo. He takes all of the balls from Sooty, Sweep and Soo, to stop ball games indoors. Sooty asks what's a bowling ball and as per usual Matthew boasts about being a super bowler. Sooty magic's them to a place to play his favourite ball game first which is Billiards, and then to a Bowling Alley. One thing that surprises them is that Matthew is really good at bowling, but then they decide to take Matthew down a peg or two.{% endraw %}
