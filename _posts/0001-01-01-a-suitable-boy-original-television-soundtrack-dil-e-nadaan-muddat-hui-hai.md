{% raw %}A Suitable Boy (Original Television Soundtrack)<br />Mira Nair's A Suitable Boy, BBC Studios' first-ever series with no major European characters, does not miss a beat in funneling a massive novel into an intricately stitched, necessarily pared filmed version. This panoramic portrait of a newly-free nation and fast-changing social segments within it has an easy-flowing quality that belies the sheer magnitude of the exercise.<br /><br />A Suitable Boy is a drama TV series from BBC and is premiered on 26 July 2020. The show will come with a collection of tracks from world-class artists. You can check out and listen to the complete list of credited songs below:<br />-Dil-E-Nadaan<br />-Muddat Hui Hai<br />-Mehfil Barkhaast Hui<br />-Lutf Woh Ishq Mein<br />-Na-Rawa Kahiye<br />Listen to the playlist of all of the songs played in the tv show by Kavita Seth.<br /><br />#ASuitableBoy #Soundtracks #Dil_E_Nadaan #MuddatHuiHai #MehfilBarkhaastHui #LutfWohIshqMein #NaRawaKahiye #TheAntsStudio{% endraw %}
