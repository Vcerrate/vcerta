It's a village, not a club, and we plan to be here a while: like, till the end of the world. So calm down: remember that rest is from God: and thank him for Saturday mornings on which there is no better thing to do than ponder life in his universe and... chill.<br /><br />This week, the Mad Christian and Meridith speak about:  <br /><br />Extra-terrestrials, UFOs and demons<br />My family uses eisegesis against me<br />Is unconsummated marriage still a marriage?<br />I messed up a moment to tell someone about my faith<br />Marian visions and Lutherans praying rosaries<br />Where do the saints who die do, while we wait for Judgement day?<br /><br />The opinions expressed on the Stop the White Noise are those of RevFisk and Meridith, but sometimes also God. Studies show that learning to tell the difference greatly enhances your viewing experience. <br /><br />If you need help, the Holy Bible stands ready to assist you, as (hopefully) does your local, trustworthy pastor.<br /><br />To join our Discord community online, request an invitation link through <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://revfisk.com/contact/">https://revfisk.com/contact/</a><br /><br />Find everything else at revfisk.com <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://revfisk.com/">https://revfisk.com/</a>{% endraw %}
