{% raw %}Performing the song &quot;When We Were Free&quot; at The Boot &amp; Saddle, February 6th, 2015.<br />Meddlesome Meddlesome Meddlesome Bells have been labeled by the Philadelphia City Paper as “the most criminally underrated band in Philly”. Since the band’s debut in 2008, they have been self-releasing their rock-tumult with heaviness and abandon. Their third full-length, released in 2015 through their own Bells Recording Co., is available on limited pink vinyl and download at www.somebells.com.<br /><br />Shot by:<br />Scott Colan, Wright Seneres<br /><br />Sound By: Jamie Olson<br /><br />Follow us on Facebook <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://Facebook.com/scrappletv">http://Facebook.com/scrappletv</a><br /><br />Follow us on Twitter<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/ScrappleTV">http://twitter.com/ScrappleTV</a><br /><br />Stop by the Website for More News and Infotainment <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://scrapple.tv/">http://scrapple.tv/</a>{% endraw %}
