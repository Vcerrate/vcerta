{% raw %}12th song of the SEASON!!!! 40 more songs to go, 40 more weeks to go. OK SO, this song is very very different from any song I have ever done. I wanted to make a song that is mostly falsetto vocals, which I have never done before, so this was pretty scary to do. This is totally one of those songs where I have ZERO idea if you guys are gonna love it or hate it LOL, but what is making art without that risk? ANYWAY, &quot;Sorry to Bother You&quot; is about waiting too long to say something that matters to you. One example is not telling someone how you feel, and letting them slip away. Another is not standing up for yourself either at a job or social situation, letting life pass you like a passerby. Basically it's not saying how you feel when you should. Sometimes this is out of wanting to be polite, or respectful, and to not want to be a burden to anyone. I thought the phrase &quot;Sorry to Bother You&quot; was interesting b/c it is scene as like a polite thing to say, at least here in the West. Maybe sometimes it's ok to bother, to speak your mind as long as it's not negatively harming anyone. SO, hope you enjoy the song, and please have a wonderful day/night/afternoon wherever you are in the world :) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fanlink.to/stby">https://fanlink.to/stby</a><br /><br />Buy Merch here :) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unlikepluto.merchtable.com/">https://unlikepluto.merchtable.com/</a><br />ðŸ–¤Join my Discord community! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/up">https://discord.gg/up</a><br />ðŸŽ§<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fanlink.to/unlikepluto">https://fanlink.to/unlikepluto</a><br /><br />LYRICS:<br />Sorry to, sorry to bother<br />You, why do I wait till it's all crashing through<br />Why do I make this self fulfilling doom<br />Why don't I ever see it coming, way ahead<br />Cuz it's obvious<br /><br />Was it something I said<br />Was it all in my head<br />Now I wish that I said<br />Sorry to bother you<br /><br />Locking it up and throw away the key<br />Any faint chance I had of asking<br />You<br />Never can ask of<br />You<br /><br />Was it something I said<br />Was it all in my head<br />Now I wish that I said<br />Sorry to bother you<br /><br />Was it something I said<br />Was it  all in my head<br />Now I wish that I said<br />Sorry to bother you<br /><br />Sorry to bother you{% endraw %}
