{% raw %}* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *<br />Maricopa, Arizona — The Maricopa Police Department released body camera footage and parts of 911 calls related to the investigation of an officer-involved shooting of a Homestead resident in March. Lawrence Knudsen, 56, called 911 on March 27 and told the dispatcher he was suicidal. During the phone call, Knudsen indicated he had a gun but told the dispatcher he wasn't looking to hurt any police officers. After the officers arrived, Knudsen can be heard saying &quot;Let's do this&quot; repeatedly and began to walk toward the officers. An officer instructs Knudsen to back up and he doesn't comply. <br /><br />An officer the department identified as “Officer Nye” deploys a stun gun on Knudsen while another officer named “Officer Nylander” shoots him multiple times. Police said Nylander did not have her body camera activated during the shooting but did not specify why. Body-camera footage from Nye and an “Officer McCorry” shows Knudsen collapsing almost immediately after being shot and stunned. Officers later found Knudsen was holding a vape pen in his right hand. Officers performed life-saving measures on Knudsen before he was taken to a hospital where he later died.<br /><br />Donate to PoliceActivity: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity">https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity</a><br />Like us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PoliceActivity">https://www.facebook.com/PoliceActivity</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Police_Activity">https://twitter.com/Police_Activity</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />0:00 - 911 Call<br />4:56 - Bodycam: Officer Nye<br />5:34 - Bodycam: Officer McCorry{% endraw %}
