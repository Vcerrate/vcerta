{% raw %}Without being fluent in Spanish, getting a haircut in Mexico for the first time was, well... OMG!<br />►Get perks on PATREON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/tangerinetravels">https://www.patreon.com/tangerinetravels</a><br /><br />On today's Guadalajara vlog, we are both getting our hair cut. Jordan goes to a barbershop in Mexico and Maddie attempts to find a hair salon in Guadalajara. It wasn't quite as easy as we thought. <br /><br />Getting a haircut can be a terrifying experience in general but when you don't speak the language very well...that's when things get really scary! Maddie's first haircut in Mexico with mediocre Spanish skills, this should be fun!<br /><br />Make sure to watch the full video if you want to see the hilarious and embarrassing trainwreck when Maddie finally goes to get her first haircut ever in Mexico!<br /><br />ABOUT US (MADDIE &amp; JORDAN)<br />In January 2018, we sold everything we owned in the US (except our husky Laska &amp; what fit in our tiny, tangerine Prius C3) to travel the world—starting with Mexico. Since then, we've been making travel videos about our life in Mexico and the new experiences we encounter while traveling the world.
