{% raw %}We have all bitten off more than we can chew, but never quite as much as this female jaguar! She managed to catch an enormous amain, but had some real difficulty getting it out of the river.<br />Jaguars will typically drag their catch away from the river to feed, but what if it is too big? This jaguar tried moving the caiman several times in several places, and eventually got it right, but after some serious effort. On the plus side, she did not have to hunt again for a week with so much food.<br />Thanks to Abbie Martin from the Jaguar ID Project (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jaguaridproject.com)">https://www.jaguaridproject.com)</a> for this amazing footage, and well done on yet another fantastic sighting!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.fivezerosafaris.com/safari/jaguar-safari-brazil/">http://www.fivezerosafaris.com/safari/jaguar-safari-brazil/</a><br />www.fivezerosafaris.com{% endraw %}
