Justification can be explained through the theory of strategic culture.<br /><br />Strategic culture refers to the prevailing views in a particular state about the nature of the war and crisis, the threat to the country and the causes of the threat, and the operational options to respond to that threat. Russia's strategic culture is particularly influenced by history, but also by geography, technology and, for example, the political culture and attitudes of the state.<br /><br />Synthesized English audio on this video is based on the subtitles of the original video.
