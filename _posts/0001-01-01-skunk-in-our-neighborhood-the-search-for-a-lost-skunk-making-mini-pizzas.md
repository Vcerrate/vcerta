{% raw %}and a new port-a-potty at pirate island!<br /><br />JOIN OUR FAM!! --- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/rfgp8V">http://goo.gl/rfgp8V</a><br /><br />Best Skunk Day Ever 1165<br /><br />Guys!! we are looking for a skunk! A few of our neighbors have seen a skunk running around, climbing under fences and running through back yards. So we decide that we are going to try and find it. We bundle the kiddos up and put baby Navey in her stroller, we begin walking around our neighborhood. Along the way, we find some rocks, Niko gets really excited when he finds a pumpkin, and at one point its possible that we are being chased by a skeleton!! (lol i love pretend play with the kiddos)<br /><br />We don't end up seeing the skunk, but when we get home we do find that some packages have arrived for us. We unbox the biggest one, and it turns out to be one of the coolest surprises ever. It's our brand new Spacestation Gaming controller!! For the very first time, you can get a xbox or playstation controller that is SSG themed. I love it!! It also came with a skateboard, so we take it into the house so Adley and Niko can do skatepark tricks in the living room!!<br /><br />For our Lunch time routine, we decide to have some family fun and everyone make their very own mini pizza!! Both Adley and Niko Bear do amazing for their first time making them, and without even trying Adley makes an exact copy of Jenny's pizza! While those are cooking in the over, we take one more peak outside to see if we by chance can find the skunk.<br /><br /> After lunch, we all jump in Jenny's purple tesla and head to pirate island. We got a port-a-potty!! Winter is coming so we needed a bathroom at the lake. We also need to look for our missing paddle board. There was just a huge wind storm and it blew away!! We want to make sure everything else at the lake is ok.<br /><br />Back home, it's almost time for bed, so the last game the kiddos want to play before its time to start our night routine is floor is lava. We set up a great obstacle course in the kitchen and the kiddos go back and worth, doing amazing at this fun game!!<br /><br />\\\\<br />Watch Adley's last video: COOKING with Barbie!!
