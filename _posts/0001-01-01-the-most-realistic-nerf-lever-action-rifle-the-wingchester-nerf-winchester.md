Lever action NERF: the cowboy fantasy that's a rare site for... some reason in the hobby. Yes we have the NERF Zombie Strike Slingfire, Roblox BEES! Blasters, and of course the BuzzBee Air Warriors Sentinel; but none of those function with a, &quot;King's Gate&quot; like a more powerful realistic Levergun would use which gives it a niche but tactical advantage. Gdop from Shellington Blasters has taken everything learned from the Spring Thunder and Flypoint blasters, and built this: the Wingchester, the side-loading gated NERF Levergun of my dreams. This specific one was printed out and built by Valour, who put a bunch of extra time and effort into making a far more high resolution and smoother blaster. Shell fed, tube magazine, and shell ejecting: it doesn't get any better.<br /><br />Purchase Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shellingtonblasters.com/product-page/copy-of-assembled-levergun-open-beta-2">https://www.shellingtonblasters.com/product-page/copy-of-assembled-levergun-open-beta-2</a><br />Valour's Blasters: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ValoursBlasters/videos">https://www.youtube.com/c/ValoursBlasters/videos</a><br />and Heath Heil added a ton to this blaster and I was a jerk that didn't mention it, so please give him a visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HeathHeil">https://www.youtube.com/c/HeathHeil</a><br /><br /><br />Buying NERF Blasters or Mod Materials?
