{% raw %}If you watched Part 1 of my History of Religion series, you learned what paganism was.  It’s the polytheistic belief of father god, mother god, and son of god.  You learned where it started and where it spread.  You may have understood more why people believe Christianity was stolen from Egyptian beliefs or you may still even believe that lie because you still haven’t been exposed enough to the truth about it all.  We can’t get too deep into the truth about Christianity without getting to know and understand the children of Israel.  <br /><br />This video will break down the beginning history of the Hebrews.  You'll understand about their covenant, the 10 commandments, and the Law they received from the Lord.   You need to understand them to understand the history of religion and the truth about Christianity.  <br /><br />The main source of this is the Bible.  The book of Genesis to the book of Numbers{% endraw %}
