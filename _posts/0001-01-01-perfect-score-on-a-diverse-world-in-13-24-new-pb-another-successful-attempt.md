{% raw %}Another successful attempt at slicing some time off my personal record which stood at 17:31 (achieved last week) This was a great seed and a great, well practised player could have got an insane time on this game. I'll keep going at this and aim for sub 10 minutes, and who knows, in the process maybe I'll even knock Geography challenges off the 5th spot of the geotips leaderboard with a sub 7:16.{% endraw %}
