{% raw %}Did you know that fillers can actually make you look older? We talk a lot about aging here, and one-way people often combat aging is by using fillers. But WAIT. Before you look to fillers to help correct your aging problems, you need to hear why fillers can actually make you look older, and the unflattering results may be more permanent than you think.<br /><br />Oftentimes, people go and get fillers in the same place over and over again: the outer cheeks, jawline, chin, etc. Over time, you begin to see an outwardly protruding cheekbone and overly full lower face. Your face will look more square, which makes the eye see an accelerating aging process- in short, you’ll look even older than you are. <br /><br />WATCH MORE FROM DR.
