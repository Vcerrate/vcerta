No one comes to the Father except through me.<br /><br />Jesus Christ<br /><br />Do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Let the day's own trouble be sufficient for the day.<br /><br />Jesus Christ<br /><br />For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his soul?<br /><br />Jesus Christ<br /><br />So I say to you, Ask and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you.<br /><br />Jesus Christ<br /><br />A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.<br /><br />Jesus Christ{% endraw %}
