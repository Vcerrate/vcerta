Check out this simple dividend portfolio for cash flow! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/V3kXlKUMlkM">https://youtu.be/V3kXlKUMlkM</a> <br /><br />In this video, Iâ€™ll share seven passive income ideas, four of which nobody is even talking about and three that I use to make thousands a month. Iâ€™ll reveal how to get started in each, how much you can expect to make and how to make money with as little work as possible! <br /><br />Step-by-Step to My First Passive Income Stream with Self-Publishing <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ieDTaSUP9SY">https://youtu.be/ieDTaSUP9SY</a><br /><br />Need Cash NOW and canâ€™t wait?

Nation, you see way too many videos here on YouTube promising you easy money or completely passive income with no investment or time, promises of making thousands even tens of thousands a week â€¦and itâ€™s all a scam!<br /><br />I know the idea of passive income, money you make with no work, is the goal but letâ€™s be honestâ€¦anything you do to make money is going to take one of three things.<br /><br />Itâ€™s either a business you put in the time and work to set up, that runs itself afterwards. You invest in a business thatâ€™s already set up and can run itself. Or itâ€™s a business you get started and need to spend very little time keeping the cash flow going on your schedule. <br /><br />Now the last three passive income ideas Iâ€™ll be sharing are of that first kind, where you spend just a little time to get them started and theyâ€™ll run themselves as completely passive cash flow. And I understand thatâ€™s what most people want when they think â€˜passive incomeâ€™ but the real opportunity is in a combination of those other two types; starting a business that is going to help you make money on your schedule whenever you want. Do not avoid some of these passive income ideas just because they require a little work to get started. They WILL change your life!<br /><br />0:00 Best Passive Income Ideas 2022<br />1:22 Best Online Passive Income Idea<br />2:40 Passive Income with Online Mastermind Groups<br />3:54 Is Passive Income Really Passive?<br />4:22 3 Types of Passive Income<br />5:58 How to Create Passive Income with Etsy or Shopify<br />8:29 A Passive Income Idea that Made Me $4000<br />10:18 Why Passive Income Investing Doesn't Count<br />11:56 My First Passive Income Stream<br />14:31 I Make $10,000+ a Month with This Passive Income Idea<br /><br />ðŸ¤‘  Get The Weekly Bow-Tie - my FREE weekly email newsletter sharing market updates, trends and the most important news!
