{% raw %}It has always bothered me tremendously that the Internet did not have a high-quality version of this very important 3.5s clip from The Importance of Being Earnest (1952).  <br /><br />I have made every effort to preserve as much quality as I possibly can in this video of great cultural significance, while reducing somewhat the great deal of white noise and rumble present in the original audio recording to bring you A HANDBAAAAAAG??!{% endraw %}
