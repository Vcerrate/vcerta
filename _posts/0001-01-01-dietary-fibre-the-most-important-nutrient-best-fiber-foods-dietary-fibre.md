{% raw %}Dietary fibre refers to the indigestible fibrous materials in our diets.<br /><br />Role of Dietary Fibre in our Diets<br /><br />Dietary fibre refers to the indigestible fibrous materials in our diets. A good example of this<br />is the cellulose that is present in plants. These fibrous materials are important because it<br />provides bulk to the intestinal contents and helps peristalsis.<br /><br />Peristalsis is a series of wavelike, muscular movements of the walls of the digestive tract.<br />Such movements enable food to be mixed with the digestive juices and at the same time<br />move along the digestive canal. This seems like a smooth process, so you may wonder how<br />constipation occurs?<br /><br />Constipation can occur if proper peristaltic movements do not occur, the undigested matter in<br />the large intestine cannot be moved along fast enough and too much water will be absorbed.<br />As a result the faeces becomes dry and hard and their removal through excretion becomes<br />difficult. This condition is called constipation. This can be prevented by taking enough fibre<br />and consuming sufficient water. Fresh fruits and vegetables, bran, cereals, whole wheat<br />flatbread and breads are good sources of fibres.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Support our channel and also get access to awesome perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbaZa-dV7h9QOLzrzrY363w/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbaZa-dV7h9QOLzrzrY363w/join</a><br /><br />Help us making Education Universal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.Launchgood.com/educationforeverychild">https://www.Launchgood.com/educationforeverychild</a><br /><br />Support us on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/freeanimatedEducation">https://www.patreon.com/freeanimatedEducation</a><br /><br />ðŸš¨ OTHER LINKS:<br /><br />Follow our Social Media:<br /><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/FreeAnimatedEducation">https://www.youtube.com/c/FreeAnimatedEducation</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/freeAnimatedEducationâ€‹">https://www.facebook.com/freeAnimatedEducationâ€‹</a><br /><br />#FreeAnimatedEducation #DietaryFibre #FiberFoods{% endraw %}
