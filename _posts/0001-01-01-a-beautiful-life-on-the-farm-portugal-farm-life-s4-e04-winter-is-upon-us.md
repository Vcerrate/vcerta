{% raw %}Winter is upon us and its the coldest month of the year here in Portugal. during the days we have had lots of glorious sunshine and blue skies but at night the temperatures have dropped as low as -1 Celsius.<br /><br />In this episode we have a look at what our neighbour is up to on his farm and I film a bunch of beautiful scenery to show you the sights and sounds from our farm in Central Portugal.<br /><br />We also pop into our local vets in Castelo Branco called Vet Beirao so that our young puppy Edmundo can get his second vaccination and his microchip.<br /><br />We hope you enjoy the episode. Thanks for watching. See you all again next week ❤<br /><br />We are Ken &amp; Gina and we left the UK in 2019 in search of a simpler life away from our office jobs and the hustle and bustle of the big city. We sold our house, left the UK and left the Rat race behind us to move to Portugal and buy a farm. We found an amazing farm in Castelo Branco Central Portugal where we have lived for the last two and a half years.<br /><br />JOIN US ON PATREON (EARLY RELEASE VIDEOS AND MORE)<br />↠ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/okportugal">https://www.patreon.com/okportugal</a><br /><br />OKPORTUGAL SHOP:<br />↠ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/OKportugal">https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/OKportugal</a><br /><br />FOLLOW US:<br />↠ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ok.portugal">https://www.instagram.com/ok.portugal</a><br />↠ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/okportugalfarm">https://www.facebook.com/okportugalfarm</a><br />↠ Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thirdbeeontheleft.com">https://www.thirdbeeontheleft.com</a><br />↠ Email Us: okportugal@hotmail.com<br /><br />CHECK OUT OUR AMAZON STORE:<br />↠ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/shop/okportugal">https://www.amazon.co.uk/shop/okportugal</a><br /><br /><br />Catch up on all the seasons and episodes by heading over to our playlists here:<br />↠ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/OKportugal/playlists">https://www.youtube.com/c/OKportugal/playlists</a><br /><br />*We use affiliate links and earn a small percentage from qualifying purchases at no extra cost to you.<br /><br />#PORTUGAL #CASTELOBRANCO #FARMLIFE{% endraw %}
