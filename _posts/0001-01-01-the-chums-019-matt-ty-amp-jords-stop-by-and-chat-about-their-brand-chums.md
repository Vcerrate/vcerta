{% raw %}Matt, Ty &amp; Jords stop by and chat about their brand, CHUMS. What once started with a small group of trouble makers who gained the name &quot;The Chums&quot; from parents of the community, has now developed into a crew of 40+ members and one of New Zealand's young iconic outdoor brands. These legends are well known for their fun and extreme adventures in fishing, hunting, snowboarding, 4x4 and more. We chat all things CHUMS and metal health. <br /><br />If you would like to support Chums, you can check out there links below:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.chums.online/">https://www.chums.online/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/chums.nz/">https://www.instagram.com/chums.nz/</a>{% endraw %}
