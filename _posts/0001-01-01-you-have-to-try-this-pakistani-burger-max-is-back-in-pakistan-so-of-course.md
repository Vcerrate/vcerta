{% raw %}ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° Max is back in Pakistan, so of course I had to bring him back to visit our Pakistani brother, Hashim Amla. But I didn't realize now they had a burger shop! And more than that, the burger shop was named after our friend Pazaldin, &quot;Shining Wala Burger Shop&quot;! So of course Max and I, despite being full beyond belief, had to give it a try. Hope you enjoy.<br />Il------------------------------------------<br />Updates from the road:<br />â–º Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/chrismixlewis/">https://www.instagram.com/chrismixlewis/</a><br />â–º Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/chrismixxlewis">https://www.facebook.com/chrismixxlewis</a><br />------------------------------------------<br />#Pakistan #Burgers{% endraw %}
