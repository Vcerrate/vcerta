{% raw %}Today we have returned with a Roblox in a nutshell styled video based on the ever so infamous topic, Roblox online daters (otherwise known as ODers) Roblox online daters are essentially a type of player on Roblox that does a little bit of tom foolery... but in a bad way according to my opinion. These players quite literally, date online in Roblox. Yes, shocking. Who would've guessed? They can be found in a variety of games from role play games to even certain fighting games or event games like Murder Mystery 2. However, Roblox Online Daters are definitely more prevalent in the roleplay/club/Meep City styled games. So, I will be using some stupid jokes in order to make a funny moments/funny compilation &quot;in a nutshell&quot; meme styled video.<br /><br />A lot of these players can get really wild. They will do everything that pushes the Roblox censorship guidelines, and it's actually quite interesting to see how they manage to push the line of censorship on Roblox. It's a complete cesspool yet for some reason it was still pretty interesting to &quot;research&quot;.<br /><br />Yes, in this video I will be covering ALL the information you need to know in a Roblox Online Dater in a nutshell condensed video.<br /><br />I hope you all liked this Roblox video!
