{% raw %}God says although this MIGHT put you in Trouble ðŸ‘‰but you should know this #181<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />PRAYER REQUESTS:<br /><br />INSTAGRAM: ishmael_n_ <br />E-MAIL: Intlhamu@outlook.com <br /><br /><br />IF YOU FEEL BLESSED BY THE WORD AND FEEL LED TO GIVE/DONATE TO THIS MINISTRY CHECK THE DETAILS BELOW:<br /><br />AND REMEMBER THAT THE GOSPEL IS FREE AND IS NOT A MUST TO DONATE. ONLY TO DO SO IF YOU FEEL FREE ABOUT IT. GOD WILL SURELY BLESS YOU.<br /><br />If we have sown [the good seed of] spiritual things in you, is it too much if we reap material things from you? If others share in this rightful claim over you, do not we even more? However, we did not exercise this right, but we put up with everything so that we will not hinder [the spread of] the good news of Christ. Do you not know that those who officiate in the sacred services of the temple eat from the temple [offerings of meat and bread] and those who regularly attend the altar have their share from the [offerings brought to the] altar? So also [on the same principle] the Lord directed those who preach the gospel to get their living from the gospel.<br />[1 Corinthians 9:11â€­-â€¬14 AMP]<br /><br /><br />Hence, I also say, you can Donate to this Ministry with any amount you feel led to give/donate: <br /><br />PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/INtlhamu">https://www.paypal.me/INtlhamu</a><br /><br /><br />NB: Please Let me know in my Email or DM after you've given so I can pray for you/with you further.<br /><br /><br />REMEMBER THAT THE GOSPEL IS FREE AND IS NOT A MUST TO DONATE.
