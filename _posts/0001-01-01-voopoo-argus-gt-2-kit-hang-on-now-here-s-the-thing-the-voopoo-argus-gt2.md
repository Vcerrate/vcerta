{% raw %}Here's the thing, the VooPoo Argus GT2 mod is pretty bang on.  I worry about the door sometimes, but honestly overall in my day to day use ( without whacking it with a piece of wood ) it feels quite secure.   The hand feel is baller and the weight is kinda just right.  In my opinion it's not quite as cool as the OG VooPoo Argus GT.  <br /><br />I'll pass on this MAAT tank if i'm being really truthful.  The airflow isn't really my favorite, it gets a little sharp and sometimes choppy.  Both the TPP-DM2 and TPP-DM3 coil heads rip pretty hard.  The DM2 ( 0.2ohm ) does not need much wattage at all to really rip hard.  Dig these coil heads the slurp I spoke about I believe as user error while I was filling it.  It went away and never came back. <br /><br />Boosh vape science 9,000<br /><br />Smokers accidently quit with vaping<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22855522/vaping-smokers-plans-quit-cigarettes">https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22855522/vaping-smokers-plans-quit-cigarettes</a><br />Nicotine, Carcinogen, and Toxin Exposure in Long-Term E-Cigarette and Nicotine Replacement Therapy Users<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M16-1107">https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M16-1107</a><br />Beneficial effects of nicotine<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1859921/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1859921/</a><br />A Randomized Trial of E-Cigarettes versus Nicotine-Replacement Therapy<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1808779">https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1808779</a><br />Cardiovascular Effects of Switching From Tobacco Cigarettes to Electronic Cigarettes<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2019.09.067">https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2019.09.067</a> <br /><br />UNPAID SPONSOR:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://grimmgreenmerch.com/">https://grimmgreenmerch.com/</a><br />High quality, independant merch shipped by me, our selection sucks but i'm trying to fix it. <br />PAID SPONSOR:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thecoldestwater.com/?ref=grimmgreen">https://thecoldestwater.com/?ref=grimmgreen</a><br />The Coldest Water - Use code &quot;GRIMM&quot; for 10% off<br />UNPAID SPONSOR:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.palmerspowders.com/">https://www.palmerspowders.com/</a><br />High quality and precise powder coating from one of the best around <br />GRIMM'S GREENS<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://grimmgreen.com/extrax/">https://grimmgreen.com/extrax/</a><br /><br /><br />THIS VIDEO IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY!
