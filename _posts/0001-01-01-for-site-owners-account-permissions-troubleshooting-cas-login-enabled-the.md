{% raw %}The most common reason a user isn't able to log in to their site is that their account wasn't set up to enable a CAS login.  This video walks through how to confirm that the user is an admin, check to see if CAS is enabled, and then configure the account for CAS login.<br /><br />Troubleshooting steps:<br /><br />When working with users and permissions, double-check that the user doesn't already have a profile, or inadvertently has two profiles.  <br /><br />-Users should be CAS enabled<br />-User Name should be First and Last name<br />-Upon initial set up, add any random password.  This password will never be used as if the user is -CAS enabled, that password will be used by the system. <br />-Only select one role - two roles will negate the higher-level permission.  For example, some marked as a content editor and a site owner will only have content editor permissions{% endraw %}
