{% raw %}This brief video covers the core technique of how I do almost all probability questions and shows the two most common mistakes I have seen students make over almost a decade of tutoring. <br /><br />Here are three different examples or probability questions that might appear on the GRE or GMAT.<br />There are 3 red beads and 5 green beads in a bag. If two beads are picked at random and without replacement from the bag, what is the probability that both beads are green?<br />You need to know the letter technique.<br /><br />There are 3 red beads and 5 green beads in a bag. If two beads are picked at random and without replacement from the bag, what is the probability that both beads are the same colour?<br />The difference between AND and OR in probability.<br /><br />There are 3 red beads and 5 green beads in a bag. If two beads are picked at random and without replacement from the bag, what is the probability that the two beads chosen are different in colour?<br />You cannot neglect the order in probability. That’s why the Letter Technique is so important.<br />These techniques help for GRE probability, which comes up only occasionally, and GMAT probability, which comes up all the time at the higher level. <br /><br />These examples help for the without replacement scenarios but are also applicable to the with replacement ones too. This is not advanced probability but a solid intro to quant probability and probability on the GRE and GMAT. It is an 11-minute answer of ‘how to do probability’. I will be very satisfied if, after watching this introduction to probability, you avoid these two common probability mistakes.<br /><br /><br /><br />Enquiries: philip@gretutorlondon.com <br /><br />I offer Skype/Zoom tutoring too! Rates are $130-140/hr.{% endraw %}
