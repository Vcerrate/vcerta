{% raw %}We have written a course in association with SAPHNA (the Schools and Public Health Nurses Association) about the administration of medication in schools.<br /><br />Schools and early years settings must have a policy and procedures in place for the administration of medication to children and young people. This course contains statutory and non-statutory guidance on the operation of such a system and the responsibilities of staff and parents.{% endraw %}
