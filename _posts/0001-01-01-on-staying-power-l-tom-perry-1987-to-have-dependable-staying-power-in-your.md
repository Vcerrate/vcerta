To me it is overwhelming to see all of you gathered here together and realize the great responsibility we both have—you, to your committed course of study and everything else that goes with being on your own in a college setting, and me, to help provide useful guidance and counsel to you. I hope you know of my love for each of you. I hope you feel of my concern for your welfare. I do care about you and want the best out of life for each of you.<br /><br />As I pondered this assignment, I discovered in my raw materials file an article entitled, “On Staying Power.” It was written by John Wooden, the legendary coach for UCLA, and printed in the Wall Street Journal on April 23, 1986. It reads in part:<br /><br />Like most coaches, my program revolved around fundamentals, conditioning, and teamwork. But I differ radically in several respects. I never tried to get my team “up” for a game emotionally, I never worried about how our opponents would play us, and I never talked about winning.<br /><br />I believe that for every artificial peak you create, you also create valleys. When you get too high for anything, emotion takes over and consistency of performance is lost and you will be unduly affected when adversity comes. I emphasized constant improvement and steady performance.<br /><br />I have often said, “The mark of a true champion is to always perform near your own level of competency.” We were able to do that by never being satisfied with the past and always planning for what was to come. I believe that failure to prepare is preparing to fail. This constant focus on the future is one reason we continued staying near the top once we got there.<br /><br />I probably scouted opponents less than any coach in the country. Less than most high school coaches. I don’t need to know that this forward likes to drive the outside. You’re not supposed to give the outside to any forward whenever he tries it. Sound offensive and defensive principles apply to any style of play.<br /><br />Rather than having my teams prepare to play a certain team each week, I prepared to play anybody. I didn’t want my players worrying about the other fellows. I wanted them executing the sound offensive and defensive principles we taught in practice.<br /><br />To me, success isn’t outscoring someone, it’s the peace of mind that comes from self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best. That’s something each individual must determine for himself. You can fool others, but you can’t fool yourself. [Wall Street Journal, April 23, 1986, p. 39]<br /><br />From the philosophy of this great coach, John Wooden, there are three principles I would like to discuss with you here today. The first is to develop a pattern in your life of consistently doing the best with the talents given you by our Father in Heaven. Second, subscribe to basic principles that are always appropriate for any situation or season of life. Third, develop character, rather than worry about your reputation.<br /><br />Principle Number One<br /><br />Develop a consistency in your lives of always trying to do the best with the talents you have. One of my favorite scriptures is found in the eighth chapter of Psalms.<br /><br />O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who has set thy glory above the heavens. . . .<br /><br />When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;<br /><br />What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?<br /><br />For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. [Psalms 8:1, 3–5]&quot;{% endraw %}
