{% raw %}10 Things I've Learned Raising Geese. I've been raising Emden geese for quite a while now and I'd like to share with you what I have learned. 5 Good things and 5 not so good things.  Let me just say that I enjoy having the geese on our farm and couldn't picture the farm without them. I'll take the good with the bad any day. Hope you find the video interesting and enjoy watching. If you want to see the geese grow up on the farm along with the daily farm life, please SUBSCRIBE.  Thanks. #geese #emdengeese #waterfowl{% endraw %}
