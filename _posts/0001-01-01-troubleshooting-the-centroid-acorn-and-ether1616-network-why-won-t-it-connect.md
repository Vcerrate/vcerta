{% raw %}Today we're troubleshooting why the Beelink computer cannot see the Centroid Ether1616 I/O board in my new CNC controller build.  It turned out to be a really subtle (fun) issue.  The system is running Centroid CNC12, with an Acorn and Ether1616 I/O Expander.  And when we're done, it will all be working.<br /><br />This appears to be a bug in the Realtek GbE network hardware of the Beelink computer.  But there's an easy workaround.<br /><br />00:22 Intro    <br />01:15 Demonstration    <br />02:53 Extracting the board    <br />04:43 Checking voltages and PINGing    <br />07:35 Sniffing the debug port    <br />13:38 Testing with another computer    <br />15:47 Testing with another network card    <br />17:11 Sniffing the network traffic    <br />18:55 A brief lesson in ARP    <br />21:52 Analyzing the network traces    <br />24:24 Network driver settings    <br />26:33 Fixed!    <br /><br />Tools used in this video:<br /><br />EEVBLOG Brymen BM235 Multimeter (Amazon*): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2YKFSEk">https://amzn.to/2YKFSEk</a><br />Saleae Logic Pro 16 Logic Analyzer (Amazon*): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3h3kaXN">https://amzn.to/3h3kaXN</a><br />Internetworking with TCP/IP Volume One (Amazon*): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3p4uMKD">https://amzn.to/3p4uMKD</a><br />Beelink SEI8 Mini PC (Amazon*): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35kOMBK">https://amzn.to/35kOMBK</a><br />Portable 14&quot; Touch-Screen Monitor (Amazon*): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3BCczJg">https://amzn.to/3BCczJg</a><br />USB C to Ethernet and USB Hub (Amazon*): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3BH4JOM">https://amzn.to/3BH4JOM</a><br />High Temperature ESD Safe Mat (Amazon*): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Xz0n6D">https://amzn.to/2Xz0n6D</a><br /><br />*These are affiliate links.
