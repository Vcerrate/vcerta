An archaeologist makes the discovery, and if they have enough knowledge to identify or explain it, they'll do so. If they don't, they'll turn to a scientist for assistance. When scientists can't help them, they're left with a mystery on their hands. We love those mysteries because we can take them and turn them into great videos like this one!<br /><br />For all questions contact us at: amazingstockchannel@gmail.com{% endraw %}
