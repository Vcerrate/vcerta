{% raw %}If you want to know what it is like to fly a piper Comanche 250, you have come to the wrong place. I bought one but I haven't figured out how to work it yet. I did decide that I should make a video about the plane with some marginally truthful information about the plane and the rest is made up nonsense. <br /><br />Truthfully if you are looking to buy a fast single engine aircraft. I strongly suggest you consider a piper Comanche. The Comanche 250 is a beast and you can get one far cheaper than the other planes in its class.<br /><br />The number one way you can help my channel is to share videos you like on your social media streams.<br /><br />Other ways to Support the channel <br />Become a Patreon Supporter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/JustPlaneSilly">https://www.patreon.com/JustPlaneSilly</a><br /><br />Subscribe if you haven't already.
