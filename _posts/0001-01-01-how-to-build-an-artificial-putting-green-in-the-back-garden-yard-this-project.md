{% raw %}This project was daunting to say the least. I spent hours looking into ways to complete the install and spoke at length with garden designers and professional turf companies. However, the end result was fantastic and has certainly helped the 3 lock downs in England.<br /><br />Here is how we completed the install of an artificial putting green in the garden. This was 9 months ago and the green still rolls as good as it did then... <br /><br />If I could change one thing, it would have been to add a layer of granite dust under the putting green area, however this was not available due to covid supply chain issues at the time..<br /><br />Grass is from flooringdirect.co.uk<br /><br />Pins and cups are from pinseeker.co.uk<br /><br />Let us know what you think and what would you have done differently?{% endraw %}
