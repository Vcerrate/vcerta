{% raw %}RR Victory Over Lucknow Shattered Playoffs Chances Of Other Teams | RR vs LSG 2022 | GBB Cricket<br />________________________________________<br /><br />Visit Our Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gbbstudios.in/">https://gbbstudios.in/</a><br />________________________________________<br /><br />Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players. A 22-yard (20-meter) pitch has a wicket at each end, two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets). In contrast, the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are &quot;out&quot;). Means of dismissal include being bowled when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails. The innings ended when ten batters were dismissed, and the teams swapped roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.<br /><br />Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single inning of 20 overs, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally, cricketers play in an all-white kit, but they wear club or team colors in limited-overs cricket. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball.
