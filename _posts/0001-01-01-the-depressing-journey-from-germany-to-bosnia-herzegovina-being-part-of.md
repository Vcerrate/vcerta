{% raw %}Being part of the diaspora of any nation is  a very confusing and melancholic experience. Having moved to Germany from Bosnia-Herzegovina in my teenage years, I’ve had my fair share of trips and visits back to the homeland, just like pretty much everyone who’s left family and friends behind in the pursuit of a better life. I’m sure many people can relate with this experience of departing into uncertain, uncharted territory and can vividly recall the precariousness and anxiety they experienced either as parents or as children in this context.<br /><br />However, the story I wish to share today is not about the emotional toll or day-to-day struggles of people who were forced to emigrate - but rather a truly depressing sensation an observant traveler may experience in his journey from Germany to Bosnia-Herzegovina, a personal observation so striking that it lingered at the back of my mind for quite some time now and has compelled me to explore this phenomenon more closely.<br /><br />►Support me on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/BalkanOdyssey">https://www.patreon.com/BalkanOdyssey</a><br /><br />►Follow me on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/balkan.odys...">https://www.instagram.com/balkan.odys...</a><br /><br />►Timestamps<br /><br />0:00 Introduction<br />1:16 Part 1 - The gradient of misery<br />9:01 Part 2 - Guilt, anger and helplessness<br />11:47 Part 3 - Imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism<br />16:02 Part 4 - The Balkan curse<br />19:38 Part 5 - Rebranding imperialism{% endraw %}
