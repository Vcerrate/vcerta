{% raw %}Fluency in English, as well as in any other language requires us to have a huge word bank or lexicon. But effective communication happens when we use the right words at the right time and for the right purpose. In this video I will discuss how to use PRETEND AND INTEND. <br /><br />INTRO<br />Hi and welcome, my name is sampson and this is engwitsam. <br /><br />Many of us use these two words incorrectly for many reasons. One reason that stands out, especial among Portuguese speaking students, is because of a word that sounds almost like PRETEND, but means INTEND when translated to the English language. <br /><br />This is why we hear students say things like: <br />I pretend to study English next week.<br />Instead of, <br />I intend to study English next week. <br /><br />To intend is to plan to do something. It is used to express plans you have for the future or things want to achieve. <br /><br />I intend to study English everyday in the next month. <br /><br />I intend to do my homework as soon as I get home. <br />It's wrong to say:<br />I Pretend to study English every day in the next week.<br /><br />When you pretend who act as if some is true even when you know it's not. You behave like something or someone you are not. <br /><br />The man pretends to be a teacher <br /><br />The woman pretended to be a lawyer. <br /><br />Don't forget to do the test at the end of the video.
