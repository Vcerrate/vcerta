{% raw %}Writing essays can literally be the worst thing ever for humanities students. No one told me how to write essays during my undergrad, and I wish someone gave me the advice I'm giving you. Essays, understandably, are intimidating. From the lecture notes, to the seminars, to reading and researching, there's so many extra steps before you even start writing. This video should take you all the way through these steps from a first-class graduate who wrote a lot of essays in her time. God speed, and good luck fellow humanities student! ❤️<br />____________________________________<br />TIME STAMPS: <br />Intro - 0:00<br />Step #1 (Humanities Degrees vs Other Degrees) - 2:01<br />Step #2 (Lectures &amp; Seminar Notes) - 4:07<br />Step #3 (Planning &amp; Researching) - 7:54<br />Step #4 (Writing) - 11:56<br />Outro - 14:02<br />____________________________________<br />//About Me//<br />Heya!
