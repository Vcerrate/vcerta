{% raw %}At the conclusion of today's National Dialogue on Safely Reopening America’s Schools President Donald Trump took a swipe at Harvard for doing online classes for the year. “They ought to be ashamed of themselves,” Trump said. <br /><br />Harvard will offer all of its classes for the next school year online, even as some students will be allowed back on campus amid the coronavirus pandemic, the school said Monday. <br /><br />Harvard’s faculty of arts and sciences said Monday it is planning to bring up to 40 percent of undergraduate students to campus, including all freshmen for the fall semester. <br /><br />The university said in a statement it is also allowing “those who must be on campus to progress academically” to return in the fall as well. <br /><br />Harvard will, however, offer all course instruction for undergraduate and graduate courses in the next academic year online. <br /><br />“Students will learn remotely, whether or not they live on campus,” the nation's oldest college said in a statement. <br /><br />Harvard said its priority “at this time” is to bring seniors back to campus.{% endraw %}
