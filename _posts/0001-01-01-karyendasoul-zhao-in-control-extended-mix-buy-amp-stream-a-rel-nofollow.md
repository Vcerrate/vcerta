Having previously remixed Zhao’s Surreal Sounds release ‘Magic’, Karyendasoul’s modern take on the Afro house sound makes a perfect match for Zhao’s dulcet voice, as seen on their Sondela debut ‘In Control’. Capturing our label's Where Afro meets tech intentions, Karyendasoul’s elegant combination of futuristic synth stabs and atmospheric chords make an otherworldly backdrop to Zhao’s vocal, as traditional percussion and rhythmic drums give the record its authentic Afro sound. Another release destined for the dance floor.<br /><br />Socials:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sondelareco...​">https://www.instagram.com/sondelareco...​</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Sondela-Reco...​">https://www.facebook.com/Sondela-Reco...​</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/sondela__​​​">https://twitter.com/sondela__​​​</a><br /><br />#SONDELA​​​{% endraw %}
