{% raw %}International media loves to portray South Sudan in a negative light. In this video, I show you  how the capital of South Sudan, Juba really looks like. As you will see, it's a beautiful young city on the verge of blooming. Just like any other African city, there are affluent neighborhoods and upcoming neighborhoods. South Sudanese are living normal lives. They go shopping, they party and enjoy life just like everyone. <br /> <br />-~-~~-~~~-~~-~--~-~~-~~~-~~-~--~-~~-~~~-~~-~--~-~~-~~~-~~-~--~-~~-~~-~--~-~~-~~~-~~-~--<br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />I hope you enjoyed today's content.
