{% raw %}.23 – that's how incredibly close Nick Willis was to breaking 4:00 in the mile for the 20th consecutive year on January 1st. In our latest film, we joined him for the aftermath and take two. Back to his Michigan routine of training, work and basketball with his family, teammates and coaches, Nick prepared to chase the record again – this time as part of a deep field at the Millrose Games. <br /><br />Camera Michigan: Chris Milliman, John Bujak<br />Camera NYC: Julian Focareta<br />Race footage courtesy of NBC<br />Sound: Jamie Scarpuzza<br />Sound Design: Tim Joy<br />Color: Kath Raisch<br />Edit: Chris Milliman<br />Still Photography: Johnny Zhang{% endraw %}
