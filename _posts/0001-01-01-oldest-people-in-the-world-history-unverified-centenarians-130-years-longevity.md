{% raw %}#longevity #comparison #oldestpeople<br /><br />This video includes claims of longevity of 130 and older from the 14th century onward. All birth year and age claims are alleged unless stated otherwise. Unverified centenarians (130+ years) are people whose age has not been confirmed by a group of gerontological studies, but who also have mentions in the media. <br /><br />Music: A Himitsu - Two Places<br />Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/S599rNzdtH0">https://youtu.be/S599rNzdtH0</a><br />Music provided by: FM - Fantastic Music{% endraw %}
