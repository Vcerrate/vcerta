{% raw %}Dimitri and Jacinia are a couple of minimalists living in an extra small 88 ft²/8 m² micro studio apartment to keep their expenses low and eventually save money to buy their first home.  Their rent is just $300 USD per month and includes loads of perks like laundry, access to a backyard, and internet.  The main living space is one single room in a basement that measures 8' x 11'.  They've organized it to have a home office space, a mini kitchenette, a Japanese futon mattress that can be rolled up and put away during the day, and a closet to store their bedding, extra food, and other hobby items.  Their cat is an important part of the family and she has a cat tree and a ramp that gives her exercise and space to curl up and nap.  In the public hallway of their multi-residential building, they have an armoire to keep their clothing, as well as access to two bathrooms – one with a toilet and sink, and the other with a shower.<br /><br />You can follow the Minimalist Vegan Lifestyle here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MinimalistVeganLifestyle">https://www.youtube.com/c/MinimalistVeganLifestyle</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/minimalistveganlifestyle/">https://www.instagram.com/minimalistveganlifestyle/</a><br /><br />And you can follow Dimitri Reyes Poet here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DimitriReyesPoet">https://www.youtube.com/c/DimitriReyesPoet</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dimitri__reyes/">https://www.instagram.com/dimitri__reyes/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dimitrireyespoet.com/">https://www.dimitrireyespoet.com/</a><br /><br />Puerto Rican Vegan Cookbook<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Puerto-Rican-Vegan-Cookbook-Traditional/dp/1075080681">https://www.amazon.com/Puerto-Rican-Vegan-Cookbook-Traditional/dp/1075080681</a><br /><br />Every First &amp; Fifteenth Poetry Book<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dimitrireyespoet.com/every-first-fifteenth/">https://www.dimitrireyespoet.com/every-first-fifteenth/</a><br /><br />Shadow Work for Poets Book:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Work-Poets-Prompts-Journey/dp/B09W46ZYKY">https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Work-Poets-Prompts-Journey/dp/B09W46ZYKY</a><br /><br />Jacinia and Dimitri have a budget and keep track all of their expenses and they share monthly budget reports over on the Minimalist Vegan Lifestyle YouTube channel.  While this super small apartment has given them the ability to live simply, spend less, and sometimes even work less, there are challenges to living in such an extremely tiny home.  They share walls and a ceiling with other tenants which can be noisy and lack privacy.  They also don't have a sink in their kitchenette so they have to do dishes and get water from the bathroom sink.  So there is definitely a trade-off and some sacrifice when choosing to live in such a small space.  <br /><br />This apartment is beautiful and functional in many ways and we're impressed with this couple's passion, creativity, and zest for life.  It's not easy to find affordable housing to rent or own these days and it's great to see an example of how to find alternative solutions and make them work.  <br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />Mat &amp; Danielle<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />STAY IN TOUCH!<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Website: www.exploringalternatives.ca<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/exploringalternativesblog">https://www.facebook.com/exploringalternativesblog</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/exploringalternatives/">https://www.instagram.com/exploringalternatives/</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />COMMENTS<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />We want our channel and our comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and contribute.
