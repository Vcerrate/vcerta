{% raw %}We've all had this argument at least once in our lives. How should children be raised? Should we hit them, or should we put them in concentration camps? I would argue that training an eagle to attack them would be far easier than raising a child...<br />DISCLAIMER: French Baguette Intelligence does not support harming children in any way. This video is not to be taken seriously and we will not make ourselves responsible for any sort of abuse towards anyone, inspired by this video.<br /><br />Ever wish French Baguette Intelligence could stalk you in every platform like an obsessed ex?
