{% raw %}The all-new Lincoln Corsair replaces the Lincoln MKC compact crossover. This new Lincoln Corsair compact utility shares the same platform as the Ford Escape. this new Lincoln Corsair small SUV is powered by the same 2.0L Ecoboost engine used in the Ford Escape with 250hp. The Optional 2.3L engine has 280hp but the base engine is adequate for most buyers. Both use an 8-speed automatic transmission and standard AWD in Canada. Lincoln is an iconic American luxury brand and by returning to proper names for its vehicles, brings back a romantic era of American motoring. The Lincoln Corsair compact utility has room for 5-passengers over two rows and is a larger vehicle than the MKC it replaces. The interior of the Lincoln Corsair is a major departure from the Ford cousin and has a level of materials and design that suites the rest of the Lincoln SUV family. The Infotainment system is the same as used by Ford, called the Sync3 system that is quick and seamless but lacks any differentiation from the Ford sibling. The dashboard is a 12.3-inch digital unit. The Lincoln Corsair small utility uses a passive spring suspension design but has active dampers for a smooth drive or sporty one depending on the driver's desire. The Corsair compact utility has the most engaging drive of the new Lincoln SUVs and is sporty and fun when asked. <br /><br />Get the dealership cost, any rebates and special interest rates, plus secret discounts, go to CarCostCanada.
