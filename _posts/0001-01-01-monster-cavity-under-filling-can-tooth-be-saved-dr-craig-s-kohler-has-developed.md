{% raw %}Dr. Craig S. Kohler has developed a new oral hygiene system, MOTSY Light, which empowers you to better oral health. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shoponvi.com">https://shoponvi.com</a> is the website with description of this new oral hygiene system.<br />He is among the few dentists in the country that for 20 years has been using live video, recording his dental procedures through microscopes, to deliver premium care for his patients. <br />Video Summary <br />This patient had a large silver filling with a pin. Extensive decay underneath the filling would lead someone to consider extracting it. The patient was able to avoid needing a root canal at this time but knows this will most likely happen. A crown should be placed on the tooth, but the patient can only afford a large filling at this time.{% endraw %}
