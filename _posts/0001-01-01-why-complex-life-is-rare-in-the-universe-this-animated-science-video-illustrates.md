{% raw %}This animated science video illustrates the factors that support the Rare Earth Hypothesis (advanced by Drs. Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee in their book, &quot;Rare Earth&quot;) that &quot;simple life may be widespread, but complex life is probably rare throughout the universe.&quot; Created by two student groups, ages 8-11 and 12-15,  in 15 hours each of class time, &quot;Why Complex Life is Rare&quot; is a LineStorm Animation project designed at the Creative Arts at Park School in Brookline, Massachusetts. Supervised by Pell Osborn of MotionArt Studios, Boston, the highly personalized science film (the animation originated entirely on flipbooks), concludes with a lively celebration of the vast variety of complex life on our Rare Earth. The Philadelphia Mummers' Parade Quaker City String Band performs the energetic soundtrack medley.{% endraw %}
