{% raw %}Jozef Israëls (1824-1911) - A Dutch painter referred to as the Hague School<br /><br />Jozef Israëls (27 January 1824 – 12 August 1911) was a Dutch painter. He was a leading member of the group of landscape painters referred to as the Hague School and, during his lifetime, &quot;the most respected Dutch artist of the second half of the nineteenth century&quot;.<br /><br />Israëls has often been compared to Jean-François Millet. As artists, even more than as painters in the strict sense of the word, they both, in fact, saw in the life of the poor and humble a motive for expressing with peculiar intensity their wide human sympathy; but Millet was the poet of placid rural life, while in almost all Israëls' pictures there is some piercing note of woe. Edmond Duranty said of them that they were painted with gloom and suffering.<br /><br />He began with historical and dramatic subjects in the romantic style of the day. By chance, after an illness, he went to recuperate his strength at the fishing-town of Zandvoort near Haarlem, and there he was struck by the daily tragedy of life. Thenceforth he was possessed by a new vein of artistic expression, sincerely realistic, full of emotion and pity.<br /><br />Among his more important subsequent works are The Zandvoort Fisherman (in the Amsterdam Gallery), The Silent House (which gained a gold medal at the Brussels Salon, 1858) and Village Poor (a prize at Manchester).<br /><br />In 1862, he achieved great success in London with his Shipwrecked, purchased by Mr Young, and The Cradle, two pictures that the Athenaeum magazine described as the most touching pictures of the exhibition. A portrait of Jozef Israëls was painted by the Scottish painter George Paul Chalmers .<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jozef_Isra%C3%ABls">https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jozef_Isra%C3%ABls</a><br /><br />The images are only being used for informational and educational purposes<br /><br />Text &amp; images:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jozef_Isra%C3%ABls">https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jozef_Isra%C3%ABls</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Jozef_Isra%C3%ABls">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Jozef_Isra%C3%ABls</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Paintings_by_Jozef_Isra%C3%ABls">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Paintings_by_Jozef_Isra%C3%ABls</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/search?p=1&amp;ps=12&amp;involvedMaker=Jozef%20Isra%C3%ABls&amp;st=Objects&amp;ii=1">https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/search?p=1&amp;ps=12&amp;involvedMaker=Jozef%20Isra%C3%ABls&amp;st=Objects&amp;ii=1</a><br />Photographer Joop anke:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/people/39073133@N07">https://www.flickr.com/people/39073133@N07</a><br /><br />Misic:<br />Canon in D Major<br />0:08 / 5:55<br />Kevin MacLeod<br />Clásica | Feliz<br />Puedes usar esta canción en cualquiera de tus vídeos, pero debes incluir el siguiente texto en la descripción:<br />Canon in D Major de Kevin MacLeod está sujeta a una licencia de Creative Commons Attribution (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a><br />Fuente: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100301">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100301</a><br />Artista: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a>{% endraw %}
