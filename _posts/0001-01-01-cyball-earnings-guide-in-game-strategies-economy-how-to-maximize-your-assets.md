{% raw %}Hustlepedia is back today with another crypto gaming, metaverse and NFT video as we dive into the new Play to Earn game Cyball, the turn based soccer game on the Binance Smart Chain that the guilds and scholars are flocking to similarly to recent games such as Pegaxy when it was at its heights. CyBall has a perfectly implemented rental economy for asset owners or scholar/guild managers to seamlessly rent your assets without hassles of security, splitting profits manually, etc. as its all automated right on the Cyball app. Along with the rental system the Cyball game is actually very fun and competitive especially for a turn based game, this game gets the competitive juices flowing. I cover everything you need to know from the CBT token launch (the earnings token in the Cyball economy), earnings potential including my exact earnings for the first 2 weeks of the game, my strategy for both rentals and actively playing, the upcoming genesis mentoring event and more. <br /><br />Be sure to LIKE the video if you enjoyed and SUBSCRIBE for more Crypto Gaming, Metaverse and NFT content.<br /><br />And leave you comments down below on Cyball and the state of P2E Gaming today!<br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/HustlepediaYT">https://twitter.com/HustlepediaYT</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hustle_nft/">https://www.instagram.com/hustle_nft/</a><br /><br />Crypto Banter &quot;In The Game&quot; Live M-F 1:30PM ET: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CryptoBanterGroup">https://www.youtube.com/c/CryptoBanterGroup</a><br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:14 My Daily Show on Crypto Banter<br />2:13 CBT Reward Claim Live<br />3:33 How to Claim Rewards<br />4:11 My 1st Claim Earnings <br />5:20 Expected Returns<br />7:00 Genesis Mentoring (Breeding)<br />10:00 CyBall Gameplay<br />12:22 CyLoans (Scholarships)<br />13:05 My Strategy Moving Forward<br />14:00 P2E Final Thoughts<br /><br />#CryptoGaming<br />#Metaverse<br />#CyBall{% endraw %}
