{% raw %}LETTING THE PERSON IN FRONT OF US DECIDE WHAT WE EAT FOR 24 HOURS!!!<br />LAST VIDEO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/AS4G8XQj_fk">https://youtu.be/AS4G8XQj_fk</a><br /><br />Info if you’re new here:<br />Hi! 👋🏻<br />We’re Jade and Rob, a British couple living in London. We’ve been together for 7 years and we’re engaged to be married at some point in the near future. On the 2nd January 2022 we met our new little bestie because we became parents to a beautiful baby girl named Koda and she is our entire world (we’re obsessed with our little nugget) and we also have a nephew &amp; niece called Bailey + Isabella who we adore (bailey is also referred to as “beau”). Rob loves the gym, NFL, football and finding his next tattoo lol and Jade’s obsessed with skincare stuff, reading books and continuously learning how to be the best mama to Koda and catering to her needs by researching everything baby related👶🏼. We’re HUGE on family time and love being in each other’s company (seriously, we’re long lost besties). We decided to create a channel together 3 years ago which has ultimately progressed into a family channel where you’ll see a mixture of family vlogs, food reviews and challenges. Feel free to subscribe and join us so you don't miss any uploads from us! 🙌🏻❤️<br />Jade and Rob x<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/jadeandrob">https://www.youtube.com/jadeandrob</a><br />OUR INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jadeandrob">https://www.instagram.com/jadeandrob</a><br />TIKTOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/TCKHgA/">https://vm.tiktok.com/TCKHgA/</a>{% endraw %}
