{% raw %}He's got a bit of a cheek to be demanding anything off this Country given how he has treated the Queen! Harry seems to forget he quit! Not only did he do this, he completely trashed his Grandparents, Father, Brother &amp; his sister in law. He and Meghan's Oprah interview actually increased the threats to the Royal Family and they have had to increase security because of what they said. Harry and Meghan have tried to paint the Royal Family to be racist which is unfounded and a very manipulative thing to do just so they could play victim.<br /><br />Harry has said he will pay for it, how very kind of him! The issue isn't about him privately funding the Police rather than it being taxpayers cash, it's the simple fact that the UK Scotland Yard Met Protection Officers are not for hire!! It seems Harry is obsessed about having trained and armed police officers with him and his family all the time!! It is a further embarrassment for the Queen that her Grandson is now going to sue the Government because he can not get his own way! It just makes him look entitled and completely out of touch with reality.<br /><br />Taz xxx{% endraw %}
