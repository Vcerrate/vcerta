{% raw %}Looong Train With 5 Locomotives Working Hard At A Railroad Crossing In The City!  This train is in Loveland, Ohio on the Indiana &amp; Ohio Railway.  Ohio Central Railroad locomotives and I&amp;O engines pull this heavy manifest on track that CSX ran when I lived by it.  We see the rusty rail before the train passes and then the shiny rail after the train passes.  This train sat for at least an hour just a few miles west of town before I started filming it.  I heard a crew give it a roll by inspection on 161.220 just before it entered Loveland.  I think they were having some sort of problem or possibly having a crew change because they sat on the mainline at Lake Remington where there are no sidings.  Loveland is a small city north east of Cincinnati.  This line was an old Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad line when I was a child and the Pennsylvania Railroad crossed it at grade just behind the train station in this video.  I saw trains on that line which is now a bike trail.  Mrs Tooth can be seen filming the train near the bike trail crossing and that video will be posted soon.  This video shows the house that I use to live in back in the mid 80s.  That house was next to the railroad crossing on Obannonville Road just a few miles out of Loveland and in Goshen Township.  When I lived there the line was ran by CSX, had close to 8 trains a day, had cabooses on every train and used 160.230.   Right after I moved they got rid of cabooses and the line cut down to only 2 trains a day.  Today I&amp;O runs about 3 or 4 trains a day.  Amtrak also ran on this line in the 70s.   The red and gray locomotive 4071 was built February 1979 for Southern Pacific Railroad.   It is also ex UP and is a tunnel motor.  Locomotive #4085 was built in October of 1977 for Canadian Pacific Railroad.   <br />     I noticed something after I filmed this.  Loveland is a No Train Horn Zone.  Notice the train blow its horn after it crosses the railroad crossing in front of me.  That next crossing was one of the first No Train Horn crossings in Ohio.  The gates appear to be vertical ( straight up and down ) as the train passes.   Looks like a malfunction.   Notice at 2:49 you can see the gates on both sides of the train and they are vertical.  <br />Filmed April 9, 2022CE<br />       Thanks for watching!
