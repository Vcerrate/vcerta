{% raw %}What's the difference between a lawyer vs attorney? When you look up the answer on the internet, almost every answer is wrong, usually claiming things like “A lawyer can give you legal advice because they’ve gone to law school, but they haven't passed the bar.” This would actually be a felony in Florida.<br /><br />At least in South Florida, it's not uncommon to see people that engage in the unlicensed practice of law like it’s no big deal. In order to be an informed consumer, you can verify every attorney has an active law license on that attorney’s state bar association’s website. <br /><br />Furthermore, see why Im wishing Kim Kardashian West the best of luck for the bar exam and why the odds are heavily stacked against her passing.<br /><br />Question of the day?: Have you ever needed a lawyer and your friend recommended his uncle who went to law school, their “family lawyer?” <br /><br /> Please subscribe to my channel. I don't even have 50 subscribers yet, but I'm trying to catch up to that handsome fellow Legal Eagle and this is your chance to subscribe on the ground floor and be part of this channel's historic climb to glory. ;){% endraw %}
