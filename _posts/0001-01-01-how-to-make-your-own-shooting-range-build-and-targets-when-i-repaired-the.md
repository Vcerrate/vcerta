{% raw %}When I repaired the main berm on our Tactical Rifleman range complex, a lot of viewers were asking &quot;Karl, how did you make your berm?&quot; and &quot;Wow, could you help me make my berm because I really want my own range?&quot;  <br />     <br />There is SO MUCH MORE to building a range than just building a berm.<br /><br />First, check local laws &amp; ordinances; then check your insurance.<br /><br />Next, decide on Range Fan and build your berm. Remember, berms settle about 30%. So, piling a pretty 10ft berm really only gets you a 7 foot tall berm. 12ft should be your goal.<br /><br />Targetry: Thatâ€™s the easy part; just go to MGM Targets and use promo code: TacR10<br /><br />Wrap it up with a solid Medical &amp; Evac plan, and you are ready to Zero the Deer Rifle. <br /><br />Strength and Honor, TR<br /><br />Help support Tactical Rifleman by becoming a patron on Patreon <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TacticalRifleman">https://www.patreon.com/TacticalRifleman</a><br /><br />My favorite source for  Night Vision, Thermal Imaging, Riflescopes and Lasers - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nightvisionguys.com/">https://www.nightvisionguys.com/</a><br /><br />Want the same gear as Karl check out the NEW Amazon shop<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/influencer-d7e0b284">https://www.amazon.com/shop/influencer-d7e0b284</a><br /><br />For more go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.tacticalrifleman.com/">http://www.tacticalrifleman.com/</a>   <br />Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TacticalRifleman/">https://www.facebook.com/TacticalRifleman/</a>  <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tactical_rifleman/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/tactical_rifleman/?hl=en</a>  <br /> Twitter-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/TACrman">http://bit.ly/TACrman</a>{% endraw %}
