{% raw %}Today we are installing blackout emblems and tailgate letters on a 3rd Gen Toyota Tacoma. <br /><br />Tacoma and 4x4 Emblems: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2U9znw2">https://amzn.to/2U9znw2</a><br />Tacoma, All Emblems: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/39azuLQ">https://amzn.to/39azuLQ</a><br />Tailgate letters: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2YSIGzJ">https://amzn.to/2YSIGzJ</a><br />Combo All Emblems and Tailgate Letters: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2HGAaya">https://amzn.to/2HGAaya</a> (this is what I got)<br /><br />This can be done in minutes. It is such a simple install. the emblems are perfectly designed to fit directly over the top of the chrome decals. It's really as simple as removing the 3M adhesive backing and then apply the Blackout Emblem to the chrome decal. <br /><br />The Tailgate Letters are only slightly more tricky because you actually have to put them into place. Just take your time and don't push them down firmly till you are sure about their fitment. <br /><br />Don't forget to subscribe!<br /><br />-- keep crawling --<br /><br />*******************************<br />FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA<br /><br />Website â€“ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://snailtrail4x4.com">http://snailtrail4x4.com</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/snailtrail4x4/">https://www.facebook.com/snailtrail4x4/</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/snailtrail4x4">https://instagram.com/snailtrail4x4</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SnailTrail4x4">https://twitter.com/SnailTrail4x4</a><br />Google+ - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/105004491...">https://plus.google.com/u/1/105004491...</a><br /><br />*******************************<br />LIST OF MY CAMERA GEAR<br /><br />DJI OSMO - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2vMqTPP">http://amzn.to/2vMqTPP</a><br />Rode VideoMicro (compact) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2fxEy6S">http://amzn.to/2fxEy6S</a><br />DJI Mic Mount - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2vMxTMJ">http://amzn.to/2vMxTMJ</a><br />GoPro Hero 3+ Silver - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2vWmJFu">http://amzn.to/2vWmJFu</a><br />GoPro Aluminum Housing w/ mic mount - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2uNYep3">http://amzn.to/2uNYep3</a><br />GoPro Mic Cable - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2vudOrU">http://amzn.to/2vudOrU</a> (cheap by 2, they will break)<br />Rode VideoMicro Go - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2hRkoW9">http://amzn.to/2hRkoW9</a> (No Batteries Version)<br />Bendy TriPod - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2vMs9m0">http://amzn.to/2vMs9m0</a> (DSLR Version)<br />Bendy TriPod Head - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2uNxMfb">http://amzn.to/2uNxMfb</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER:<br />Some of these links are affiliate links at no additional cost to you.
