{% raw %}With just 14 days to shoot, we set out to the Greek islands with a goal to bring the famed destination to life like never before. We’d use predominantly FPV to create a thrilling ride through countless locations across Santorini and Mykonos, but without missing out on capturing and conveying the subtle beauty of the culture and people at each location we shot. Our need to travel both wide and deep led us to partner up with Katikies.<br /><br />All 7 Katikies properties became our revolving home-base for the shoot, not to mention central characters in the resulting film. From sunrise to sunset we’d shoot in the stunning rooms, pools, restaurants, and corridors before diving into the views and setting out to film at nearby locations like Red Beach, Black Beach, Ammoudi, Mykonos Town, or Earth and Water Pottery Studio. Katikies was more than a sanctuary, the hotel and its staff was an expert concierge to truly experiencing the islands, arranging everything from yacht excursions to authentic cavernous wine tastings for us.  <br /><br />We experienced the magic of Greece all throughout the shooting process and we hope you feel it while watching the video. Look for it in the painted canvas of the intro scene which a local artist painted for us in under 24 hours, and in the violinist at Red Beach who agreed to climb to a peak and play his songs on a more dramatic stage for us, and in the steady hands of potterist Andreas Makaris who never tired of our studio visits to capture one more angle. Thank you for all the magic, Greece! <br /><br />The Hotels:<br />Katikies | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.katikies.com/">https://www.katikies.com/</a><br /><br />Music:<br />Jai Wolf | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jaiwolfx">https://www.instagram.com/jaiwolfx</a><br />Song: &quot;Moon Rider&quot;<br />Track: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3PP9CXeE0PYaM5GIGQqBIV?si=416ae12319e849cf">https://open.spotify.com/track/3PP9CXeE0PYaM5GIGQqBIV?si=416ae12319e849cf</a><br /><br />The Beautiful Destinations Team:<br />Matias De Rada | Director, Filmmaker, &amp; Editor | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/matiasderada">https://www.instagram.com/matiasderada</a><br />Gaston Luna | Filmmaker &amp; Assistant Editor | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gaston_luna">https://www.instagram.com/gaston_luna</a><br />Christian Basher | VFX | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/cristianbasher/">https://www.instagram.com/cristianbasher/</a><br />Reme Morales | FPV Drone Pilot | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/reme_martyr">https://www.instagram.com/reme_martyr</a><br />Lizzy Cole | Art Director &amp; Producer | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lizzymcole">https://www.instagram.com/lizzymcole</a><br />Konstantinos Sigalas | Producer | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/k.sigalas">https://www.instagram.com/k.sigalas</a><br />Nick Evans | Producer | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/nickevansbd">https://www.instagram.com/nickevansbd</a><br /><br />Special Thanks To:<br />Vassia Kostara | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/vassia_kostara">https://www.instagram.com/vassia_kostara</a><br />Elly Stark | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/starkellen">https://www.instagram.com/starkellen</a><br />Dimitris Tzanetakos | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dimitristzanetakos_">https://www.instagram.com/dimitristzanetakos_</a><br />Joanne Mindrinou | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ioanna_mindrinou">https://www.instagram.com/ioanna_mindrinou</a><br />Santorini Horse Riding | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/santorini_horse_riding">https://www.instagram.com/santorini_horse_riding</a><br /><br />#Katikies #Greece #Santorini #Mykonos #JaiWolf{% endraw %}
