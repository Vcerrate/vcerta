{% raw %}For those of us who feel like we can never get ahead, and feel like there is something inside of us that holds us back. There is. <br />It's important to understand how we were set up in order to be able to move past the things that are holding us back. You are not intrinsically flawed, but you may remember feeling incapable a lot of the time especially if you grew up in a traumatic environment under traumatic beliefs . <br />I hope this video is helpful in understanding yourself a little bit better. There is a way forward and you are not alone in the journey. <br />The next time you feel inadequate, remind yourself where it comes from and that you no longer need to believe it. <br />🙏🏼- Angel{% endraw %}
