{% raw %}Washington Gun Law President, William Kirk, discusses a hot topic in the 2A community which is how the ATF has essentially stipulated to facts sufficient to establish that Assault Rifle Bans are unconstitutional.  Sound too good to be true?  Well follow the trail and the line of thinking that many in the YouTubeiverse have recently commented on.  Learn how, in justifying their new rules on frames and receivers, the ATF, DOJ and Attorney General just stated, in writing, the one fact necessary to establish the constitutional violations created by bans in state such as California, New York, New Jersey and Hawaii to name a few.  <br /><br />And remember that the Washington state legislature has attempted an assault rifle ban for two consecutive sessions now, so, arm yourself with education today.  <br />_________________________________________________________________<br />Applicable Materials:<br /><br />District of Columbia v.
