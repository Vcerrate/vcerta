{% raw %}We're back againnnn, it was only right we did an episode on these legends in the game Krept and Konan. From everything they've done with their music and bodies of work, to BBC Rap Game, opening up Crepes and Cones. Co-signing the likes of Digdat and Abra Cadabra. It was only right we found out if these are real Krept and Konan fans! <br /><br />Got a dope idea for us? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://forms.gle/1B74nTBvUeKi5CqP9">https://forms.gle/1B74nTBvUeKi5CqP9</a><br /><br />Follow CORD on socials:<br />► Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/Cordsocials/">https://www.instagram.com/Cordsocials/</a><br />► Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Cordsocials">https://twitter.com/Cordsocials</a><br /><br />► Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE to CORD <br />► Watch more content - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP5KO_MmGxLV-lMLiGkDiPw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP5KO_MmGxLV-lMLiGkDiPw</a><br /><br />Stay tuned by subscribing to our channel to keep up with all the latest content within the scene.<br /><br />For Artists/Brands interested in partnering with CORD, email us:<br />hello@cordsocials.com{% endraw %}
