{% raw %}Forties Original was a clothing brand out of Deluxe spearheaded by Mr. Cornhole (aka TG) in the early/ mid 90â€™s. Basic attire, skate inspired goods for the everyday.<br /><br />The garments were cut and sewn in SF and Oakland - when you could still buy a burrito for under $5. <br /><br />I hand delivered all the bolts of fabric and parts (zippers/buttons/rivets, etc.) in our old Astro van that smelled like teen spirit after a heavy session and 6 too many. Ahh the good ol' daze.<br /><br />- Tommy Guerrero{% endraw %}
