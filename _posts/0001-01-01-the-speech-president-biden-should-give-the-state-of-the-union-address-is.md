{% raw %}The State of the Union address is always filled with platitudes and self-praise.  I wish the speech would be more like this.  <br />————<br />To make sure you see the new weekly video from Stossel TV, sign up here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.johnstossel.com/#subscribe">https://www.johnstossel.com/#subscribe</a><br />————<br />The first line of President Biden’s State of the Union should be, “my fellow Americans, I apologize.”<br /><br />For COVID mistakes.<br /><br />For reckless spending.<br /><br />And much more. <br /><br />There is so much this president, and every president, gets wrong.<br /><br />The speech should be much simpler.<br /><br />“I pledge to do less. And follow the Constitution.&quot;{% endraw %}
