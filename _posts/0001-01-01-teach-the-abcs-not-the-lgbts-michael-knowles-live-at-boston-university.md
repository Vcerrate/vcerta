{% raw %}From pronouns to puberty blockers, the Left is forcing Americaâ€™s children to learn about gender identity and transgender ideology, all while encouraging kids as young as five years old to engage in dangerous sexual activities. Michael Knowles is LIVE from Boston University to make the case for bringing the ABCs back to our education system to replace the LGBTs.<br /><br />This event is part of Young America's Foundation's Logan Family Lecture Series.<br /><br />Michael Knowles, described by Vanity Fair as &quot;a dapper, lib-triggering troll,&quot; is the host of The Michael Knowles Show on the Daily Wire. Knowles is the author of the #1 bestselling (and blank inside) &quot;Reasons To Vote For Democrats: A Comprehensive Guide.&quot; Knowles frequently appears on national news and commentary programs to provide insight into issues facing Americans.{% endraw %}
