{% raw %}Hello friends! <br /><br />Dice blanks! What are they? Why do makers use them? What can you do with them? Today I’ll be going over these questions and showing a few examples of what I primarily use blanks for. I hope you enjoyed, hope you learned something, and I’ll see you in the next one! <br /><br />You can find my socials at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/dreamydice">https://linktr.ee/dreamydice</a> or @dreamy_dice pretty much everywhere.{% endraw %}
