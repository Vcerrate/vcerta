It's all about the trays and layering. The knick-knacks.<br />2. One-of-a-kind items like big nose sculptures (lmao) are unique and interesting. If you're drawn to something, perhaps you should buy it?<br />3. Rugs and curtains tie the space together and make it feel more like a home. If this apartment hadn't come with those beige curtains (and if it didn't cost €500 to redo them), I definitely would have bought burgundy baroque curtains to give it more of a castle vibe.<br />4. Spend your money on things that will take up space (a  big rug, a sofa, a big painting). You can get knick knacks like frames, bowls, and vases at flea markets.<br />5. If you can get a view, get a view. No possession is worth more than a beautiful view you see every day.<br /><br />📀 Related Videos + Links<br />What my $1200 NYC apartment looks like <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Vkcs5zWtrb8">https://youtu.be/Vkcs5zWtrb8</a><br />What my $1100 Los Angeles apartment looks like <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/q9bGAAYR2MY">https://youtu.be/q9bGAAYR2MY</a><br />What my €995 Paris apartment looks like <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mlU9D2Vx47I">https://youtu.be/mlU9D2Vx47I</a>{% endraw %}
