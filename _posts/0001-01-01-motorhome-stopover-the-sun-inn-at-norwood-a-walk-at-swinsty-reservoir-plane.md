{% raw %}It's Saturday again and the Slaws head out on another motorhome stopover.<br /><br />This weekend it's at The Sun Inn at Norwood, just west of Harrogate. They travel in Helga, their Hobby motorhome @Hobby Caravaning with their two Lhasa apso dogs Billy and Jessie.<br /><br />It's a beautiful winter's day, but there is a lot of mud to contend with between the pub and the reservoir!<br /><br />Sadly, it's not possible to complete a circular walk due to path closures, but it's still a lovely walk. @Yorkshire Water <br /><br />Back to the pub for tea and as usual a few beverages. A great night's sleep and next morning, the Slaws go to Leeds Bradford airport for plane spotting.<br /><br />The insta360 camera captures an awesome shot of a plane coming in! Mrs Slaw cooks up a full English in the motorhome kitchen.{% endraw %}
