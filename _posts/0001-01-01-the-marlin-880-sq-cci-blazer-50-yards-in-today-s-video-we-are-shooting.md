{% raw %}In today's video, we are shooting a very unique rifle: the Marlin 880SQ.It was the last heavy barrel rimfire produced my Marlin before they sold to Remington. This rifle is in a Boyd's stock and has a 2.5x10x Tasco scope mounted on it. Hope you enjoy the video, thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
