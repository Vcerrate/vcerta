{% raw %}Lots of folks are pissed that 9.2.5 has basically no content and at best, it’s trying to rehash old stuff but really, how could they start making old content relevant again? We think this is the best way moving forward to Dragonflight and if this pans out nice while feedback is being constantly listened too, we should all be expecting some awesome stuff in the future.<br /><br />Join the Family! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/marcelianonline">https://www.patreon.com/marcelianonline</a><br />Merch <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.teepublic.com/stores/marcelianonline?ref_id=26022">https://www.teepublic.com/stores/marcelianonline?ref_id=26022</a> <br />Discord <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/marcelianonline">https://discord.com/invite/marcelianonline</a><br />Twitch <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/marcelianonline">https://twitch.tv/marcelianonline</a><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/marcelianonline">https://twitter.com/marcelianonline</a>{% endraw %}
