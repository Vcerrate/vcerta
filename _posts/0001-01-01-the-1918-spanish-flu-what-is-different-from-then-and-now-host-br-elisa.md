PLEASE NOTE THAT I DO NOT MAKE A PROFIT ON ANYTHING CHANNELING ERIK. Proceeds from all of the CE events go to those who host it. Royalties from the books will probably never pay for the money I was required to spend on a publicist and other things. So the only monies I receive are donations and a paltry amount from YouTube ad revenue and that covers 50% of my ongoing overhead. My husband and I are willing to cover the rest. On top of that, I gave up a lucrative medical practice to do what I do because I feel like I can save more people this way and because, as mother who deeply loves and misses her son, I want to help him feel productive, happy and fulfilled. So please, no more haters thinking I'm some evil person exploiting her son. It's simply not true. Quite the opposite. <br /><br />After my son, Erik Medhus, took his own life, he began to visit friends, family and the readers of my blog, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://channelingerik.com​​.">https://channelingerik.com​​.</a> Eventually, he began to share what he had learned from the Other Side. This channel will include either videos or audio only recordings of his insight and wisdom. All of them explore the true nature of death, the afterlife, reality, the soul and the human experience — as told by Erik himself, translated by world renowned mediums as well as an occasional guest medium. The material found in this channel are the first of its kind to provide answers, directly from Heaven. Please like this video if you enjoyed it, and join his blog at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://channelingerik.com​​.">https://channelingerik.com​​.</a> Listen carefully for Erik's voice as, though we never hear it live, he sometimes leaves them on the recording. Please let me know if you hear one because I never listen to the video after I record it.
