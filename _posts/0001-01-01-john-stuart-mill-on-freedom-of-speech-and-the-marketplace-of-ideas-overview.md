{% raw %}We’re taking a look at John Stuart Mill’s arguments for freedom of speech in chapter 2 of On Liberty (On the Liberty of Thought and Discussion). In particular, we’ll discuss the idea of the marketplace of ideas.<br /><br />We will also take a look at Mill's specific justifications for a bright-line rule against censorship:<br /><br />1. The prohibited opinion may be true, <br />2. A censored opinion may be partly true,<br />3. False opinions help give us a better understanding of true opinions, and <br />4. False ideas are necessary for the intellectual development of individuals and society. <br /><br />Mill’s arguments about freedom of speech and thought have been overwhelmingly influential in the United States (and elsewhere), so we’ll go on to take a look at how Mill’s arguments have influenced US first amendment jurisprudence.<br /><br />Spoiler: it’s copied pretty much verbatim.<br /><br />Come and join the discussion through chat - and consider subscribing if you enjoyed the discussion!{% endraw %}
