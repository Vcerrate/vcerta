{% raw %}Here is the first video of a mega 9 hours spotting visit to Lisbon Airport in Portugal. As I describe it, I did from one TAAG to another haha. <br /><br />Here is the first 90 minutes anyway on a hot late Spring day, with temperatures up at 24 degrees. I found this nice little spot on a spotting guide on the net, however hardly any videos on youtube from this spot, so I took a risk in going here as to whether it was good or not. Turned out to be a brilliant spotting area! <br /><br />A lot of movements here. This part of the video was shot between 10:40am to 14:40pm. Thats 4 hours worth of footage, with more to come. <br /><br />The video includes: TAP A319's, A320's, A321's, E190's, ATR 72-600's, A330's and an A340, Azul Linhas A330-200, TAAG Angola 777-300, Emirates 777-300, American 757, United 757, SATA Azores A310, Easyjet A319's and A320's, Ryanair 737's, Lufthansa A321's, Vueling A320, Monarch A321, Luxair 737, Brussels A320 and many many more!<br /><br />If you enjoyed this video, please like, comment, share and subscribe!<br /><br />-Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Platter1199">https://twitter.com/Platter1199</a><br /><br />-Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Casey-Plane-Spotting-FB-1690534827843943/">https://www.facebook.com/Casey-Plane-Spotting-FB-1690534827843943/</a>{% endraw %}
