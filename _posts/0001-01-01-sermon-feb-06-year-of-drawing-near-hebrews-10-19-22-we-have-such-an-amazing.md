{% raw %}We have such an amazing privilege - to draw near to God - because Jesus - by his death and resurrection - has opened the way into the Father's very presence. In 2022, letâ€™s make sure we are doing just that. Put away any insecurities or fears. Cast aside any distractions; block any temptations... and let us draw ever closer to our great and wonderful heavenly Father.{% endraw %}
