Selling a limited variety of pure vegetarian breads, buns and biscuits, the bakery fell upon hard times due to the rationing of flour and other essentials in the seventies. Faced with dire prospects, Ramaswamy Iyengar looked at the plentiful groundnut for survival and in doing so hit upon a unique recipe combining peanuts with a blend of spices that he named the Congress kadlekai, owing to the legend that during British times, secret notes were sent by Indian National Congress party workers hidden in sacks of groundnuts. I spent an afternoon with the second and third generation of the Sreenivasa Brahmins Bakery family to watch the making of the iconic Congress kadlekai and also taste some of the traditional items that make this 66-year-old institution a hit not just with locals, but also with Bengaluru diaspora across the globe who throng here for the kadlekai, nippat, khara buns, palya buns, puffs and other traditional Iyengar bakery treats. <br /><br />KBC<br />Rs. 35 (usd 0.5)<br />8.5/10<br /><br />Palya bun<br />Rs. 25 (usd 0.3)<br />9.5/10<br /><br />Capsicum puff<br />Rs. 25 (usd 0.3)<br />9/10<br /><br />Baked nippat<br />Rs. 50 (usd 0.7) for a pack of 10<br />8/10<br /><br />Congress kadlekai<br />10/10<br />Rs. 440  (usd 5.9) per kilo<br /><br />Bonda kadalebeeja<br />8/10<br />Rs. 400 (usd 5.4) per kilo<br /><br />Kadale fry<br />8/10<br />Rs. 400 (usd 5.4) per kilo<br /><br />Pepper kadlekai<br />8.5/10<br />Rs. 400 (usd 5.4) per kilo<br /><br />Honey cake<br />Rs. 25 (usd 0.3)<br />7.5/10<br /><br />Happy Eating!<br /><br />Kripal Amanna,<br />Gourmet On The Road,<br />Food Lovers TV<br /><br />Subscribe To our second channel at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/KripalAmannaVlogs">https://www.youtube.com/c/KripalAmannaVlogs</a> <br /><br />ADDRESS - Sreenivasa Brahmins Bakery (Old outlet), Building, Shop No. 125, 1st Floor Abalashram, DVG Road, Basavanagudi, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560004, tel:- +91 78299 01153<br />LOCATION TAG - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/boZgDF7EWCiF7jZc7">https://goo.gl/maps/boZgDF7EWCiF7jZc7</a>   <br />TIMINGS - 9am to 9pm <br /><br />Sreenivasa Brahmins Bakery (New outlet),opposite to Dodda Ganesha temple,<br />Bull Temple Road, Basavanagudi, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560019, tel:- +91 78299 01153<br />LOCATION TAG - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/VVeU416Yzv5sxjPC8">https://goo.gl/maps/VVeU416Yzv5sxjPC8</a>    <br />TIMINGS - 830am to 9pm <br /><br /><br />SUPPORT FOOD LOVERS <br />If you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the ‚Äòjoin‚Äô button below or on the home page.
