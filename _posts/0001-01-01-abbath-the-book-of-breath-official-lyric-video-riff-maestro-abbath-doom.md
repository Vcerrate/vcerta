{% raw %}Riff-maestro Abbath Doom Occulta cements his place among the heavy metal hierarchy with ‘Dread Reaver,’ his third album with eponymous project ABBATH. His signature blend of blistering speed metal, traditional metal influences, and touch of ice-cold black metal create a sound and style that is distinctly his. It’s spirited, balls-to-the-walls energy certifies ‘Dread Reaver’ as the quintessential anthem for galloping forth into the pit. <br /><br />► Order 'Dread Reaver' here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://redirect.season-of-mist.com/AbbathDreadReaver">https://redirect.season-of-mist.com/AbbathDreadReaver</a><br />► Pre-save on your favorite streaming service: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://orcd.co/abbath-dreadreaver">https://orcd.co/abbath-dreadreaver</a><br />► More info+ a detailed bio: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://season-of-mist.com/bands/abbath/">https://season-of-mist.com/bands/abbath/</a><br /><br />#abbath #dreadreaver #abbathdoomocculta<br /><br />Mastered by Maor Appelbaum at Maor Appelbaum Mastering  www.maorappelbaum.com<br />Music: Abbath<br />Lyrics: Simon Dancaster<br /><br />Follow Abbath<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.abbath.net">http://www.abbath.net</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/abbathband">https://www.facebook.com/abbathband</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/abbath_official">https://www.instagram.com/abbath_official</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://abbath.bandcamp.com">https://abbath.bandcamp.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1epGwdbjU7JSGVBHlqptpx?si=5xkD-3WIT5ayopFR5OZVEg">https://open.spotify.com/artist/1epGwdbjU7JSGVBHlqptpx?si=5xkD-3WIT5ayopFR5OZVEg</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Season Of Mist for new releases : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://som.lnk.to/YouTube">https://som.lnk.to/YouTube</a><br /><br />Follow Season Of Mist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.season-of-mist.com">http://www.season-of-mist.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/seasonofmistofficial">http://www.facebook.com/seasonofmistofficial</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/seasonofmistofficial">https://twitter.com/seasonofmistofficial</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/seasonofmistofficial">https://www.instagram.com/seasonofmistofficial</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SeasonOfMistLabel">http://www.youtube.com/user/SeasonOfMistLabel</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/seasonofmist">https://open.spotify.com/user/seasonofmist</a><br /><br />---<br />Season of Mist has always been known for being an innovative and wide spectrum label, interested in exploring and developing new artists and bands.
