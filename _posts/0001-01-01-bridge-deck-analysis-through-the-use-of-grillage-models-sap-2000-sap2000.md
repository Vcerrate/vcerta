{% raw %}SAP2000 software is extensive in analyzing the structures in both two dimensional and three dimensional format. It has the advantage of drawing windows of different planes and navigates for live multiple models and for complex modes. It is very effective in controlling complex geometries and easy to describe the concrete or steel shapes or fix modulus of elasticity for any materials particularly for composite construction.<br />SAP2000 software was used to analyze box girder bridges and to determine its structural response, a three dimensional (3D) finite element model was created using shell elements to determine load distribution factors and transverse shear under CHBDC truck loading{% endraw %}
