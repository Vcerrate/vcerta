{% raw %}Live presentation from BAU online 2021<br /><br />Thermal bridges, in combination with condensation and cool masonry, can lead to mould growth. The solution to make the room habitable again quickly: E-NERGY CARBON.<br />The heating foil is simply filled in and keeps the surface temperature permanently above the dew point. Moisture, the cause of mould growth, is thus permanently prevented.{% endraw %}
