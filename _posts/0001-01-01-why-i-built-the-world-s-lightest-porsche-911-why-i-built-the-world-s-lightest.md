{% raw %}'Why I built the world's lightest Porsche 911'. Richard King's 1968 911 is the lightest 911 ever. The stat you are wanting to know is 627kg. <br /><br />And yes, it’s road legal. <br /><br />This project car started as a 1968 911 that was bought as a badly modified (stripped) US import with no drivetrain.<br /><br />Thanks for stopping by The Late Brake Show. <br /><br />Originally the plan was to turn this cheap butchered bodyshell has turned into a 911 R replica. 911 Rs were the race special made in-house in 1967, and tipped the scales at a smidge over 800kg. Light. Bonkers basic. Richard started to plan his own version of this, but then got a bit carried away with the drill bits. Every hole was indeed his goal, because every component was analysed for its strength and purpose, then weighed, then onto a diet of grinding, drilling or sometimes replaced with a lighter custom part. Some for aesthetics, some for dietary reasons. <br /><br />If it doesn't need to be there, it isn't there. Just enough to fully function not fold like origami, but also pass an MoT. It looks akin to a skeletal mechanical wristwatch, doesn't it?<br /><br />To read more about the story of this car and why Jonny wanted to feature it, then head over and join our Patreon gang: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/TheLateBrakeShow">https://patreon.com/TheLateBrakeShow</a><br /><br />***********<br />Merch shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelatebrakeshow.com/shop">https://thelatebrakeshow.com/shop</a><br />******<br />Become a Patreon supporter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/TheLateBrakeShow">https://patreon.com/TheLateBrakeShow</a><br />******<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thelatebrakeshow.com">http://www.thelatebrakeshow.com</a><br />******<br />SUBSCRIBE for a broad-church of automotive appreciation spanning EV, classic, modified and future tech.<br />********<br />Filmed and edited by: Phil Vaughn Pritchard <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.philvfilms.com/">https://www.philvfilms.com/</a><br />Thumbnail by: Matt Tarrant <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.matttarrantdesign.com">https://www.matttarrantdesign.com</a> <br /><br />****************<br />Jonny Smith<br />Creative content maker, car presenter &amp; car pervert for hire since '98<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.carpervert.com">http://www.carpervert.com</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/jonnycarpervert">http://www.instagram.com/jonnycarpervert</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/carpervert">http://www.twitter.com/carpervert</a><br /><br />CHAPTERS <br />0:00 Intro<br />1:00 Who is Richard King?<br />3:40 Workshop tour<br />4:13 356 Carrera<br />5:13 Porsche 914<br />6:27 Backstory to 911 R replica<br />7:31 Donor shell<br />8:27 A bet for sub 700kg was made<br />8:49 Another diet for sub 600kg<br />9:44 Inspired by Lotus<br />10:46 DRIVING<br />13:00 Front end details<br />15:24 Holes under the bonnet <br />18:12 DRIVING<br />19:23 Interior details<br />22:22 DRIVING<br />24:02 Custom wheels<br />25:00 Rear end details<br />25:44 Engine details<br />26:14 Engine tech spec<br />28:01 Bodyshell and paint details<br />28:52 Verdict and thanks<br /><br /><br /><br />#lightestporsche911 #911r #porsche911outlaw #project911 #worldslightestcar #thelatebrakeshow #aircooled911 #4k{% endraw %}
