{% raw %}The list of reasons why dogs make incredible pets is endless! It doesn’t even matter if you’re a dog person or a cat person for the most part – it’s impossible to deny how adorable and useful at the same time dogs can be! Whether you’re looking for a fluffy pet or you work in the police department and need help with a murder case, there’s a breed of dog that’s made for you! That’s what we call range. Some of these dogs are so incredibly powerful that even taking on wildcats is no big deal for them!  <br /><br />Here are the 10 dog breeds that can take on lions and other such big cats!<br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ">https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ</a><br /><br />Watch our “10 Strange Animals Created By Humans”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ESgjejg-kBI">https://youtu.be/ESgjejg-kBI</a><br />Watch our “10 Teens You Won't Believe Exist!”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/dFr1xqTsQvE">https://youtu.be/dFr1xqTsQvE</a><br />Watch our “10 Scariest Insects You Wish Didn't Exist”<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/4ZfOVq_mWn8">https://youtu.be/4ZfOVq_mWn8</a><br /><br />Tibetan Mastiff<br /><br />If there’s one dog you never wanna mess with, it’s the Tibetan Mastiff! This large livestock guardian dog generally has a height of 66 cm, weighing up to 75 kg. And let’s not even talk about how insanely powerful it is. This dog can rip anyone to shreds no matter who they are! It’s not surprising then that the Tibetan Mastiff, or even many other breeds of Mastiffs in general, can take up lions, tigers, and other wildcats if they wanted to! Interestingly, Tibetan Mastiffs aren’t just incredibly powerful; they’re also one of the most ancient breeds that have historically been used to protect homes in the Himalayan region. That says everything you need to know about how dangerous and dominant Mastiffs can be!<br /><br />Rhodesian ridgeback<br /><br />You know an animal isn’t to be taken lightly when it has a history of being used for hunting lions and fending off baboons! Have a look at the Rhodesian ridgeback – a super-powerful as well as an incredibly helpful dog with a ridge on its back that originates from Rhodesia, a place now known as Zimbabwe.  Rhodesian ridgebacks aren’t just impressive when it comes to their physical build; instead, their mental abilities are just as awesome! After all, lion-hunting isn’t for everyone, and for an animal to truly excel at the game, it needs to be strong enough to bear the physical rigors of the hunt while having enough agility to dart out of the way of slashing claws!<br /><br /><br />Follow Us On Social Media <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► For copyright issues, send us an email at : factsjunkie@gmail.com{% endraw %}
