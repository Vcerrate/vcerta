{% raw %}​@Matt Cruz reveals why most Christians are MISSING their destiny!<br />▶▶Empowered for Victory by Matt Cruz [5-CD Set]: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/34z9KMY">https://bit.ly/34z9KMY</a><br />▶▶Empowered for Victory by Matt Cruz [Digital Download]: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3I6rDk1">https://bit.ly/3I6rDk1</a><br /><br />Somewhere beyond your comfort zone…<br /><br />Matt Cruz says Jesus is calling you to a place beyond your comfort zone, but familiar nonetheless.<br /><br />Empowered for Victory, Matt’s 5-CD/audio series, points to what God has already told us about the season of Jesus’ return. Your bridegroom is coming for His glorious bride, boots and all!<br /><br />Matt says it’s time to ask questions about that because you have a destiny NOW, not 2,000 years ago. And you can prepare once you say yes to your place as THE glorious bride. Matt helps you order your first steps by:<br /><br />• Praying with new focus in the Spirit<br />• Receiving fresh infillings of the Holy Spirit<br />• Getting direction through encounters with God<br /><br />Like Matt, you have been chosen for what God is doing in our day—when we will see a move of God’s spirit that overtakes whole cities.<br /><br />Matt says when you agree with the heart of God, He takes care of the rest. Your job is to shine!<br /><br />▶▶Empowered for Victory by Matt Cruz [5-CD Set]: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/34z9KMY">https://bit.ly/34z9KMY</a><br />▶▶Empowered for Victory by Matt Cruz [Digital Download]: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3I6rDk1">https://bit.ly/3I6rDk1</a><br /><br />ORDER THIS EPISODE ON DVD - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3Cyydyu">https://bit.ly/3Cyydyu</a><br />CLICK HERE TO START YOUR HEALING - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1Ml2jVc">http://bit.ly/1Ml2jVc</a><br />SUBSCRIBE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/10jKQtv">http://bit.ly/10jKQtv</a><br />DONATE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1cDCinQ">http://bit.ly/1cDCinQ</a><br />Join Our Mentoring Club! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1hwbPvh">http://bit.ly/1hwbPvh</a><br />FREE Newsletter! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1TXNkrM">http://bit.ly/1TXNkrM</a><br /><br />Copyright Sid Roth's It's Supernatural! 2022<br />#SidRoth #MattCruz #Destiny{% endraw %}
