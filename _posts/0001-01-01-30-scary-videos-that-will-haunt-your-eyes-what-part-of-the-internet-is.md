{% raw %}What part of the internet is more entertaining than the scary side? It doesn’t matter what sort of creepy content you enjoy, there are plenty of scary videos that are certain to appeal to you. With that said, if you are looking for a truly scary comp, then stop looking. The entries that I have analyzed in this list for you here, are some of the scariest videos you will find on the internet. Whether you prefer menacing ghost sightings, inexplicable haunted house mysteries, or creepy paranormal incidents that occurred in the darndest places, watching this list has got you covered! These are 30 scary videos that will haunt your eyes!<br /> <br />The internet has many eerie corners that are seen as the treasure chests of horror by the fans of the genre throughout the world. However, the wide majority of scary videos that you will chance upon on the web are, in fact, dreadfully mediocre. Even a good chunk of the scary stories — fictional or not — found on the internet are pretty weak. That said, rummaging through the spooky corners of the internet is worth it because you never know when you are going to stumble across a true horror gem! The entries in this list of top 30 scary videos are exactly that — the gems that I found through my countless hours of browsing the scary sides of the internet.<br /> <br />You will jump, you will scream, and you will surely realize that every single one of the scary videos on this list is pure nightmare fuel. What's more, if you can’t get enough of the creepy videos on this list, then you would definitely enjoy some of the other videos that I have made — have fun going down the rabbit hole of creepy videos that are going to seriously freak you out!<br /> <br />To all my viewers, I hereby propose a challenge. A lot of people claim to not believe in ghosts or the paranormal. If you or someone that you know claims the same, I challenge you to watch this list of 30 scary videos at 3 am! And if you can manage to make it all the way through to the end, you win. What I have seen and personally experienced is that even when people say they don't believe in ghosts or the paranormal, they still are afraid of the dark — which infers that the thought always lurks in the back of their minds that all the &quot;scary stuff&quot; could indeed be real. My challenge will reveal how well you do when the odds are stacked against you. Post your results in the comments!<br /> <br />In my opinion, I think most would not even make it past the first few creepy videos of this list. Because this scary comp contains videos that will give you one of the most teeth-chattering, fright-inducing, and sleep-with-a-nightlight-for-the-rest-of-your-life experiences. But, if you enjoy horror, this is your chance to turn up your speakers, turn off the lights, and settle in for a night of frights because it’s about to get very scary up in here!<br /> <br />So, if you are someone who loses their nerve without a hitch and easily gets the screaming heebie-jeebies, don't watch this list of creepy videos. Because it contains unsettlingly scary events — not some sudden movements or noise to induce a jump scare. So, proceed at your own peril.<br /> <br />Done watching? That's great!<br />Which of these scary videos frightened the living daylights out of you the most? Let me know right below in the comments!<br /><br />Sources:              <br />30.<br />dailystar.co.uk<br />29.<br />flamingbelladonna3/TikTok<br />28.<br />winirgta/TikTok<br />27.<br />ด้วยรัก และผูกพัน/Facebook<br />26.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/WxvdA2LpJ8g">https://youtu.be/WxvdA2LpJ8g</a><br />25.<br />elcucuy.tv/TikTok<br />24.<br />r/ChillsNarrator-Sailorgirl06<br />23.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/63hjE2C16Gc">https://youtu.be/63hjE2C16Gc</a><br />22.<br />mirror.co.uk<br />21.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/BhypaOgXuck">https://youtu.be/BhypaOgXuck</a><br />20.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/KpjyWgjQvmc">https://youtu.be/KpjyWgjQvmc</a><br />19.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DwxE2H-zqgQ">https://youtu.be/DwxE2H-zqgQ</a><br />18.<br />Kiraxes/Reddit<br />17.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wf0mLeGFaVk">https://youtu.be/wf0mLeGFaVk</a><br />16.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/C6KWR2B8IZ0">https://youtu.be/C6KWR2B8IZ0</a><br />15.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/4HwP3SH7zfY">https://youtu.be/4HwP3SH7zfY</a><br />14.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/YtO_FP4CKxw">https://youtu.be/YtO_FP4CKxw</a><br />13.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rrzWGt-bNyg">https://youtu.be/rrzWGt-bNyg</a><br />12.<br />bentaylorrr_/Reddit<br />11.<br />B4EvrUnknown54-Reddit<br />10.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wOlkW6-TOXc">https://youtu.be/wOlkW6-TOXc</a><br />9.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/cjVRycXORjI">https://youtu.be/cjVRycXORjI</a><br />8.<br />Jentheheb/Reddit<br />7.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/1EQbs0CRsPI">https://youtu.be/1EQbs0CRsPI</a><br />6.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ukp2km7vq8g">https://youtu.be/ukp2km7vq8g</a><br />5.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/n10w5lwtES4">https://youtu.be/n10w5lwtES4</a><br />4.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/7AESv0SBFUQ">https://youtu.be/7AESv0SBFUQ</a><br />3.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/e042HIE1nE">https://youtu.be/e042HIE1nE</a><br />2.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/8IY0BmJJM1Y">https://youtu.be/8IY0BmJJM1Y</a><br />1.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/97uzmSfgY6w">https://youtu.be/97uzmSfgY6w</a><br /> <br />Music:<br />Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br />jdgehlert (pond5.com)<br /><br />Entry Timestamps:<br />0:00  Intro<br />0:20 Number 30<br />1:30 Number 29<br />2:34 Number 28<br />3:09 Number 27<br />4:16 Number 26<br />5:35 Number 25<br />7:16 Number 24<br />7:57 Number 23<br />9:23 Number 22<br />10:13 Number 21<br />11:15 Number 20<br />13:18 Number 19<br />14:40 Number 18<br />16:03 Number 17<br />16:55 Number 16<br />18:29 Number 15<br />19:54 Number 14<br />20:59 Number 13<br />22:50 Number 12<br />25:17 Number 11<br />26:29 Number 10<br />27:53 Number 9<br />28:50 Number 8<br />30:07 Number 7<br />31:05 Number 6<br />32:24 Number 5<br />33:06 Number 4<br />34:19 Number 3<br />35:36 Number 2<br />36:29 Number 1{% endraw %}
