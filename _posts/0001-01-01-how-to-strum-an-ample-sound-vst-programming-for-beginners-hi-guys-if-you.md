{% raw %}Hi guys ! If you are a beginner in guitar programming, this video will show you how to strum an AmpleSound VST. We will program a simple pattern with a nice chord progression.<br /><br />As some of you asked me in the comments or in private message if I could do courses for beginners, I hope this one will help you to familiarize yourself with the strummer interface of your guitar VST. <br /><br />I'm going to use Ample Guitar Martin, but you can follow the course with the free guitar VST plugin AGML2 - or any other plugin designed by AmpleSound.<br /><br />To begin, we are going to use a very common chord progression in country and pop music : a B minor, a B minor 7, an A major and a G major.<br /><br />Then, we will design the strum pattern, adjust velocities to add emphasis and program chord switches in MIDI. <br /><br />I hope you will find the course clear, concise and useful. If you did, give it a thumbs upÂ ! <br /><br />Do not hesitate to leave a comment if you encounter any difficulties. <br /><br />Oh and here's the drum file if you want to practice with the playback : <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mega.nz/#F!mW4j1Yha!liLOLYPp2WqKvPDjdobcqw">https://mega.nz/#F!mW4j1Yha!liLOLYPp2WqKvPDjdobcqw</a><br /><br />Cheers !<br /><br />SUPPORT THE CHANNEL<br />===<br />Listen to my band here : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/zQBfsNdLjX4">https://youtu.be/zQBfsNdLjX4</a><br /><br />More at : yugen-music.com{% endraw %}
