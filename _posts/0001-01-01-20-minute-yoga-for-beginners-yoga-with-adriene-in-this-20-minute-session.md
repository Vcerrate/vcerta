{% raw %}In this 20-minute session for beginners, we will work with breath and other foundational elements to set you up for a sustainable and beneficial practice you enjoy! This is the perfect practice to send to a friend who wants to get into yoga. This is also designed as the perfect all-around practice for someone of any yoga background, with a meditative pace and strong focus on form and function to increase flexibility, build strength, and regulate the nervous system.<br /><br />Repeat this practice and commit to consistency to feel your mental, emotional, and physical health transform. <br /><br />You will move through breath work, poses for the spine, hips, shoulders, and core, as well as poses for the hamstrings, wrists, ankles, knees, and low back. <br /><br />Yoga is for everyone!
