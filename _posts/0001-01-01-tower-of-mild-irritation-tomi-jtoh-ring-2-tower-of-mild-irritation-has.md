{% raw %}Tower of Mild Irritation has released into Ring 2 as part of the February monthly challenges. The challenges this month are overall a lot more straightforward and simple due to it being a much shorter month. This is clearly reflected through the style of this tower, which is a classic-style tower with quite simple gameplay. However, there are definitely some spikes in difficulty for players who are near the skill level of this tower, hence the guide. Enjoy the video!<br /><br />Enjoying these videos?

This is a platformer-based game with many worlds to adventure through and conquer.<br />Here is a link to the game: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/2919924313/Jukes-Towers-of-Hell">https://www.roblox.com/games/2919924313/Jukes-Towers-of-Hell</a><br /><br />➽  About Ademiere:<br />Welcome everyone! Are you tired of JToH text commentary videos simply just trying to get the basic point across through incredibly sub-par commentary or even none at all? Well, my goal is to make the often-neglected staple of JToH content as relevant and interesting as possible. I try my best to improve something with each video to really make them stand out from the rest.{% endraw %}
