{% raw %}Let's take a look at Nature's Gift following the rework to Eithné and Freixenet. The changes make a huge difference in helping us survive against control heavy decks in 10.6. This deck feels extremely smooth to play, has great tempo and some control options. If you're looking to climb to pro this season, I definitely recommend giving this a try. In this video I discuss card selection, reasoning and strategy before playing 4 games with live commentary for reference.<br /><br />*If you want to support the channel and the content I make, the best way is to subscribe. <br />**Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDvxjEa8yz5FlQLwH5F05rQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDvxjEa8yz5FlQLwH5F05rQ/join</a><br />***I upload daily at 8am EDT.<br />For business inquiries, please contact Chris (email in bio).<br /><br />Intro/Deck Explanation: 0:00<br />Game 1: Scoia'tael Nature's Gift 15:27<br />Game 2: Skellige Ursine Ritual 26:28<br />Game 3: Scoia'tael Invigorate 37:27<br />Game 4: Northern Realms Pincer Maneuver 49:55<br /><br />Deck: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.playgwent.com/en/decks/guides/329980">https://www.playgwent.com/en/decks/guides/329980</a><br />Gwent Invite: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.playgwent.com/invite-a-friend/M33ABLDY3O">https://www.playgwent.com/invite-a-friend/M33ABLDY3O</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/qcento">https://www.patreon.com/qcento</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/qcento01">https://www.twitch.tv/qcento01</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/N2m8VpC">https://discord.gg/N2m8VpC</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/qcento01​​​​​​​">https://twitter.com/qcento01​​​​​​​</a><br />Team Legacy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teamlegacy.org​​​​">https://teamlegacy.org​​​​</a><br /><br />Rogue Energy<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rogueenergy.com/discount/QCENTO">https://rogueenergy.com/discount/QCENTO</a><br />Use code QCENTO at checkout for 10% off{% endraw %}
