{% raw %}David Goh is a SWA Grade 9 student. He has joined mathematics competitions since he was a young child. He had always felt fascinated seeing other students getting medals and awards but for a long time was hesitant about joining them himself. He started out joining competitions when he was 8 years old ended up earning his first medal. Following that, he joined national and international competitions several times. In the last competition he joined, he earned the champion trophy and won three gold medals. He realised that his passion was not something he was born with but a quality that developed and grew in him over time. He has been to three different countries to participate in math competitions, including America, India and Singapore. In his talk, he shares his experiences in mathematics competitions and developing passions with the world. David Goh is a SWA Grade 9 student. He has joined math competitions since he is a child.
