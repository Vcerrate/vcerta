{% raw %}Ukrainian troop back uses Harpoon Missile to sink Russian warships in Snake Island.<br /><br />Ukraine has started receiving Harpoon anti-ship missiles from Denmark and self-propelled howitzers from the United States. This weapon system employs subsonic, over-the-horizon sea-skimming missiles that can be tracked using radar. Submarines, planes, shore batteries, and ships can launch these missiles. The Harpoon missile can destroy large ships with a penetrating warhead of 2221 kilograms.{% endraw %}
