Since 2008, the Hartford, CT six-piece has independently sold over 100,000 singles, racked up more than 26 million streams on Spotify, and, with songs such as “Further On” and “Shake, Shake, Shake,” they have impressively notched nearly 100 high-profile placements ranging from the 2014 film St. Vincent, to commercials for Nissan and Starbucks, to numerous television shows. Along the way, their hyper-charged and hypnotic stage presence has turned bystanders into believers at festivals including Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, Hangout, and Firefly. <br /><br />Their new 10-track album, Light Me Up [DigSin], out October 16th, is posed to skyrocket them even further. Armed with a sound that’s one part indie dance party and another part roots rock laced with a pop sensibility, the music of Bronze Radio Return is begging to be blared with the windows rolled down. These boys stand primed for impact in a big way.<br /><br />About OurVinyl TV:<br />OurVinyl TV films live performances with both emerging and established musicians.

One big push is gonna get you there, takes a stronger eye to see them.<br /><br />When you see it in front of you, silhouette up ahead and you see where you're going to.<br /><br />Lead your way, sing your song. Moving every day, goin further on. Lead your way, keep on strong. Moving every day, goin further on.<br /><br />Break of day til the sun goes down, you work the time between them. A far off land to your own hometown, you've been all around to see them.<br /><br />When it's standing in front of you, and you take it and you pull it in, you see where you're going to.<br /><br />Lead your way, sing your song. Moving every day, goin further on. Lead your way, keep on strong. Moving every day, goin further on.{% endraw %}
