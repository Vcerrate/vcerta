{% raw %}Game companies are making the switch to a new type of plastic. Siocast is an injection molding thermoplastic that is viable for small and medium sized companies, and it offers some serious advantages over metal, resin, and pvc. We're going to be hearing a lot about this material! <br /><br />Thanks to the Siocast team for explaining this stuff to me, and even whipping up a special mold to demonstrate their process! Thanks to Loot Studios for the epic Goober Baron sculpt :-)<br /><br />More Goobertown<br />Patreon <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/GoobertownHobbies">https://www.patreon.com/GoobertownHobbies</a><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/goobertown_hobbies/">https://www.instagram.com/goobertown_hobbies/</a><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gtHobbies">https://twitter.com/gtHobbies</a><br />Paint Bravely The Podcast- on your podcast app and <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZN-qYkmCDfWfP4qYEtsB_w">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZN-qYkmCDfWfP4qYEtsB_w</a><br />The Twenty Sided Realms Podcast <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tsrpodcast.libsyn.com/tsrp-waterdeep-episode-1">https://tsrpodcast.libsyn.com/tsrp-waterdeep-episode-1</a><br /><br />I'd been hearing about Siocast and Siores for a little while, and I finally got sample models from a wide range of companies, and I got to see the casting process with a sioform live at a convention! The Siocast team even brought a mold that makes a mini brent!  Original sculpting of the Goober Baron was done by Loot Studios.<br /><br />Other sculpts in this video are from Broken Anvil, Creature Caster, Enigma, Level 52, Reaper, and Titan Forge.  Other notable companies like Corvus Belli are also making the switch to siocast! <br /><br />Small quantities of sample minis were provided to me free of charge by Siocast, Reaper, Broken anvil, and Titan Forge.{% endraw %}
