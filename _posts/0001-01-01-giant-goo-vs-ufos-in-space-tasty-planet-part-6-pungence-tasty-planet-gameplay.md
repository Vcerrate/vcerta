Instead it eats anything that it touches: dirt, bacteria, bugs, fish, mice, cats, dogs, cars, trees, houses, planets, galaxies... Everything!<br /><br />Levels<br />Munch your way through 60 levels and over 140 objects. Start as a microscopic entity in the laboratory and grow up to eat the city and more.<br /><br />Brand New Art<br />The original Tasty Planet has never looked so good. To celebrate its release on Steam, we've complete redone all the artwork. The classic artwork can be toggled in the game's settings.<br /><br />Controller Support<br />Keyboard and mouse controls are supported.<br />On Windows, most controllers will work.<br />On Mac, only PS3 and PS4 controllers are supported.<br /><br />Eat everything in the world with Tasty Planet.I hope you guys enjoyed this Tasty Planet Forever gameplay!
