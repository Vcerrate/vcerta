{% raw %}Torque converter adjustments to go faster on stock or stage 1 go kart and stock or stage 1 mini bike kits! I show a 30 series torque converter on a mini bike and a 20 series CVT on a go kart. The 40 series can be oriented the same way as either a 30 series or 40 series in many scenarios. Keep in mind the way the spring orientation is as pointed out in the video for the best performance.<br /><br />This quick mini bike performance mod can get you ahead of your buddy or up faster in the hole shot when racing. The video detailed a little with and without a stage 1 kit. The results are spaced further apart with less power. This torque converter is rated to a max HP about that of the stage 1 kits for performance. <br /><br />The torque converter is one of the best mini bike accessories and go kart staples for drive train out there today. The CVT is used highly in Snowmobiles, ATVs, go karts, mini bike AND MORE with a growing popularity.<br /><br />Why use the green spring? Well you want to get up and go a little faster and get a higher top speed. Why would ANYONE go with a yellow spring? The cheap chinese torque converters have a low HP rating compared to Comet torque converters. These springs are comet springs, and usable in the cheaper torque converters. The reason you would want the yellow springs is if you have even greater horsepower you don't want to jam up your belts or skip them. The tighter yellow spring can help prevent skipping belts with higher horse power.{% endraw %}
