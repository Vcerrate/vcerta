{% raw %}How to make your woman feel heard and understood to grow passion and intimacy.<br /><br />In this video coaching newsletter I discuss an email from a viewer who writes in asking if his fiancé is a bad partner after they had a disagreement. She is a musician and asked him for his opinion on a song of hers. He wasn’t very supportive of her song and this obviously hurt her feelings. Then he proceeded to stonewall her attempts to communicate and he tried to go to bed without resolving their differences. The opposite of what my book, 3% Man, teaches. He asks my opinion. This email is a great example of what not to do to make your woman feel heard and understood.<br /><br />Click the link below to read the article “How To Make Your Woman Feel Heard &amp; Understood” on my website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://understandingrelationships.com/how-to-make-your-woman-feel-heard-understood/72904">https://understandingrelationships.com/how-to-make-your-woman-feel-heard-understood/72904</a><br /><br />If you have not read my book, “How To Be A 3% Man” yet, that would be a good starting place for you.
