{% raw %}Back to the Future is one of the great movies of the 1980s, and its sequels continued its story in fine fashion. It's frequently cited as a favorite film, and for good reason â€” the more you focus on the way these films are put together, the more you realize how thoughtful every filmmaking decision was. BTTF frequently makes allusions to outside events, and it likes to sneakily reveal future narrative events long before they occur. Issues like nostalgia and abuse are handled with great care and thoughtfulness, and you can't help but admire the film the more for this. These are thing you only nice in Back to the Future after watching it more than once.<br /><br />#BackToTheFuture #Movies #BTTF<br /><br />Plenty of foreshadowing | 0:00<br />Sequel bait | 1:02<br />Safety Last! | 2:07<br />A timeless slogan | 3:02<br />The good old days? | 4:01<br />Just like in the movies | 5:08<br />Tardy Marty | 6:18<br />Precision lightning | 7:09<br />Like father, like son | 8:06<br />Not ready for that yet | 9:15<br />Book-lover bonus | 10:09<br /><br />Read Full Article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.looper.com/399546/things-you-only-notice-in-back-to-the-future-after-watching-it-more-than-once/">https://www.looper.com/399546/things-you-only-notice-in-back-to-the-future-after-watching-it-more-than-once/</a>{% endraw %}
