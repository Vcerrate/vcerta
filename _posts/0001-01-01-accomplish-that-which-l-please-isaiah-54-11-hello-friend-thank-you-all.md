{% raw %}Hello friend thank you all for checking out this video today I'm inspirited <br />by this beautiful scripture from Isaiah 54:11, it encourages us that there is power in our tongue whatever we declare in and over our lives, it shall not retune to us void but accomplish that which is desired for every mountain that stands in our way we have the power within us to move it amen{% endraw %}
