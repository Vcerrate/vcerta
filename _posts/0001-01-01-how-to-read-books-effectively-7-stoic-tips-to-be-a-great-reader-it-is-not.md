{% raw %}To be a great reader, it is not enough that you read, it‚Äôs how you read.<br /><br />It‚Äôs not about reading to impress people or for the mental gymnastics. It‚Äôs not about pouring inputs into your brain. It‚Äôs about getting better! It‚Äôs about filtering what gets into your brain. It‚Äôs about finding useful knowledge, knowledge you can use in your actual life. It‚Äôs about putting the information up to the test, examining it, seeing how it applies to your life, asking yourself how you might use it, what it‚Äôs prompting you to think.<br /><br />If you want to become a great reader, the Stoics can help. We built out their best insights into our Read to Lead: A Daily Stoic Reading Challenge. The 2022 live course will take place across 5 weeks at a pace of 2 emails a week (~30,000 words of exclusive content).<br /><br />Additionally, there will be weekly LIVE video sessions with Ryan Holiday, author of 12 books about Stoic philosophy which have sold more than 5 million copies in over 30 languages. <br /><br />This will be a live course. Beginning on TUESDAY MAY 17, all participants will move through the course together at the same pace.<br /><br />üìö Registration is now officially open at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dailystoic.com/reading">https://dailystoic.com/reading</a><br /><br />‚úâÔ∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dailystoic.com/dailyemail">https://dailystoic.com/dailyemail</a><br /><br />00:00 Intro<br />01:17 1.
