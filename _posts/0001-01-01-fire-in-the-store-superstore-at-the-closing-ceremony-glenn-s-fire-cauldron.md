Their fellow associates include the sardonic Garrett (Colton Dunn), the sweet and clueless Cheyenne (Nichole Bloom), and the perpetually dismissed Sandra (Kaliko Kauahi). Also on the team are Glenn (Mark McKinney), who stepped down as manager in an attempt to have more family time, and Dina (Lauren Ash), the aggressive assistant manager who enforces Cloud 9 policy with an iron fist. Mateo (Nico Santos) was also part of the team, most recently as the self-promoted floor supervisor, until being detained due to his undocumented status.<br /><br />Superstore is available now on Peacock, the new streaming service from NBCUniversal.
