{% raw %}Evening workouts that are quick but effective are so clutch. Especially when you really wanted to get that workout in during the day, but didn't find the time. <br /><br />This workout is your chance to smile, vibe, let your dinner digest (try to do it about 1hr after dinner), and get ready for an amazing sleep!<br /><br />I find that if I workout about an hour after my dinner and an hour (or two) before bed time, I feel the best and I sleep the best.<br /><br />This quick HIIT will get your heart rate up, and will help you get into the fat burning zone before your day ends.<br /><br />Make sure to keep breathing throughout and take your time with it!<br /><br />Share with two friends if you enjoy this workout, and have a great night!<br /><br />ps- if you have trouble sleeping, make sure to check out the Sleep Sounds in my growwithjo app!
