{% raw %}BRILLIANT CLEANING TRICKS AND HACKS THAT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE<br /><br /><br /><br />In this video, I show you some brilliant tricks and ideas that will help you in your daily routine. <br /><br />To avoid the annoying toilet splash, simply add a piece of toilet roll on the surface of the water. <br /><br />You can use disposable seat covers to get rid of sweat and greasiness on your face. <br /><br />To make your toilet seat warmer, you can dress it with a pair of socks, which you can remove at the end of the day and wash. <br /><br />To unclog your toilet simply cover it with some cling-film and make sure no air can escape. After that, flush the toilet and push it down with your hands.  It will unclog in no time. <br /><br />You can pour some essential oil on the sides of your toilet roll to make the bathroom smell nice. <br /><br />Watch until the end to find out how to thoroughly wash your hands, remove gloves and mask to get rid of germs and avoid spreading them.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Timestamps:<br /><br />0:46 – How to warm up the toilet seat<br /><br />1:58 – How to stop your cat from taking the toilet roll<br /><br />2:52 – How to remove mask and gloves<br /><br />4:06 – Why you should apply fabric softener in your toilet <br /><br />5:43 – Cool toilet seat reminder<br /><br />6:56 – Why you should put an aspirin in your toilet<br /><br />8:32 – How to save water<br /><br />10:41 – What to do when you don’t have toilet paper <br /><br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
