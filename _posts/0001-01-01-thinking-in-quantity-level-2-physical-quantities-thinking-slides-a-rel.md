Two examples are included in the video and two additional examples are included in the linked thinking slides.  <br /><br />TERMS<br />Physical quantities - the properties of a material or system that can be measured<br />Standard units<br />- Weight - quantity of matter in an object (kg)<br />- Time - an irreversible series of events (s)<br />- Temperature - the degree of heat present in a substance (°C)<br />- Volume - amount of space an object occupies (L)<br /><br />This progression is based on the Crosscutting Concept elements from the NRC document A Framework for K-12 Science Education.  “Standard units are used to measure and describe physical quantities such as weight, time, temperature, and volume.” <br />Source:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nextgenscience.org/">https://www.nextgenscience.org/</a>{% endraw %}
