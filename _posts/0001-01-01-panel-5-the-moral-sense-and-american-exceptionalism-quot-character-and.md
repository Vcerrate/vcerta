{% raw %}&quot;Character and the Moral Sense: James Q. Wilson and the Future of Public Policy&quot; was held on Feb 28-Mar 1, 2014 at the Pepperdine University  School of Public Policy. <br /><br />About this panel: James Q. Wilson's final project at Pepperdine was the design of a course sharing the title of his book, jointly edited with Peter Schuck,  Understanding America: The Anatomy of an Exceptional Nation. Although the course was to be taught by a four-faculty team, Wilson was not able to cover the final section as he had planned. His three fellow faculty members from that course at Pepperdine comprise this panel, addressing the many dimensions, moral and otherwise, of Wilson's &quot;exceptional nation.&quot; <br /><br />Speakers:       Chair: Colleen Graffy, Director of Global Programs and Associate Professor of Law,London Program, Pepperdine University; Victor Davis Hanson, Martin and Illie Anderson Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution, Stanford University; William E. Simon Distinguished Visiting Professor, School of Public Policy, Pepperdine University; Robert Kaufman, Professor of Public Policy, Pepperdine University; James Piereson, President, William E.
