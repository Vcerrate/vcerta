{% raw %}Japji Sahib English Explanation Katha of 31st Pauri<br /><br />This video focuses on the 31st Pauri of Sri Jap Ji Sahib where Guru Nanak Sahib states &quot;Aasan Loe Loe Bhandaar, Jo Kich Paaea Su Eka Vaar, &quot;. We examine the idea that God is everywhere and in all things and yet most of us cannot see this. We look at how many of us discriminate between people and also impose our view on where God should be. on the world, rather than accept this truth. We also look at how Vaheguru provides everything for us especially those things that are essential. We see that although humans must work for food, this is actually a blessing upon us and that the world and the game made by Vaheguru is not false, rather its true and we should play it. <br /><br />We sing Vaheguru Simran and kirtan of &quot;Meharvaan, Sahib Meharvaan&quot; by Guru Arjan Patshah. The kirtan was done by Bhai Harbhajan Singh from Southall. <br />--------<br />With Guru's blessings, the SIKHI in English series will be going through the entire Sri Jap Ji Sahib, (the very first Bani in Sri Guru Granth Sahib) and trying understand it in English alongside singing Gurbani kirtan to help explain further.<br /><br />The programme is held every Sunday from 6-7:15pm at Park Avenue Gurdwara, Southall. English katha alongside kirtan and simran by local kirtanees. Please give us your darshan and sangat.
