{% raw %}Here's my latest writing prompt<br /><br />Transcript:<br />Tell this story. You’re going on a walk one day when you discover a smartphone for pets with a secret suite of apps that dogs and cats use when humans aren’t around. <br /><br />Consider their map app.What key locations do they have within a typical neighborhood? Think of significant sights, smells, and sounds this app would highlight. What shortcuts would it recommend? What dangers would it warn others about?   <br />What kinds of video apps does it have? <br />What shows would they binge-watch? <br />Perhaps Barking Bad or the Great British Bark-Off? <br />What happens when they press paws?<br />Does the phone have photo sharing apps? <br />What types of pictures do the pets take? <br />What paw-dcasts do the pets listen to?   <br />Do they have a music app? <br />If so, what songs do they listen to?  <br />What audiobooks do they listen to? <br />What types of food apps do they have? <br />What do they buy? <br />Maybe a catpaccino or a pupcake?  <br />What kinds of social media do they have? <br />What do they share? <br />And how do they chat without written language?<br />What kinds of games do they have? <br />What specialty apps <br />do they have that no human would need? <br />Meow after thinking through the scenario, write the story using vivid imagery and description.{% endraw %}
