LawShelf is a project of National Paralegal College <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nationalparalegal.edu.">https://nationalparalegal.edu.</a><br /><br />Module three focuses on the important “distinctiveness” requirement for trademark protection. We will look at the differences among descriptive, suggestive, arbitrary and fanciful marks. The module also covers cases that illustrate the nuances of the series of rules and how distinctiveness can be acquired or lost depending on how the marks are used in the context in which they are used.<br /><br />National Paralegal College offers undergraduate programs leading to a paralegal certificate, paralegal associate’s degree, bachelor’s degree in legal studies, bachelor’s degree in business administration, or joint program in legal and business studies. In addition, the graduate division of NPC offers a Master of Science in Legal Studies, a Master of Science in Compliance Law, and a Master of Science in Taxation.
