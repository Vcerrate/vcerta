{% raw %}THIS VIDEO WILL SPOIL THE ENTIRE GAME. Inscryption is best played knowing as little as possible about it beforehand so I definitely recommend playing it before watching this video. It's personally my game of the year and I promise that it's worth every single penny. Go! Go play it!<br /><br />This game means a lot to me, (I don't know the last time a piece of media hit me this hard) and I really hope that it shows in this video! Enjoy!<br /><br />If you like my videos then maybe you'll like my webcomic ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tapas.io/series/Going-home">https://tapas.io/series/Going-home</a><br /><br />My Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Najsigt">https://www.patreon.com/Najsigt</a><br />My Tumblr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://najsigt.tumblr.com/">https://najsigt.tumblr.com/</a><br />My Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/najsigt_art/">https://www.instagram.com/najsigt_art/</a><br />My twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Najsigt_Art">https://twitter.com/Najsigt_Art</a>{% endraw %}
