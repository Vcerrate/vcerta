{% raw %}What's the difference between the Down Force map and Applied Down Force map on the Precision Planting 20|20 monitor? <br /><br />The Applied Down Force map is used to evaluate field and planter conditions, not DeltaForce performance. <br /><br />DeltaForce is an automated row by row downforce control system that measures and adjusts downforce every time there is variability in your field, so your crops will thrive for optimal yields. <br />» <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.precisionplanting.com/products/product/deltaforce">https://www.precisionplanting.com/products/product/deltaforce</a>{% endraw %}
