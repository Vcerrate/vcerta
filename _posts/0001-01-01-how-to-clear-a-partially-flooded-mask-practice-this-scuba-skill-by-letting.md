{% raw %}Practice this scuba skill by letting some water in your mask, you will achieve this by breaking the seal of the mask around the face. Next, hold the top of the mask against your forehead; hold the frame of the mask, not the skirt of the mask. Look up slightly, normally at approximately 45 degrees while exhaling through the nose.{% endraw %}
