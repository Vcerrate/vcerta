{% raw %}Federico Caligaris-Cappio, MD of Università Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy, talks about new treatment and traditional treatment options for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) at the 2016 International Workshop of the German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG) in Cologne, Germany. Prof. Caligaris-Cappio explains that whenever there are new drugs, there is a huge temptation to jump to these drugs and forget about the rest. He believes that doctors must think about the particular patient in these situations. All the aspects of the patient, their fears and expectations, must be taken into consideration and weighed up to decide which treatment is best for them, old or new. He explains that for the patient it doesn’t matter what type of treatment they undergo as long as it helps them.{% endraw %}
