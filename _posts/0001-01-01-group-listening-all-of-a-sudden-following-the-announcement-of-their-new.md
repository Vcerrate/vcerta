{% raw %}Following the announcement of their new album - Clarinet &amp; Piano: Selected Works, Vol. 2 - Group Listening release a reinterpretation of one of Laraaji's more beautiful new age pop moments 'All of a Sudden' - accompanied by a video by Nic Finch (chameleonic): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ffm.to/grouplistening">http://ffm.to/grouplistening</a><br /><br />Featuring helmet sculptures by H.

It featured rearranged tracks by the likes of Arthur Russell, Brian Eno and Robert Wyatt. But it was also much more than that.
