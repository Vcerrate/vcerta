{% raw %}CNBC Today On Melvin Capital Unwinding, GME Stock &amp; AMC Stock || GME Update<br /><br />Hosts of CNBC Squawk On The Street had a conversation today about Melvin Capital unwinding its fund and returning what capital is left to investors. This comes after the fund lost billions of dollars, most notably from shorting two of individual retail investors' favorite stocks - AMC stock &amp; GME stock. Melvin Capital owner Gabe Plotkin will reportedly walk away from the unwinding of the fund just fine financially, and face no legal action as far as we know. If an individual retail investor were in the same position, that person would likely incur severe scrutiny from regulators, and possibly be charged for posing a risk to the stock market. This information is important for retail investors who have rallied behind AMC stock &amp; GME stock in order to rescue AMC and GameStop from the brink of bankruptcy due to malicious short selling. This information is also important for the entire stock market as individual retail investors continue to stand up for a free, fair, and transparent stock market for all investors.<br /><br />Get FREE Stock When You Sign Up With Public:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://share.public.com/FinVid">https://share.public.com/FinVid</a><br /><br />ATTENTION: For all business inquires please email finvid.business@gmail.com<br />(Please note that we will NEVER accept payment to talk about any particular stocks on this channel.)<br /><br />LEGAL DISCLAIMER: This video is for entertainment purposes ONLY.
