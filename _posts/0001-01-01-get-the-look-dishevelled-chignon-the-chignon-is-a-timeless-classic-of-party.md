{% raw %}The chignon is a timeless classic of party hair, especially when youâ€™re looking for an easy but still sophisticated and stylish updo.  It can be tailored to suit just about any face shape, by adjusting the detail around your face and the texture of the bun itself.<br />The stunningly beautiful Chrissy Teigen is a firm fan of the chignon, as seen here styled by Snowden Hill using Cloud Nine Wands. <br /><br />Our Style Ambassador Stacey McCormack shows you how to perfect the look, with the help of the Cloud Nine Curling Wand and Airshot{% endraw %}
