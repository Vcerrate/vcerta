It will show case the power of small steps and how it can change your whole life. <br /><br />Take your wealth for example, you want to get your first million dollars. This may seem so big at first. But if you simply take the small steps to work a few extra hours a day or learn a key skill like investing. for example if you started investing just $200 a month into an index fund like the S&amp;P 500 which  has returned an average return of around 10%  a year. 40 Years later you will have achieved your first million. See how small steps lead to big results in the long run.<br /><br />00:00 Book 2: <br /><br />How do you guys look at a NO. When you got rejected from a job or a NO from your crush. Do you simply give up and think your life is over? if that's the case then the next book is perfect for you. It will show you the power of NO and how you can start converting the NO‚Äôs into a Yes. <br />Elon musk‚Äôs has his first 2 SpaceX rockets blown up and was on the verge of bankruptcy,  All the odds were against him but he didn't give up and now SpaceX is the first private company to launch humans into orbit. <br /><br />00:00 Book 3: <br /><br />Do you find it hard to win friends or influence people in a positive way then this book is the one. Imagine having the power to make people do what you want. That's crazy!<br />On a serious note, No matter what you do in this world you will always have to deal with people. Its one of the most essential skill that we as humans need in order to succeed in our professional and personal life. <br /><br />00:00 Book 4: <br /><br />We all constantly have changes going around in our life's for example, moving schools, work places, new relationships or it could even be a marriage. These changes have huge impacts in our life's and sometimes it may be hard for us to adapt. Especially for teenagers transitioning into becoming adults cause I know it was tough for me. I didn't know how to act or behave, it happened so quick. <br /><br />The book sounds a bit cheesy and foolish but it is very impactful. it is a small book so am sure you will be able to finish it in a day. But make sure you really understand it.<br /><br />00:00 Book 5:<br /><br />The power of your thoughts are very powerful and we overlook that sometimes and this book will really open up your mind about what you should and shouldn't fill up in your brain as it will effect your subconscious mind in a major way. <br /><br />Here's a simple example, Do you remember the times you couldn't wake up early in the morning for school. This was cause you told your brain school was annoying and boring.  Now imagine if you thought your school was magical and the best thing ever. you would love going to school and instantly wake up in the morning without any effort. Try doing this from today and you wont have to listen to this ever morning.<br /><br />00:00 Book 6 : <br /><br />Have you ever wondered, HOW do rich people stay rich while the Poor stay poor with increasing debt. Well its simple the poor aren't taught how to make money using their money whereas the rich are taught to invest majority of their money to make more money. <br /><br />00:00 Book 7 : <br /><br />We as humans are taught the same things over and over again through our ancestors to parents. We are programmed to operate how our parents were taught, but think about it if you want to do something different you need to break the chain. We cannot do the same things as what our parents do to expect different results when it comes to wealth. This point is well defined in this Book.  Which will give you an insight on how Rich people think and differ from poor peoples mindset.<br /><br />________________________________________________<br />BE MY FRIEND:<br />üì∏ IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jatznaran/‚Äã">https://www.instagram.com/jatznaran/‚Äã</a><br />üéµ TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jatz.naran‚Äã">https://www.tiktok.com/@jatz.naran‚Äã</a><br /><br />CONTACT:<br />For business inquires only, please use this email: team@jnaran.co.uk<br />________________________________________________<br />AFFILIATE DISCLOSURE: <br />there may be a few links in this description that, at no cost to you, will earn me a commission if you choose to click them and make a purchase üôÇ<br />Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì I only ever promote things that have genuinely helped me.{% endraw %}
