{% raw %}What is a general clean? (Also known as a maintenance clean.) When you do the walkthrough it's important to clarify with the client if you're doing a deep clean or a general clean. This way you can meet customer expectations. <br /><br />A general clean can apply to DIY cleaning or #cleaning done by maids. <br /><br />You can break maintenance cleaning into chunks and follow a routine so the house is clean often.<br /><br />Today's #AskaHouseCleaner sponsors are Savvy Cleaner Training (and producer of these cleaning videos.) And My Cleaning Connection - a resource hub for all things cleaning. <br />#Angela Brown<br /><br />*** RATE THIS SHOW *** <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sotellus.com/r/savvy-cleaner">https://sotellus.com/r/savvy-cleaner</a><br /><br />*** RATE THIS PODCAST *** <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ratethispodcast.com/askahousecleaner">https://ratethispodcast.com/askahousecleaner</a><br /><br />*** FAST TRACK TO CLEANING SUCCESS ***<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://SavvyCleaner.com/Calendar-of-Courses">https://SavvyCleaner.com/Calendar-of-Courses</a><br /><br />*** MOST REQUESTED LIST OF CLEANING STUFF I USE ***<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.Amazon.com/shop/AngelaBrown">https://www.Amazon.com/shop/AngelaBrown</a> <br /><br />*** MORE VIDEOS ON THIS TOPIC ***<br />Spring Cleaning Blueprint - Routines to Make Cleaning Easier! - Clean My Space - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/4IsRzWNqcKk">https://youtu.be/4IsRzWNqcKk</a><br /><br />WHOLE HOUSE GENERAL CLEANING | Christiana Collings - Christiana Collings - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/FQ35qkm0rTk">https://youtu.be/FQ35qkm0rTk</a><br /><br />Spring Cleaning My Bathroom- Dulce Candy - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/dpBDNmhCXrQ">https://youtu.be/dpBDNmhCXrQ</a><br /><br />Extreme Spring Cleaning Motivation - Brianna K - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/NdgDno6sViY">https://youtu.be/NdgDno6sViY</a><br /><br />Learn to Clean - House Cleaning 101 - Angela Brown - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/LHxsRIxwTrQ">https://youtu.be/LHxsRIxwTrQ</a><br /><br /><br />*** GOOD KARMA RESOURCES FROM THIS EPISODE ***<br />These good karma links connect you to Amazon.com and affiliated sites that offer products or services that relate to today’s show. <br />When you click on the links and buy the items you pay the exact same prices or less than if you found the links on your own elsewhere.
