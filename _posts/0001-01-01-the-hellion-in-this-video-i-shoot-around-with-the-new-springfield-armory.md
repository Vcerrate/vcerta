{% raw %}In this video, I shoot around with the new Springfield Armory Hellion bullpup rifle. It's based off the VHS-2 by HS Produkt. Correction from what I said on video, the VHS is a Croatian made firearm, not French although the French used it in trials. Sorry for the mix up. That aside, this Hellion is the semi automatic version packing a 16 inch 5.56 barrel with 1/7 twist, it's fully ambidextrous, has awesome flip up sights with peepholes ranging from 0-500 yards, adjustable gas system, adjustable stock, QD sling points, and many other features I dive into in this video. On top sits a Nightforce NX8 1-8X24 FFP scope. What an awesome combo this ended up being especially suppressed with my OOS HX-QD 5.56 Ti. What do y'all think about it?{% endraw %}
