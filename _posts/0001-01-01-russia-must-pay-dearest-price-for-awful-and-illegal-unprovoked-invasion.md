{% raw %}Prime Minister Scott Morrison has spoken to Ukraine’s Prime Minister and President, saying they were “deeply grateful” for the support Australia has provided amid the Russian invasion. <br /><br />Mr Morrison said he will have a “bit more to say” in the next few days on additional support to be provided by the Australian government to Ukraine.  <br /><br />“The people of Ukraine have shown, and their government and their leadership and President Zelensky have shown enormous grit and courage, and they're an inspiration, and this is the second conversation I've had with the Prime Minister,” he said.  <br /><br />“This is just an awful and illegal, unprovoked invasion by Russia into the Ukraine and we must ensure that Russia pays the dearest price for doing this. <br /><br />“Not just to ensure justice for the Ukrainian people, but to ward off any others who want to go down that autocratic path and seek to threaten and coerce their neighbours.”{% endraw %}
