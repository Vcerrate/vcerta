This is the newest keyboard from Glorious, focusing on the improvement of the GMMK 1. This budget mechanical keyboard is full of quality, featuring hotswappable north facing sockets, RGB LEDs, side lighting, kickstand feet, doubleshot ABS keycaps, and uses the all new Glorious Fox Switches. The Glorious Fox Switches are linear switches that are factory lubed and have a transparent housing, which is similar to Zeal Tealios, Everglide Aqua King switches, and Durock L2 switches aka tealios copies. The transparent housing allows the keyboard to shine extremely bright when LEDs are on and at night. It's available in pink, black, and white, which is quite similar to Razer keyboards. The build quality of the keyboard is nice with the anodized aluminum top plate frame and the keycaps are pretty good. They have regular thickness so they won't be extra thocky. But they are shinethrough so it's extremely well fit for this keyboard. The keyboard also sports a low profile case, meaning the switch tops are exposed, making RGB spread look better as well make it easier to clean compared to a high profile case. Throughout my testing, the heft of the keyboard made it feel premium. The sound of the switches were pretty decent. The only thing that needs work are the plate mount stabilizers. Glorious should put their GSV2 screw-in stablizers as the default instead of the plate stabs because they sound extremely inconsistent.<br /><br />#glorious #GMMK2 #GloriousFoxSwitches{% endraw %}
