This will help you determine what type of chimney rod material would best suit your run. Fiberglass chimney rods are the least flexible making them best for a straight chimney run, where nylon and poly chimney rods are going to be more flexible allowing you to go through 45 and 90 degree bends. One other thing you will want to consider is the connecting end of your brush as you will want to choose chimney rods that are compatible or there are also adapters to convert from one style connecting end to another. <br /><br />Click Here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/k3bhktz">http://tinyurl.com/k3bhktz</a> to learn more about the chimney rods and adapters that are offered by NorthlineExpress.com.{% endraw %}
