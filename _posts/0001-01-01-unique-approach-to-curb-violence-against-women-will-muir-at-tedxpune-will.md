{% raw %}Will Muir grew up in England where, after a long career in Strategy Consulting and Business Administration in London, founded Equal Community Foundation (ECF) in Pune in 2009. ECF provides every man in India the opportunity to study and practice gender equitable behavior so that, violence against women can be ended once and for all.&quot;<br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
