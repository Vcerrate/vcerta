{% raw %}Imran Khan demands immediate elections. Pakistan's former PM addressing a huge roaring crowd of supporters in Karachi demanded immediate general elections in the country. He described PM Shahbaz Sharif as &quot;Mir Jaffar&quot; and raised difficult questions like who was being addressed by the American State Dept to remove him. But he emphasised that he is not Anti-American or Anti-Europe or Anti-India, though he seeks a self-respecting relation with all powers. He also descried that men on bail becoming PM and CM is a huge challenge for Pakistan's justice system which he thought was on trial. While he has generated huge popularity on the streets, will that produce sufficient pressure upon the system to agree on an early elections is a big question. <br /><br />Moeed Pirzada, Editor Global Village Space, is a prominent TV Anchor and strategic Analyst.
