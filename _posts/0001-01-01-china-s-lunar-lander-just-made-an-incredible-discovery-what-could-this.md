Could this incredible discovery be a sign of ancient Moon life? <br /><br />We live on an ocean world in a Solar System teeming with planets and moons.  The most up-to-date NASA census shows 8 planets, 5 dwarf planets, and over 200 moonsâ€”and for good measure, throw in a million-plus asteroids and almost 4,000 comets.<br /><br />Now consider that TWOâ€¦ of the THREE most common elements in our universe are hydrogen and oxygen.  <br /><br />Is it surprising that astronomers believe that our cosmic backyard is not the dry and barren wasteland once thought?  Now, science has the first real time on-site detection of evidence of water on our Moonâ€™s surface, and any remaining ideas of a bone-dry satellite are gone.<br /><br />Welcome to Factnomenal!  In todayâ€™s video we dive deep into the celestial pond that is our neighborhood and look at the historic find by Chinaâ€™s lunar lander.  <br /><br />What could this mean for manned missions to the Moon, or even more so...<br /><br />Beyond it? <br /><br /><br /><br />Buy us a coffee to show your support!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Factnomenal">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Factnomenal</a>  <br /><br />DON'T CLICK THIS LINK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/357shs3j">https://tinyurl.com/357shs3j</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching Factnomenal!<br />ðŸŒŽ Subscribe for more space discoveries, space facts, and space in general!<br />ðŸ”” Hit the bell next to subscribe so you never miss a video!<br /><br /><br />â–º For copyright matters, make sure to send us an email to Adam@trustedmiddle.com<br /><br />#space #factnomenal #discovery{% endraw %}
