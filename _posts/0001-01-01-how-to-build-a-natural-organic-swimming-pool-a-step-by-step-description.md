{% raw %}A step by step description on how we build our own natural pool in the garden.<br />Update.<br />A few people have asked about price and work load.  I think the total cost landed close to 40k USD. It took 1Â½ year, but that includes some no-work periods because of waiting time for material (COVID!!) and we waited 3 months for the liner guy to begin his work. The 2 biggest single costs were the liner and the material for the wood decking.<br />Update.<br />A few words about filtration rate. As mentioned if you build a tecnical wetland setup your filtration rate can not be too high because the plant roots needs time to filter nutrients out of the water. According to the books I used the rate should not be more than 30cm/hour. That equals 300 liters of water/m2. My total water surface is approx. 85m2. But the vertical speed of water is higher in the filtration zone because the filter material is taking up much of the space. So I halfed the surface area for the calculation. That gives me a max. filtration rate of 42m2 x 300 liter/hour = 12.600 liters/hour. This being the maximum filtration rate, I desided to go for 6.000 liter/hour to give the plant roots more time for filtration. So far it seems to work :-){% endraw %}
