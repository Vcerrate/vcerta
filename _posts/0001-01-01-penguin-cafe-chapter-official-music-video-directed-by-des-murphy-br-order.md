{% raw %}Directed by Des Murphy<br />Order new album 'Handfuls of Night' on LP/CD/DL: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://idol.lnk.to/HandfulsofNight">https://idol.lnk.to/HandfulsofNight</a><br /><br />Penguin Cafe have revealed the video for their new single 'Chapter', taken from the highly anticipated new album 'Handfuls of Night', released on October 4 via Erased Tapes. <br /><br />The captivating single-shot video for was filmed in New York on The Roosevelt Island Tramway at Queensboro Bridge and directed by Des Murphy. The use of a city that occupies such a massive part of our cultural imagination, particularly on the silver screen, highlights the track’s vivid filmic feel, as does its inspired adoption of noir tones.<br /><br />“Chapter is for me one of the big tracks on the album. We got into this mindset where we were creating cinematic story lines for our imaginary penguin protagonists – and this one was a lot of fun to make. There's a hint of 70's cop-show about the main motif with the double push in the bass line and we got this idea of a hard-boiled detective-penguin, with a leather jacket and a cool car in New York. The video totally goes with that feel. I love the idea of a familiar landscape being gradually moved into an imaginary, almost dreamlike version of itself – and the slow build in the video hit this exact note.” — Arthur Jeffes<br /><br />'Chapter' is the second piece to be take from Handfuls of Night, the highly anticipated follow-up to Penguin Cafe’s much applauded 2017 album The Imperfect Sea. Released on October 4, this glacial new LP is inspired by Arthur Jeffes’ journey following in the legendary explorer Scott’s footsteps, the Antarctic and our penguin friends that reside there. <br /><br />Penguin Cafe are taking Handfuls of Night around the UK and Japan this autumn before heading out on a worldwide tour in 2020, with more dates to be announced very soon.<br /><br />Book tickets for the tour: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.penguincafe.com/tour-dates">https://www.penguincafe.com/tour-dates</a>{% endraw %}
