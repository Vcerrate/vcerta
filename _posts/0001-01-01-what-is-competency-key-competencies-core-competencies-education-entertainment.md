{% raw %}what is competency? Competency is the ability to do any task successfully or efficiently. Key Competencies: Teamwork, Initiative, Responsibility Commitment to career Commercial awareness Career motivation Decision making Communication, Leadership, Trustworthiness &amp; Ethics, Results orientation Problem solving, IT skills.<br />What does your company do better than anyone else? In the short run, a companyâ€™s competitiveness derives from the performance attributes of current products. Competitiveness derives from an ability to build, at lower cost and more speedily than competitors, the core competencies that spawn unanticipated products. Core competencies are the collective learning in the organization, especially how to coordinate diverse production skills and integrate multiple streams of technologies. Unlike physical assets, which deteriorate over time, core competencies are enhanced as they are applied and shared. But competencies still need to be nurtured and protected; knowledge fades if it is not used. Competencies are the glue that binds existing businesses. They are also the engine for new business development.<br />Thanks for watching my video #altafmukati #learningvideos #education&amp;entertainment<br /><br />What is Competency <br />What are Key Competencies <br />Education Terminology<br />Story of Competency Building, Leadership, and Teamwork<br />The Explainer: Finding Your Company's Core Competencies<br />Business Strategy - Core Competencies<br />#alevelbusiness<br />#keycompetencies<br />#corecompetencies<br /><br />CREDIT<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.freepik.com">http://www.freepik.com</a><br /><br />Please subscribe my YouTube Channel by CLICKING the following LINK: <br />shorturl.at/oswE9 <br /><br />My Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sites.google.com/view/education-entertainment/home">https://sites.google.com/view/education-entertainment/home</a><br /><br />Please check my YouTube playlists at:<br />shorturl.at/hksvR<br />shorturl.at/kQ348<br />My FACEBOOK Page: www.facebook.com/altafmukati<br />My LINKEDIN Site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prof-dr-altaf-mukati-b090224/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/prof-dr-altaf-mukati-b090224/</a><br />My TWITTER Site: twitter.com/altafmukati<br />My TUMBLR Site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/altafmukati">https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/altafmukati</a><br />My Blogs at WORDPRESS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://altafmukati.home.blog">http://altafmukati.home.blog</a><br />My Blogger <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://good-learning-videos.blogspot.com/">https://good-learning-videos.blogspot.com/</a><br /><br />#Education&amp;Entertainment<br />#DrMukati{% endraw %}
