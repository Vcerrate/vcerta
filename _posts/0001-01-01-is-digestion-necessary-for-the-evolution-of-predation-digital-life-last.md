{% raw %}Last time, I introduced my quest for the evolution of predation, and how a difficult task I had ahead of me. Since then, I implemented material simulation and digestion, which did help!<br /> <br /><br />Link to the previous episode: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkMoFJNcLA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkMoFJNcLA</a><br /><br />=================================<br /><br />The Bibites is an Artificial Life (Living AI!) simulation where I recreate some biological processes and let the lifeforms live, eat, reproduce, and mutate, leading to active evolution.<br />They can evolve their body through a genetic algorithm and their behavior through a custom neural network algorithm.<br /><br />=================================<br /><br />Follow me on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TBibites">https://twitter.com/TBibites</a><br />Support the project on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/leocaussan">https://www.patreon.com/leocaussan</a><br />Join the community on Reddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBibites/">https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBibites/</a><br />Download and play the game: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://leocaussan.itch.io/the-bibites">https://leocaussan.itch.io/the-bibites</a><br />Subscribe to the channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjJEUMnBFHOP2zpBc7vCnsA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjJEUMnBFHOP2zpBc7vCnsA</a><br /><br />=================================<br />Credits: <br />Footages from Pexels.com and Videezy.com<br />Procedural Sprites by Brax - Twitter@Braxiations<br />Intro tune by Fireballme<br /><br />#evolution #AI #devlog #simulation #ecosystem{% endraw %}
