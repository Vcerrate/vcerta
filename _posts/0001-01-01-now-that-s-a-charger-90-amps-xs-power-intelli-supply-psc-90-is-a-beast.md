Someone bought and returned this item to us (for no apparent reason). Since i have had GREAT luck with all the other XS Power chargers in the past, especially the PSC series, and i really wanted this 90 amp....i decided to keep it, unbox it and show it to you guys.  In this video i show how to set it up and get it ready for your car. You may not need 90a on the charging side but if you want to play music (or use other accessories) with your vehicle not running, this is the supply to get! It isn't JUST a charger.  I want to call it the BEST but i haven't tried all of them out there.  I haven't had a reason to!  Anyway, thanks for watching if you did! <br /><br />For info on XS Power IntelliSupplies visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://4xspower.com/shop/product-category/charging/intelli-supply/">https://4xspower.com/shop/product-category/charging/intelli-supply/</a><br /><br /><br />#battery #charger #power{% endraw %}
