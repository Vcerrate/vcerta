{% raw %}Elden Ring has finally released, and while it's a great game, I still find myself slightly disappointed.  It's basically just Dark Souls 3 combined with Breath of the Wild, but without most of the things that made BOTW great.  Also, From software boss design gets worse with each entry, I swear.  But, it's still a fun game.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/syntheticman">https://www.patreon.com/syntheticman</a><br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />1:33 Gameplay Mechanics<br />6:18 Boss Design Rant<br />10:02 PC Performance Issues<br />11:17 Open World Design<br />14:29 Difficulty Balance Issues &amp; Summons<br />18:17 Atmosphere &amp; Lore<br />19:50 Enemy Variety<br />22:19 Conclusion{% endraw %}
