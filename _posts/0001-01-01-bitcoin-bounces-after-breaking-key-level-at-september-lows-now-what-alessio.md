{% raw %}Bitcoin bounces after breaking key level at september lows... now what?  Last month we warned that bitcoin was remaining too long below the weekly 21 EMA.  This was a warning sign of potential weakness for bitcoin, which was right since bitcoin dropped lower just below the Septmember lows near 40K. However, bitcoin has managed to quickly recover from that level of support and bounced higher.  What could this mean for the crypto and what can we learn from the charts? #Bitcoin #BTC #AlessioRastani<br /><br />For membership (including the 3 months extra offer):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3nkZ4b4">https://bit.ly/3nkZ4b4</a><br /><br />For the trusted MT4 chart software we use:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3cCkOKm">https://bit.ly/3cCkOKm</a><br /><br />For more visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3gz3hDG">https://bit.ly/3gz3hDG</a><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2lz33DQ|">http://bit.ly/2lz33DQ|</a> ðŸ””Make sure to enable ALL push notifications!ðŸ””<br />Watch the NEWEST videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2md7PHD">http://bit.ly/2md7PHD</a><br /><br />Follow Alessio Rastaniâ€‹:<br />Twitter: â€‹<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/alessiorastani">https://twitter.com/alessiorastani</a><br /><br />Watch more Alessio Rastaniâ€‹:<br />Expert Interviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2lHdK7n">http://bit.ly/2lHdK7n</a><br />Important Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2md78y1">http://bit.ly/2md78y1</a><br />Latest Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2md7PHD">http://bit.ly/2md7PHD</a><br />Popular Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2mcbaXj">http://bit.ly/2mcbaXj</a>{% endraw %}
