{% raw %}Take a walk around the World Financial Center in New York City. From there, I go under the WTC to the Oculus. The World Financial Center (WFC), known as Brookfield Place, is a good place to come if you are visiting NYC. After looking at the food options in the WFC I head to the Oculus In the World Trade Center. The Oculus is under the Freedom Tower (World Trade Center) and is also home to many stores as well as NYC subways and the Path Train to New Jersey. This walk through the World Trade Center is July 2021.<br /><br /><br /><br />To see other NYC videos, check out my playlist @to go is to know{% endraw %}
