{% raw %}I MUST get the Merry Mondo Bundle before Beesmas ends or I won't get the Gifted Mythic Egg! What will the Merry Mondo Bundle give me? And will I finally get the Supreme Star Amulet? There's so little time left in Beesmas and I need to get the 25,000 snowflakes so I can buy the Mondo Bundle. But it's so hard! However, I'm the greatest grinder to ever play the game and there isn't any grass outside so I think I can do it. Watch the video for my epic adventure in Bee Swarm Simulator!<br /><br />► I stream LIVE on my second channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFNnBvc8DAhEj1lc4syr0yA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFNnBvc8DAhEj1lc4syr0yA</a><br /><br />Follow me if you're cool:<br /><br />➤ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/VitaminDeeeeee">https://twitter.com/VitaminDeeeeee</a><br />➤ TikTok if you want to see my doge: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vitamindelicious">https://www.tiktok.com/@vitamindelicious</a><br />Business Inquiries: itsvitamindelicious@gmail.com<br /><br />#BeeSwarmSimulator #Roblox{% endraw %}
