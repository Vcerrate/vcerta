{% raw %}Poland sent 100 T-72M tanks and a large number of BMP-1s to Ukraine.<br />Poland substantially compensated for the losses of Ukrainian tanks.<br /><br />Poland has begun the process of transferring its T-72M tanks to Ukraine, which allows the Armed Forces of Ukraine to significantly compensate for the irretrievable losses of this equipment. According to the Avia.pro source, who previously claimed that Poland is preparing to transfer to Ukraine its armored vehicles from among those that were delivered here back in Soviet times, Poland will transfer to Ukraine up to 100 T-72M tanks and an unnamed number of infantry fighting vehicles BMP -1 (presumably 30 units).<br /><br />Taking into account the available official data, today the loss of Ukraine is 2153 tanks and armored combat vehicles. This indicates that about 6% of all this equipment will be reimbursed. Moreover, taking into account the Czech T-72 and BMP-1 tanks previously transferred to Ukraine, the number of military equipment in the Armed Forces of Ukraine has increased significantly. In addition, today there is information that Germany, Slovakia and a number of other NATO countries are planning to transfer their tanks to Ukraine. This indicates that in a very short time the Alliance will seriously arm Ukraine.<br /><br />At the moment, there is documentary evidence that Polish armored vehicles have already been sent to Ukraine, however, in Warsaw itself, they still do not want to report any details of the transfer of tanks and armored fighting vehicles to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.{% endraw %}
