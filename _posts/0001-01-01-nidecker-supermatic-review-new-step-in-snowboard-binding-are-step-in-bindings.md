{% raw %}Are step in bindings good? This is my review of the Nidecker Supermatic Bindings. The Supermatic Bindings are a new step in snowboard binding from Nidecker that will hit the market next season. Do they beat the Burton Step On Bindings, The Clew Bindings, Or even a regular non step in snowboard binding? <br /><br />360 Camera (invisible selfie stick) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.insta360.com/sal/one_x2?insrc=INRUQU3">https://www.insta360.com/sal/one_x2?insrc=INRUQU3</a><br />REVIEW HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/7Y-22r2Gpak">https://youtu.be/7Y-22r2Gpak</a><br />Action Camera for the other shots - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.insta360.com/sal/one_r?insrc=INRUQU3">https://www.insta360.com/sal/one_r?insrc=INRUQU3</a><br /><br />To support the channel - PayPal Tip Jar: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/malcolmmoore0301">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/malcolmmoore0301</a><br />I really appreciate the support here, but a thumbs up is always more than enough!<br /><br />I Wear Yuki Threads: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3bu56Rc">https://bit.ly/3bu56Rc</a><br /><br /><br />If you would like to have snowboard lessons with me here in Alpe d'Huez, France, then take a look at my website below to find out more:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://masterclasssnowboarding.com/">https://masterclasssnowboarding.com/</a><br /><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/malcolmmooresnowboarding/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/malcolmmooresnowboarding/?hl=en</a><br /><br />If you're in the UK or Europe, I recommend this shop for buying snowboarding equipment, it costs you nothing but helps me out!<br /><br />Blue Tomato - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pn.blue-tomato.com/go.cgi?pid=119&amp;wmid=cc&amp;cpid=1&amp;target=https://www.blue-tomato.com/en-GB/products/categories/Snowboard+Shop-00000000/%3Fcampaign%3Dinternaffiliates%2Fall%2Flinkgenerator%26utm_campaign%3DAll/QualityClick%26ia-pkpmtrack=100-4333136313236323131303-101-162-101">https://pn.blue-tomato.com/go.cgi?pid=119&amp;wmid=cc&amp;cpid=1&amp;target=https://www.blue-tomato.com/en-GB/products/categories/Snowboard+Shop-00000000/%3Fcampaign%3Dinternaffiliates%2Fall%2Flinkgenerator%26utm_campaign%3DAll/QualityClick%26ia-pkpmtrack=100-4333136313236323131303-101-162-101</a><br /><br />For Goggles and Sunnies I wear - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sungod.to/PuTYQNDX/">https://sungod.to/PuTYQNDX/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks for watching, please hit that like and subscribe button for more snowboarding content!<br /><br />--- Copyright Info © ---<br />➝ Allow to share/embed my videos to any sites<br />➝ Don't allow copy/re-upload of my videos on (YouTube &amp; Facebook)<br /><br />#SUPERmatic #SnowboardBindings{% endraw %}
