This is you know the republicans have been running on this now for almost 10 years. Yeah, and transgender bathrooms, right? Ever since the Q stuff really juiced it though but what also juiced it was when marriage when gay marriage was made was found to be legal by the supreme court. The republicans had to rush around to find something. and I'll tell you what juiced it as much as anything. Joe Biden's whiteness. because if joe Biden had not been an old white guy they would not have had to have leaned in so much on being transphobic on the right. if Joe Biden was a white woman it would have been about it would have been more oriented towards women in particular. there would have been some that would have been we would have heard more about feminazis. or what not honestly. and if joe Biden had been a black person you would have been we would have been back to like how this person isn't really an American or.<br />Emma: Birtherism 2.0. but now like the I just want to make this point because it's all in the s it's all coming branches off the same tree to save the children. right? you have the now let's control women and their bodies right that's and then no but then you have also this the trans kids your kids are getting indoctrinated by a liberal culture that's not connected to god. and they're going to become trans. and then you have the pedophilia branch as well. this is all that same thing.<br />Sam: But that tree is actually women staying in the kitchen.{% endraw %}
