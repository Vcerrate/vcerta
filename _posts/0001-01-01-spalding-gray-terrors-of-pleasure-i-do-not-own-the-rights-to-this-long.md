{% raw %}I do not own the rights to this long out-of-print, 1988 HBO special in which Spalding Gray delivers his monologue Terrors of Pleasure. I share this in the interest of letting the world watch this lost, weird masterpiece. <br /><br />Check out my creative writing podcast, The Drunken Odyssey, available at thedrunkenodyssey.com and on iTunes, or check out other videos on this channel.{% endraw %}
