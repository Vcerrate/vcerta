After buying a new fridge i realized it did not fit in my old fridge cabinets so i built my very own.... <br />I will show you how to build a cabinet fridge that can be functional for your space. Of course keep in mind your dimensions will be custom as no kitchen space is the same and your appliance may be different as well. <br />I allowed 2&quot; of clearnace from the back of the fridge to the wall, 4&quot; of clearance on the top and 1&quot; on either side... Remember to allow enough clearance to allow your fridge to remain cool and not overheat! <br />and remember this is my Kitchen Makeover Part 2!
