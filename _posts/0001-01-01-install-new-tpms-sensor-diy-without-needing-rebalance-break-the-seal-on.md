{% raw %}Break the seal on your tire to install new TPMS sensors yourself without needing to balance your tires again after. Do this if you are replacing an existing TPMS sensor, or if you are adding a sensor where you had a regular rubber valve before.<br /><br />If this has helped you, please consider donating. Any amount is helpful.<br />Donate: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/gabeluci">https://paypal.me/gabeluci</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.gabeshacks.com/2016/11/install-new-tpms-sensors-in-your-tires.html">http://www.gabeshacks.com/2016/11/install-new-tpms-sensors-in-your-tires.html</a><br /><br />I am installing Autel MX Sensors in my winter tires.
