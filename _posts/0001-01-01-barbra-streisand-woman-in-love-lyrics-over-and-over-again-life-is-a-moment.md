{% raw %}Life is a moment in space<br />When the dream is gone<br />It's a lonelier place<br />I kiss the morning goodbye<br />But down inside you know<br />We never know why<br />The road is narrow and long<br />When eyes meet eyes<br />And the feeling is strong<br />I turn away from the wall<br />I stumble and fall<br />But I give you it all<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />I am a woman in love<br />And I do anything<br />To get you into my world<br />And hold you within<br />It's a right I defend<br />Over and over again<br />What do I do?<br /><br />With you eternally mine<br />In love there is<br />No measure of time<br />We planned it all at the start<br />That you and I<br />Would live in each other's hearts<br />We may be oceans away<br />You feel my love<br />I hear what you say<br />No truth is ever a lie<br />I stumble and fall<br />But I give you it all<br /><br />[Chorus]<br /><br />I am a woman in love<br />And I'm talking to you<br />Do you know how it feels?<br />What a woman can do<br />It's a right<br />That I defend over and over again{% endraw %}
