{% raw %}On a miserable winter’s day, Jack heads to Wales to do some camping in the new Tesla Model Y. Pitched as the more practical, more spacious sibling to the best-selling Model 3, could this be the ultimate Tesla? Is it so liveable that you can actually live in it? And does a 6’5 man fit lengthways in the boot? All these and many other semi-important questions will be answered.<br /><br />Read Jack's blog: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fullycharged.show/blog/10-things-i-learned-from-sleeping-in-the-boot-of-a-tesla-model-y/">https://fullycharged.show/blog/10-things-i-learned-from-sleeping-in-the-boot-of-a-tesla-model-y/</a><br /><br />00:00 Another day in paradise<br />00:24 A VERY important new(ish) car<br />02:30 Building the Tesla bed<br />5:37 Build quality improved?<br />7:48 Perks of EV camping<br />9:03 Infotainment still the best?<br />10:36 My gripe...<br />11:33 Answering YOUR questions<br />15:00 Mistakes were made<br />16:55 What have we learned?<br />18:38 Driving impressions<br />20:05 Where is self-driving?<br />21:40 The BIGGEST reason to buy one<br /><br />Special thanks to Dreamcase for providing the bed set and blinds.
