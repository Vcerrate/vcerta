{% raw %}&quot;We all dream of owning a place with our best friends, but how many of us come to live it? Rishi and Rohini get to host their best friends, and it's going to be so much fun to watch all of them living together. As they say, some setbacks bring fun to your life! Abhimanyu and Meera are going to spend a few days at their best friends Rishi and Rohini's place as the renovation of their apartment has fallen behind. Meera has recently taken up vlogging and always has a camera on her sleeves. Always curious to look for new subjects to shoot, Meera starts shooting at Rishi and Rohini's place. For how long will this unexpected intrusion last?
