{% raw %}Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. DOOOOM! A lot of people say this is the weakest Indiana Jones movie, and those people are correct, but it's still kind of rad. Oh, and there are sins, of course. <br /><br />Thursday: dinosaur sins. <br /><br />Remember, no movie is without sin. Which movie's sins should we count next?<br /><br />•CinemaSins website• <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cinemasins.com">https://www.cinemasins.com</a>  <br /><br />•Channels•<br />--TVSins: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TVSins/">https://www.youtube.com/c/TVSins/</a><br />--MusicVideoSins: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/musicvideosins/">https://www.youtube.com/c/musicvideosins/</a><br />--CommercialSins: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChg9sWwaJ2TYqpaYqerY5BA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChg9sWwaJ2TYqpaYqerY5BA</a> <br />--CinemaSins Podcast Network: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Nxj5dpHf2p7cN9qdUVEzA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Nxj5dpHf2p7cN9qdUVEzA</a> <br /><br />•SinClub Members get MORE!
