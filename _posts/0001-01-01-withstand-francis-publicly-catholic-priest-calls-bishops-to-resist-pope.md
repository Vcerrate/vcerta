{% raw %}Vatican Journalist Diane Montagna Interviews Courageous Catholic Priest at RemnantNewspaepr.com <br /><br />Here's an excerpt from The Remnant interview: <br /><br />Fr. Mawdsley, why did you make this video?<br /><br />Because if we do not speak the obvious truth then truth will die in us. Pope Francis, Archbishop Roche, Cardinal Cupich, and many other bishops are acting illegally in attempting to suffocate tradition. They are betraying the mission which Jesus gave to the Church. It would be wonderful if they were so surprised by the strength of resistance that they reconsidered and repented. But their reaction is not the priority. More important is that priests speak the truth without fear, otherwise we have nothing left. The flock is starving.

And most importantly, for God’s glory. Those who had Tradition robbed from them in the 1950-70s did not know where it was leading. We have seen the horror, the indignity, the weakness, and inappropriateness of the Novus Ordo. In essence it is still Christ’s awesome Holy Sacrifice of Calvary; but what man has done to His Memorial is a faithless insult to God.<br /><br />Read Full Interview Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://remnantnewspaper.com/web/index.php">https://remnantnewspaper.com/web/index.php</a><br /><br />Support Father Mawdsley YouTube Channel Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnmljV6VccKHy_TbbeAMuFg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnmljV6VccKHy_TbbeAMuFg</a><br /><br />Like, Comment, and Subscribe to our channel!<br /><br />If you'd like to contribute to RTV's expansion, please consider a donation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://remnantnewspaper.com/web/index.php/donate-today">https://remnantnewspaper.com/web/index.php/donate-today</a><br /><br />Stay Connected to RTV.
