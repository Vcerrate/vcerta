{% raw %}I play a Magic the Gathering Online Modern league with Resurgent Belief Shark Combo, a deck from Patreon subscriber Joe! This deck uses powerful card draw and looting spells to fill your graveyard with Shark Typhoons and Omniscience to put them back into play with Resurgent Belief. With Omniscience you can combo Glittering Wish for Conflux to get Approach of the 2nd Sun and win on the spot, or make a zillion giant sharks! Shark attack! Azorius Control with a combo finish!
