{% raw %}This video goes into the theory of the Signifier and the Signified as developed by Lacan. In his paper &quot;The instance of the Letter in the Unconscious&quot;, Lacan connects linguistics to the Freudian school of Psychoanalysis. What we will furthermore see, is the connection between linguistics, psychoanalysis and the products of our unconscious, that is, the Stories, Myths and Legends of the past and present.<br /><br />Contact<br />Mail: info@eversbrothers.com{% endraw %}
