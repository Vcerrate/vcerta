{% raw %}Finding low competition keywords with a high traffic potential is not as difficult as you might think. Ahrefs makes the Job easy. All you need to do is go to the keyword research tab in Ahrefs, type in the short-tail keyword and Ahrefs is going to show you various search terms. Then you need to select a KD (Keyword Difficulty) level between 0 to let's say 15. Ahrefs will show you a list of low-difficulty keywords and you will be able to see the volume and traffic potential against each keyword. You can even sort the list by potential traffic volume against the low competition keywords. Watch the video tutorial to learn more.{% endraw %}
