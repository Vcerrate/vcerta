{% raw %}In the early 20th century, British Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett found a mysterious document in the National Library of Brazil that spoke of an ancient city lost in the jungles of the Amazon. Then, during an expedition with his son and a companion in 1925, the three explorers vanished. However, it is believed that they might have been close to the place they were looking for. <br /><br />When Fawcett found Manuscript 512, he was taken aback. The document was written by Portuguese bandeirante João da Silva Guimarães and stated that as early as 1753, explorers had discovered ruins that included arches, a statue, and a temple engraved with enigmatic hieroglyphs. And although the narration was detailed, the city's exact location was not mentioned. <br /><br />Fawcett then began preparing an expedition to find the ruins, but World War 1 broke out, and the British government withdrew its support. <br /><br />After serving in the Western front during the war, Fawcett undertook a personal journey to find “Z” in 1920, but was forced to stop due to an illness and the fact that he had to shoot his own pack animal. <br /><br />The adventurer tried again five years later, this time accompanied by his son Jack and a friend of his, Raleigh Rimell. However, the three soon disappeared in the Mato Grosso jungle. <br /><br />Several researchers argue that the explorer might have been influenced by indigenous tales, and locals could have told Fawcett of the archaeological site of Kuhikugu, near the Xingu River.<br /><br />After Fawcett’s presumed death, the actual site of Kuhikugu was discovered, and it contained the ruins of about 20 towns and villages. Moreover, it is estimated that about 50,000 people might have lived in the extensive township. <br /><br />In addition, vast geometrical earthworks were discovered in interfluvial settings along the southern Amazonia, and this fact has been recognized as supporting Fawcett’s theory. <br /><br />While some relate the Lost City of Z with the infamous El Dorado, the mythical place has inspired its own set of stories, including a book by David Grann and a film adaptation by director James Gray.{% endraw %}
