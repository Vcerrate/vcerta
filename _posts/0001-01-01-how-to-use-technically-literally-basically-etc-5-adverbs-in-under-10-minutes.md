{% raw %}A subscriber recently asked me how to use technically, literally, basically, and adverbs like these, so I made a video about them! <br /><br />In this video I explain the differences between the adverbs technically, literally, basically, practically, and essentially, and provide you with examples followed by my own definitions, so you can better understand their meaning.{% endraw %}
