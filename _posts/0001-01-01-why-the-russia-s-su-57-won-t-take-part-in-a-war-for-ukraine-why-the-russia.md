{% raw %}Why the Russia’s SU-57 Won’t Take Part in a War for Ukraine<br /><br />The Su-57 has been in service in the Russian Air Force since December 2020, it is not expected to play any part in possible hostilities on Russia’s western borders. This is despite the fighters being deployed under the Russian Military’s Southern Military District which is responsible for territory bordering Ukraine.<br /><br />The fighter’s capabilities are overwhelmingly superior to the Su-35, including a higher endurance, the ability to track 60 targets simultaneously using six radars on each fighter, integration of a nose-mounted AESA radar, stealth capabilities, and use of the new K-77M air to air missile as its primary armament, among many other advantages.{% endraw %}
