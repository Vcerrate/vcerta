{% raw %}Gabi Garcia is a freak of nature. Standing at 6-feet-2 inches, and weighing a staggering 235 pounds, she is one fearsome woman. A professional martial artist with a specialty in Jiu-Jitsu, Gabi Garcia has also tasted a significant amount of success in MMA.She currently has a 7 and O record. One of the bouts was a no contest, 4 of the remaining six were won by submission and 2 were concluded by technical knockouts. As a result, Garcia remains undefeated in Female Mixed Martial Arts.<br />And that begs the question, with a physique like hers, how would she fare in the men's division of MMA?<br /><br />Narrator: Tysmithvoice<br />Researcher/Writer: Emekaekwuribe<br />Video Editor: Lance<br /><br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artlist.io">https://artlist.io</a><br />Stock Media Footage: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://motionarray.com/browse/stock-video">https://motionarray.com/browse/stock-video</a><br />More Stock footage: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://elements.envato.com">https://elements.envato.com</a><br /><br />Support the channel with links below!<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ChrisVisionz">https://twitter.com/ChrisVisionz</a><br />Subscribe to Brutal TV for more videos.<br /><br />Channel Description:<br />This channel is dedicated to all different types of Martial Arts.
