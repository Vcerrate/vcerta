{% raw %}………and boy was he an unwelcome visitor!  I threw everything at this horrible virus that I could lay my hands on, which I hope you also find useful. On an upside, I did get to watch the latest Liam Neeson movie on Sky Cinema (4 stars from me!) plus a whole host of movies and box sets that I’ll share with you. (I couldn’t do much else for a week!) I also compare my fitness regime with 69-year-old Neeson’s - not as far off as you’d imagine -  and show you my favourite short work-out, filmed during one of our many lockdowns! Hope you enjoy and stay safe.
