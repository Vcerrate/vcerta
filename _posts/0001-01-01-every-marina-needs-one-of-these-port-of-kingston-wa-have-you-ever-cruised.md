{% raw %}Have you ever cruised to the Port of Kingston, WA? <br /><br />If you have, you'll likely agree that it's a fantastic port of call for cruisers and is less than 15 NM from downtown Seattle, making it ideal for a quick weekend getaway. If you haven't been to Kingston, we hope you make a trip soon to experience the friendly marina staff, the great little town within walking (or driving) distance from the marina, and most of all the GEM ELECTRIC CAR that you can use compliments of the Port of Kingston. <br /><br />The Puget Sound region has over 200 marinas all within 15 miles of each other, so this region is what we consider some of the best boating in the world. You don't need to be retired or have months of vacation time to explore and experience the greatness of it all; you only need a weekend to experience the ports, the fun and the beauty that's everywhere you look. <br /><br />Enjoy!<br />----------<br />Website: www.mvfreedomseattle.com<br />Instagram: @mvfreedomseattle<br />—————<br /><br />Are you interested in what products we use in/on our boat or what gear we use to create our videos?
