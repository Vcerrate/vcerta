{% raw %}More precipitation will occur in Southern California on Friday and into Saturday night. There will be 2 separate storms systems (closed upper lows along a strong Pacific jet stream) and the weekend storm will be the coldest with lowest snow levels. Thunderstorms and brief heavy rain are expected. Significant snowfall and travel impacts above 3500 feet. Despite the additional precipitation the weather pattern is unfavorable for improvements to California water supply and following a record dry January and February. <br /><br /><br /><br />-------------------------<br /><br />National Weather Service<br /><br />Weather Forecast Office<br /><br />San Diego, CA<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://weather.gov/sandiego">http://weather.gov/sandiego</a>{% endraw %}
