{% raw %}This video provides a basic introduction to the Schrödinger equation by exploring how it can be used to perform simple quantum mechanical calculations. After explaining the basic structure of the equation, the infinite square well potential is used as a case study. The separation of variables approach is used to solve the Schrödinger equation and Born's probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction is used to calculate the expectation value of the position of a particle in a box. Stationary states are discussed, and it is then shown that a linear superposition of energy eigenstates leads to non-stationary states with uncertain energy. The oscillation frequency of a simple superposition of states is calculated and comparisons with radiation emission from atoms is discussed.<br /><br />You can help support this channel via the Physics Explained Patreon account: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/physicsexplained">https://www.patreon.com/physicsexplained</a><br /><br />You can follow me on instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/physicsexpl...">https://www.instagram.com/physicsexpl...</a><br /><br />You can follow me on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PhysicsExplain1">https://twitter.com/PhysicsExplain1</a>{% endraw %}
