{% raw %}I filmed this sequence of clips of two young beavers in the South Saskatchewan River in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada on a chilly April evening. I believe the videos show two young beavers getting acquainted and perhaps finding a mate. It is a very interesting glimpse into beaver behaviour. I hope you enjoy it.{% endraw %}
