Don’t worry, there isn’t a concept car insight in this video - this is what these new cars will actually look like! <br /><br />So let’s take a closer look… Both the 7 Series &amp; i7 are remarkably similar, which means both look less aggressive than the previous-generation 7 Series, coming with a massive grille upfront, flush door handles, and a much cleaner rear end. If anything, the rear design makes it look a bit old fashioned! <br /><br />Step inside, and there are luxurious designs and materials throughout the entire cabin. Both cars come with BMW’s curved infotainment screen, which is attached to a minimalist dash. There are also a number of trims and materials to choose from, too, including cashmere seat fabric! <br /><br />The biggest improvement to the interior, though, is definitely in the rear. Back seat passengers will have the option to reveal a 31” 8k cinema screen which is also accompanied by 36 speakers throughout the cabin! It’s also possible to recline the rear seats to truly enjoy your movies in style &amp; comfort. <br /><br />There are a load of engines &amp; batteries to choose from, with the 7 Series range-topper being the M760e hybrid, which combines an engine and motors to deliver 571hp and to hit 60mph in around 4.3 seconds. BMW has also confirmed an i7 M70 is on the way in the future, which should be good for 660hp &amp; 1,000Nm!! <br /><br />So what do you think - are we looking at the must-have luxury limos of 2022 &amp; 2023? Stick with Mat to see for yourself!<br /><br />Chapters<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:24 Design<br />01:46 Interior<br />02:44 Theatre Screen<br />03:40 Motors &amp; Batteries<br />04:48 Engines<br />06:17 Chassis<br />06:43 Long Wheelbase<br />07:15 Suspension<br />07:55 Driving<br />08:22 Price<br /><br />.............................................................<br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/carwow">http://www.instagram.com/carwow</a><br /><br />Tiktok - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow">https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow</a><br /><br />Facebook – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk">http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Twitter – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk">http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Sign Up to our Newsletter – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter">http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter</a><br /><br />Oder auch in Deutschland Geld beim Autokauf sparen – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/carwow-DE">http://bit.ly/carwow-DE</a><br /><br />Visita nuestra página web para saber cuánto te puedes ahorrar en tu nuevo coche – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/carwow-ES">http://bit.ly/carwow-ES</a>{% endraw %}
