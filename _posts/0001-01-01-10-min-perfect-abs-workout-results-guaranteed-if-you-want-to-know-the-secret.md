{% raw %}If you want to know the secret to attaining an impressive mid section in a short amount of time, Iâ€™ve got bad news for you, it doesnâ€™t exist. Anything worth while will require sacrifice, patience and persistence<br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ Join My App: www.trainwithfraser.app<br /><br />There are 3 things you will need to nail down if you are looking to create an impressive midsection for yourself.<br /><br />Firstly, understand that your nutrition will have the largest contribution to your body composition. In order to see your abs, you will need to be at a low enough body fat % for them to shine through. It doesn't matter if you do 1,000 crunches a day unless you understand that you need to be tackling the nutritional side of things as well. It takes two to tango and your nutrition should never be overlooked<br /><br />Secondly, Training! A lot of people believe that abs are made in the kitchen. However, this isn't entirely true. A more accurate description would be that your abs are MADE in the gym and REVEALED in the kitchen. Sure you could create a slightly defined midsection with minimal training as long as your body fat % is low enough. But, in order to develop a truly impressive midsection you will need to be approaching it from all angles. The anatomy of your midsection is far more complex than just the commonly referred to six-pack. And in order to develop these areas, you will want to directly focus on them.<br /><br />Last, but not least, you will need to be CONSISTENT. Consistency is the name of the game. Achieving solid results all comes down to the consistent application of effort in an intelligent fashion. That's it. Work smart enough, for long enough and the results will be yours.<br /><br />ðŸ‘‰GET SHREDDED IN 4 WEEKS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfNsMbADHaOkMorh_DgiVCMX3frZqfOSk">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfNsMbADHaOkMorh_DgiVCMX3frZqfOSk</a><br /><br />ðŸ‘‰Coaching Programs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fraserwilsonfitness.com">https://www.fraserwilsonfitness.com</a><br />ðŸ‘‰Subscribe: (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/84uFTA)">https://goo.gl/84uFTA)</a><br />ðŸ’ªSupplement Code: FRASER10 at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ehplabs.com/">https://www.ehplabs.com/</a><br />ðŸ‘‰Shop Gymshark: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gym.sh/Shop-Fraser2">https://gym.sh/Shop-Fraser2</a><br /><br />ADD ME ON:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/FraserWilsonFit/">https://www.instagram.com/FraserWilsonFit/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/FraserWilsonFit/">https://facebook.com/FraserWilsonFit/</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fraserwilsonfit">https://www.tiktok.com/@fraserwilsonfit</a><br />Snapchat: FraserWilsonFit{% endraw %}
