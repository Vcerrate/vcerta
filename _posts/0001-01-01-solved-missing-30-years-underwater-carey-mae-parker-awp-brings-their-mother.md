After spending just a few hours on the scene, nothing was found at that time. <br /><br />Our team here at AWP believes a proper and thorough investigation was not conducted!<br /><br />As such, we made plans to return in October to finish removing Carey's car, completing a proper forensics search for any human remains in the area. <br /><br />Our recovery of Carey took 2 days, and now Carey's family can lay her to rest. <br /><br />At the time she went missing, Parker lived with friends in Quinlan and worked the night shift at Flanders PrecisionAire, an air conditioning company in Terrell, Texas. She has three children, all of whom were under the age of six in 1991. <br /><br />She disappeared only a few days before her son's birthday, and she had been planning a party for him. Parker left her last paycheck behind, and it was eventually mailed to her father's house. There hadn't been any activity on her driver's license since 1991.<br /><br />We are humbled by the opportunity all of you have given us to help in the search for answers as to what happened to Carey.<br /><br />Hug the ones you love for you never know when it might be the last time you see them. <br /><br />As of the release of this documentary, because of your support: 16 Missing Person Cold Cases Have Been Solved since 2019, bringing resolution and answers to families looking for their lost loved ones.<br /><br />The AWP Movement would not be possible without your support, helping us travel the US offering our services for FREE to families searching for their lost loved ones.<br /><br />Please Consider Donating to AWP and Help Further Our Efforts.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://adventureswithpurpose.com/products/make-a-donation">https://adventureswithpurpose.com/products/make-a-donation</a><br /><br />üé¨üçø Watch More of Our Episodes<br /><br />SOLVED: Missing 23-years Underwater <br />(Samantha Hopper, 22-month-old Daughter Courtney, Unborn Baby)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/isqd8OOcJpQ">https://youtu.be/isqd8OOcJpQ</a><br /><br />SOLVED 84-Year-Old Missing Person Case..
