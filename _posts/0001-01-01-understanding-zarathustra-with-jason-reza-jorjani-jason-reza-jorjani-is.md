{% raw %}Jason Reza Jorjani is a philosopher and faculty member at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. He is author of Prometheus and Atlas.<br /><br />Here he points out that, while most people are unfamiliar with the details of Zarathustraâ€™s teachings, they were influential on such important European figures as Voltaire, Nietzsche, and Mozart. Unlike other ancient thinkers, Zarathustra emphasized the progressive evolution of human toward a utopian society.

His teachings exerted an influence on the Islamic Sufism of Iran as well as on the rise of Christianity.<br /><br />(Recorded on June 25, 2016)<br /><br />To download an edited Russian transcript of this video interview, go to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3fjAjr2">https://bit.ly/3fjAjr2</a><br /><br />For a complete, updated list with links to all of our videos, see <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://newthinkingallowed.com/Listings.htm.">https://newthinkingallowed.com/Listings.htm.</a><br /><br />For opportunities to engage with and support the New Thinking Allowed video channel -- please visit the New Thinking Allowed Foundation at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.newthinkingallowed.org.">http://www.newthinkingallowed.org.</a><br /><br />To join the NTA Psi Experience Community on Facebook, see <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1953031791426543/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1953031791426543/</a><br /><br />To download and listen to audio versions of the New Thinking Allowed videos, please visit our new podcast at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/new-thinking-allowed-audio-podcast/id1435178031.">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/new-thinking-allowed-audio-podcast/id1435178031.</a><br /><br />You can help support our ongoing video productions while enjoying a book.
