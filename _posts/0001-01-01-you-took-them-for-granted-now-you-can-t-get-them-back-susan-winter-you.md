{% raw %}You took your partner for granted. Now they’re gone and you’re tormented with regret. How can you get them back? #breakups #guilt #blame #ex<br /><br />Noah writes, “Hey Susan, I admire you a lot, thanks for your work. I have a question, what if I was the toxic person and the one doing most of the cheating or lying in the long-distance relationship even though all along, I knew this was &quot;the one&quot; person for me that I ended up losing. She left me suddenly and is already with another, I am having the biggest regrets and cannot let her go.
