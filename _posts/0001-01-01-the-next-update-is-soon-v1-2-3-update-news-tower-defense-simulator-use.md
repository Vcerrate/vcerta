It involves players teaming up with one another to fighting waves of different enemies until they either are overrun or triumph that particular map. Players gain cash by damaging enemies and from wave bonuses, which can subsequently be invested in buying new towers or upgrading existing ones. There is also a Versus mode where other players can team up to face down another team. In this instance, players can send enemies. Once players are defeated or triumph, they gain EXP, which is used to level up, and Coins, which can be used to purchase new towers.<br />You can play Tower Defense Simulator here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/3260590327/Tower-Defense-Simulator">https://www.roblox.com/games/3260590327/Tower-Defense-Simulator</a>{% endraw %}
