{% raw %}The Tudor Black Bay Pro 79470 is finally here and I have a lot of thoughts about it after my first 5 days with it. In short, I am absolutely loving it and pretty much all of my previous worries about the BB Pro ’s thickness have been wiped out. So in this video I’m going to go over exactly what its like to wear on my wrist, how thick it actually looks in real life compared to the Black Bay 58 Blue, and whether any of this poses a problem at all. Then I will get in to my initial impressions about my first 5 days with the Black Bay Pro and talk about what I like about the watch and what I don’t like about it. I must say after selling my 42mm Polar Rolex Explorer II 216570 a few years ago I was starting to miss it but now with the Black Bay Pro, I am all set.<br /><br />(some background) Watches And Wonders is back for 2022 and it has provided us with some great surprises from Tudor, Rolex, Grand Seiko, Oris, and many more brands from the Richemont Group and beyond. However, the release that caught my eye the most was the all new Tudor Black Bay Pro. Every year after the release of the 41mm Black Bay GMT, we've been hoping for a newer smaller GMT from Tudor, and given that this year is Tudor's 10th anniversary, we were thinking that surely 2022 is the year it'll happen. We were all expecting and hoping for a Black Bay 58 GMT, but instead we got the 39mm Black Bay Pro, which is heavily influenced by the Rolex Explorer II 1655 Freccione. This was not at all expected but I am excited about this release because it is right up my alley considering how much I love the original Rolex Explorer II.  <br /><br /><br />AWESOME STUFF- I own and love every product listed so I want to spread the love!<br /><br />Link to the San Martin SN021-G:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3G6DGOm">https://bit.ly/3G6DGOm</a><br />Link to the San Martin SN007:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_mNsB3aI">https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_mNsB3aI</a><br />Coupon Code for TWI viewers: THEWATCH (Code valid: Dec 14th 2021- Apr 30th 2022, $20 off $200)<br /><br />Link to the San Martin Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_mrWqeuA">https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_mrWqeuA</a><br /><br /><br />My favorite Amazon watches:<br /><br />Tissot PRX Powermatic 80- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2TU5zWu">https://amzn.to/2TU5zWu</a><br />Tissot PRX Quartz- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3zaetzj">https://amzn.to/3zaetzj</a><br /><br />Citizen Eco-Drive Promaster Diver- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3bQoZBw">https://amzn.to/3bQoZBw</a><br />G-Shock GW-5000- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jflUQ8">https://amzn.to/3jflUQ8</a><br />G-Shock DW-5600- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3A0Vbwx">https://amzn.to/3A0Vbwx</a><br />G-Shock GW-M5610-1BJF- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3g4fnWw">https://amzn.to/3g4fnWw</a><br />G-Shock GW-M5610-1- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3pBF6J0">https://amzn.to/3pBF6J0</a><br />G-Shock DW6900-1V- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3qcaVIu">https://amzn.to/3qcaVIu</a><br />G-Shock DW6900LS-1- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ctUvFO">https://amzn.to/3ctUvFO</a><br />G-Shock GD-100- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3471rUQ">https://amzn.to/3471rUQ</a><br /><br /><br />I own too many versions of each strap:<br />The most comfy NATO straps (the one on my BB58 925)- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hIzMSc">https://amzn.to/3hIzMSc</a> <br />Stretchy and easy pass through strap- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2RIPS3v">https://amzn.to/2RIPS3v</a><br />The strap that works when nothing else works- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3bQnjrI">https://amzn.to/3bQnjrI</a><br />The best rubber straps- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3udQ20a">https://amzn.to/3udQ20a</a><br />The most versatile leather straps- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3c64fGn">https://amzn.to/3c64fGn</a><br />The most comfy canvas strap ever- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ui2goh">https://amzn.to/3ui2goh</a><br /><br />Watch tools that I can’t live without:<br />Hand removal tool- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3qFAOkw">https://amzn.to/3qFAOkw</a><br />Pry tool- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/366H0s0">https://amzn.to/366H0s0</a><br />Movement holder- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jsHZuF">https://amzn.to/3jsHZuF</a><br />Press tool to put in new bezels- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3oFjECv">https://amzn.to/3oFjECv</a><br />Tool to pop off bezels- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SkUr3W">https://amzn.to/2SkUr3W</a><br />Strap hole puncher- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3yvvi7j">https://amzn.to/3yvvi7j</a><br />Bracelet link removal tool- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3vfRWib">https://amzn.to/3vfRWib</a><br /><br />(These are all affiliate links!
