{% raw %}How Much I Make as an Adjunct Professor?<br /><br />I’m James Callahan and this is the Do-Over Show where we dig deeper into the how and how much of things like working as an adjunct professor.<br /><br />And, yes, I’ll show you what I’m going to be paid this semester from Elmhurst University – and how much adjuncts are paid at Elmhurst.<br /><br />Let’s face it – for many of us working as adjunct instructors or lecturers or professors (whatever your school wants to call you), it’s a temp job – usually a course-by-course contract, and outside of major higher-ed systems and unions like the University of Illinois enjoys – there are no benefits, no guarantees, and no promise of promotion, more courses, or even retention after you submit the final grades each semester.<br /><br />Some of you are lucky, not as lucky as a tenure-track appointment, but maybe visiting instructors, or full-time temp professors – and I’ve been both of those when I was trying to make a living teaching in higher ed.<br /><br />But my life has changed, and I’ve heard from so many of you who have watched my other videos on adjunct pay, how to get hired and keep your job as an adjunct, and how to handle the half-truths and deceptions of administrators and – to be honest – the lies we want to believe because we hope that if we do a great job as an adjunct we’ll get a permanent position.<br /><br />That’s the lie too many of us want to believe.<br /><br />#JamesCallahan #YouTube #DoOver<br /><br />Life happens and you might have to start over.
