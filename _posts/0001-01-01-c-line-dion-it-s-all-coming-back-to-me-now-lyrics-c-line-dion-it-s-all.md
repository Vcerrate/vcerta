it<br />Right outside the window<br /> <br />There were days when the sun was so cruel<br />That all the tears turned to dust<br />And I just knew my eyes were<br />Drying up forever<br /> <br />I finished crying in the instant that you left<br />And I can't remember where or when or how<br />And I banished every memory you and I had ever made<br /> <br />But when you touch me like this<br />And you hold me like that<br />I just have to admit<br />That it's all coming back to me<br />When I touch you like this<br />And I hold you like that<br />It's so hard to believe but<br />It's all coming back to me<br />It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now<br /> <br />There were moments of gold<br />And there were flashes of light<br />There were things I'd never do again<br />But then they'd always seemed right<br />There were nights of endless pleasure<br />It was more than any laws allow<br />Baby Baby<br /> <br />If I kiss you like this<br />And if you whisper like that<br />It was lost long ago<br />But it's all coming back to me<br />If you want me like this<br />And if you need me like that<br />It was dead long ago<br />But it's all coming back to me<br />It's so hard to resist<br />And it's all coming back to me<br />I can barely recall<br />But it's all coming back to me now<br />But it's all coming back<br /> <br />There were those empty threats and hollow lies<br />And whenever you tried to hurt me<br />I just hurt you even worse<br />And so much deeper<br /> <br />There were hours that just went on for days<br />When alone at last we'd count up all the chances<br />That were lost to us forever<br /> <br />But you were history with the slamming of the door<br />And I made myself so strong again somehow<br />And I never wasted any of my time on you since then<br /> <br />But if I touch you like this<br />And if you kiss me like that<br />It was so long ago<br />But it's all coming back to me<br />If you touch me like this<br />And if I kiss you like that<br />It was gone with the wind<br />But it's all coming back to me<br />It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now<br /> <br />There were moments of gold<br />And there were flashes of light<br />There were things we'd never do again<br />But then they'd always seemed right<br />There were nights of endless pleasure<br />It was more than all your laws allow<br />Baby, Baby, Baby<br /> <br />When you touch me like this<br />And when you hold me like that<br />It was gone with the wind<br />But it's all coming back to me<br />When you see me like this<br />And when I see you like that<br />Then we see what we want to see<br />All coming back to me<br />The flesh and the fantasies<br />All coming back to me<br />I can barely recall<br />But it's all coming back to me now<br /> <br />If you forgive me all this<br />If I forgive you all that<br />We forgive and forget<br />And it's all coming back to me<br />When you see me like this<br />And when I see you like that<br />We see just what we want to see<br />All coming back to me<br />The flesh and the fantasies<br />All coming back to me<br />I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now<br /> <br />(It's all coming back to me now)<br />And when you kiss me like this<br />(It's all coming back to me now)<br />And when I touch you like that<br />(It's all coming back to me now)<br />If you do it like this (It's all coming back to me now)<br />And if we...<br /><br />THE VIBE GUIDE - Your guide to the latest music trends.<br />âž¡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank"
