{% raw %}Dan Wallace's Greek Grammar: Beyond the Basics is the modern classic intermediate Greek grammar. But it isn't without its problems. Yet, there is much to like and a few things to be wary of in this grammar, and these play a role in how you might want to use it. In this video, we'll take a look at the things I like and don't like in this grammar and see why you should have a copy on your shelf. <br /><br />Get your copy:<br /><br />Logos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://mntg.me/ggbb">http://mntg.me/ggbb</a><br />Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2thKeEt">http://amzn.to/2thKeEt</a><br />Abridged version: Basics of New Testament Syntax<br /><br />Logos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://mntg.me/babywallace">http://mntg.me/babywallace</a><br />Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3NKc6KK">https://amzn.to/3NKc6KK</a><br />Want a tour of my library? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/YU6OSYT-pzo">https://youtu.be/YU6OSYT-pzo</a><br /><br />üó∫ üó∫Get your free roadmap to Mastery and our new Biblical Languages Starter Pack from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biblicalmastery.academy/bonuses/">https://www.biblicalmastery.academy/bonuses/</a> <br /><br />Join the Hebrew waitlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://biblicalmastery.academy/hebrew/">https://biblicalmastery.academy/hebrew/</a> <br />Want to learn biblical Greek, now?
