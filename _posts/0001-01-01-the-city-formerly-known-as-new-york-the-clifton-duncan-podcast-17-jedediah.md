She earned a Master of Arts from Columbia University in Spanish literature before exploring the academic, business, and performing arts worlds.<br /><br />In 2010, Bila’s online writing got noticed, and she was soon appearing regularly on MSNBC, Fox News, CNBC, and national radio shows to discuss politics, education, and pop culture. She published a series of journal entries in 2011 titled &quot;Outnumbered,&quot; full of anecdotes about teaching in Manhattan during the 2008 presidential election.

Bila hosted a Lifetime special, Abby Tells All, in the summer of 2017. <br /><br />The following year, Bila released &quot;#DoNotDisturb: How I Ghosted My Cell Phone to Take Back My Life&quot; (Harper) and did an extensive book tour in New York and Los Angeles, hitting NBC’s Today, ABC’s The View and GMA, Hallmark’s &quot;Home &amp; Family&quot;, and a wide range of cable news, digital, and local news programming.
