{% raw %}Subscribe to @Joy Again <br /><br />Lyrics:<br />I guess I should stop<br />Looking out for you<br />Like I always do<br />When will you<br />Start looking out for me too<br />Instead of leaving me staring at my shoes<br />Just the way you're glancing at me<br />Something about you<br />Just makes me feel guilty for<br />Liking you<br />When you're with him<br />When you're with him<br />This is a love song for a girl<br />Who will never know it's about her<br />Know it's pretty stupid<br />But I'm much too shy to tell her<br />She's beaming that smile all the while<br />I'm all tripped up on my own throat<br />I guess there is no hope<br />When you're walking out in the snow<br />I say I guess I should go<br />And we're talking about someone else<br />When we should be talking about ourselves<br />It's the same old situation<br />You've always got me waiting<br />Come on dear I think times a wastin'<br />Before we have to go back inside<br />And return to our normal lives<br />This is a love song for a girl<br />Who will never know it's about her<br />Know it's pretty stupid<br />But I'm much too shy to tell her<br />She's beaming that smile all the while<br />I'm all tripped up on my own throat<br />I guess there is no hope{% endraw %}
