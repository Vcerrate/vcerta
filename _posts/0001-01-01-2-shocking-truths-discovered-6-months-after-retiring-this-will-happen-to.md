The content of these videos is not intended to be advice, but rather to tell my experience and story; they are for your entertainment only.   Seek professional advice before making any financial decision including when to become financially independent and/or retire early. <br /><br />#financialindependence #FIRE #retirement #saving #investing #happy #success #australia<br /><br /><br />Joe Kuhn is first and foremost a plant manager and leader; and now an entrepreneur.    He has been a plant manager 3 times (largest plant $1.5B in sales / 2000 employees), a large department manager twice, an engineer, and due to his results he was appointed the global director of reliability and maintenance for a Fortune 200 company.    His unique approach to driving reliability results come from not only his 32 years of experience, but also through the application of  Lean and Six-Sigma concepts.      Lean provides the &quot;secret sauce&quot; to achieving sustainable and rapid results -- most often in just weeks.     This result fosters both sponsorship and future investment as a portion of the savings.   All of these are combined to evolve a culture though new experiences.<br /><br />The same principles that deliver a reliability culture I have found will also deliver financial independence - I'm so thankful for this.    Taking the long view, planning for the future, and commitment to execution are fundamental.    The concepts of reliability and FI are not new - yes, a few changes each year; but, disciplined execution is always the reason for success or failure -- rarely information.   In my videos, I tell my story.   It is not perfect; I've made mistakes; but I always focused on the long view.  My hope is not for you to try to copy my story, but rather, to be inspired to write your success story.    I am not a financial advisor -- I'm a story teller.{% endraw %}
