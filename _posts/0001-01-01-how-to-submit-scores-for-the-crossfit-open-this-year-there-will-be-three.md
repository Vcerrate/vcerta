{% raw %}This year, there will be three ways to submit a score for the CrossFit Open —  affiliate validation, video submission, or by way of a registered judge. <br /><br />New this year, scores will be visible on the Leaderboard immediately upon submission, not validation. Scores that haven’t been validated by the submission deadline will be eliminated from the Leaderboard. <br /><br />Learn more about Open workout score submission to find the best option for you and successfully lock in your scores on the worldwide Leaderboard. <br /><br />#CrossFitGames{% endraw %}
