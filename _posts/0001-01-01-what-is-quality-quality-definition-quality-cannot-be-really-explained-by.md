{% raw %}Quality cannot be really explained by only one parameter. To define what is quality you have to know your customers and work in a team.<br /><br />The video is presenting what is quality information but also try to cover the following subject:<br />- Quality definition<br />- Quality meaning<br />- Product quality<br /><br /><br /><br />✏️ Transcript of the video<br /><br />It is not easy to define what quality is.<br /><br />Often the definition of quality is approached with excellence,<br />good materials etc. but this is not always the case.<br /><br />Quality is in our customer's mind.<br /><br /><br /><br />▶ Quality Definition Example<br /><br />I'll give you an example:<br /><br />If a customer wants to buy a car he could consider it as parameters<br />quality the following characteristics.<br /><br />- Appearance<br />- Fuel consumption<br />- Comfort<br />- Brand<br />- Reliability<br />- Price<br /><br />Combining these six parameters and obtaining a single quality value is not easy.<br /><br />Additionally, one customer might value a high price as a hallmark of uniqueness while another might value a low price as a key feature.<br /><br />In summary, the quality of a product or service is that which meets the customer's value system.<br /><br />It could therefore happen that a customer might evaluate your company's product as low quality even if the product has characteristics that you consider excellent.<br /><br />The reason for this difference is that the value system of the customer and your company are not aligned.<br /><br /><br /><br />▶ Conclusions<br /><br />Ok.<br /><br />Therefore, to define what quality is, it is essential to meet and talk with customers.<br /><br />It is essential that a cross-functional team works to understand what customers perceive as quality before even making the product.<br /><br /><br /><br />ツ  CONNECT WITH ME ツ<br /><br />Hi,<br /><br />my name is Mark Anderson a 20+ year Lean Expert.<br />I have created LeanVlog because I want to spread Lean Thinking worldwide and I think the video is the most effective way to teach, learn, and spread knowledge.<br /><br />If you want to stay in touch with me you can choose the channel you prefer.<br /><br />A) To Be Updated on the Lean Videos and Communicate<br />• LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-valente-b83aaa14b/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-valente-b83aaa14b/</a><br /><br />B) Meet on Facebook<br />• Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/LeanLab-146290372099121">https://www.facebook.com/LeanLab-146290372099121</a><br /><br />C) Latest Videos and Playlist.<br />• Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.leanvlog.com">https://www.leanvlog.com</a><br /><br />D) 2 Videos every week.<br />• Telegram Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/leanvlog">https://t.me/leanvlog</a>{% endraw %}
