{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://macmost.com/e-1764">https://macmost.com/e-1764</a> Version 5.2 of Numbers brings a new/old feature, Smart Categories. This is similar to the old Categories feature in Numbers prior to 2013, and similar to Pivot Tables in Excel. Using Smart Categories is relatively simple, however, as you simply groups together similar rows and allows you to see totals, averages, counts and other data pertaining to those groups.{% endraw %}
