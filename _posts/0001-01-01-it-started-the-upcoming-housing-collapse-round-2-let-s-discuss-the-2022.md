And it also might reduce demand from home buyers, especially for people really sensitive to prices.”<br /><br />THIRD: HOME SALES<br />Throughout February, home sales actually DROPPED 2.7%…and, in March, they dropped another 4.1% - meaning, fewer buyers are purchasing properties now that mortgage rates are increasing. According to Redfin, 12% of homes on its site saw sellers cut prices in the week ending April 9. That was the biggest one-month spike Redfin saw in price cuts since 2015.<br /><br />Although, in terms of my OWN thoughts on this…since, I have been FULL TIME in the real estate industry since 2008…I can absolutely see rising rates having an impact on values throughout the near future…but, LONG TERM…a lack of inventory, combined with decades of under-building, is likely going to keep prices relatively high for quite some time…even though, some areas will likely see the market BEGINNING to soften. <br /><br />For business or one-on-one real estate investing/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com<br /><br />Creator Properties - This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy an interest in any fund or investment vehicle.
