{% raw %}Nimbu eating close to the camera, and filmed in slow motion.  While it may not be an exactly fascinating video for most, I love watching how birds eat.  Since his eyes have bright and distinctive rings, it is easy to watch their movement and dilation.  <br /><br />Nimbu is one of our rescued budgies that we adopted in September 2018.  He landed on someone that was having a party in their backyard,  taken to the local bird store, quarantined for 30 days while searching for the owner - which - never came forward looking for him, and he was placed for adoption.  We estimate his age currently at 5 years old.  Nimbu means &quot;lemon&quot; in Hindi.  He is calm, gentle-natured, and easy-going.  He spends most of his time hanging out with the cockatiels, eating, and talking to himself.{% endraw %}
