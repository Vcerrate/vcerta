All of these exercises are safe to do during pregnancy, as long as you have been cleared by your doctor or midwife for pregnancy.  Exercise is recommended to naturally induce labor, however,  there is no guarantee.  Please only attempt to induce labor if your doctor or midwife has agreed you are ready (usually 37 weeks and beyond).{% endraw %}
