But one of Saylor‚Äôs most interesting talking points was where he believes Bitcoin is in the maturation cycle as an asset.  It‚Äôs no secret that Saylor made a small fortune during the 2010‚Äôs as an individual investor picking Facebook, Google, and Apple stocks, holding throughout the turbulent times and cashing out once they reached maturity.  Saylor did so well with that strategy, that he pinned the book, ‚ÄúThe Mobile Wave‚Äù, explaining his thoughts and process.  Saylor stated in hindsight, those companies seem like the obvious winner but at the time, 95% of the people were skeptical about the stocks as long-term holders, which is eerily similar to what is currently going on in the crypto market.  According to Saylor, the volatility and FUD surrounding Google, Facebook and Amazon are the same as the FUD and volatility of Bitcoin.  Nonetheless, Saylor believes now is the perfect time to buy bitcoin before it becomes a mature asset.  And Saylor just isn‚Äôt a pundit.  He clearly puts his money where his mouth is.  Just recently, Microstrategy took out a $205 Milion Loan to buy more Bitcoin,  collateralized with about $820 million in bitcoin, representing about 12% of MicroStrategy‚Äôs overall cryptocurrency holdings.  The move is unprecedented.  Saylor‚Äôs conviction on NOW being the best time to buy is in full effect. <br />‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨<br />THIS INTERVIEW WAS POSTED ON MARCH 28, 2022<br />Listen to the full unedited interview here ‚¨á [Credits] üôè<br />Interview with Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy on Bitcoin, Crypto, Inflation, Russia-Ukraine<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v9O1g-q_mA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v9O1g-q_mA</a><br />‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨<br />üéµBACKGROUND MUSIC licensed through AudioJungle &amp; Epidemic Sound <br /><br />üé•FOOTAGE licensed through VideoBlocks and Filmpac, except parts about the topic that have been used under fair use.<br />‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨<br />FAIR-USE COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER <br />Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
