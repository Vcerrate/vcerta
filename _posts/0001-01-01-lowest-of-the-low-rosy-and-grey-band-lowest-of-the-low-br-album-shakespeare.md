{% raw %}Band: Lowest of the Low<br />Album: Shakespeare My Butt<br />Song: Rosy and Grey<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />I want to take a streetcar downtown <br />Read Henry Miller and wander around <br />And drink some Guinness from a tin <br />'Cause my U.I. cheque has just come in <br />Ah, where you been... because <br /><br />Everything is coming up rosy and grey <br />Ah, the wind is cold but the smell of snow warms me today <br />And your smile is fine and it's just like mine and it won't go away, 'cause <br />Everything is rosy and grey <br /><br />You've been under my skin for more than eight years <br />It's been eight years of laughter and eight years of tears <br />And I don't know what the future can hold, or will do, for me and you<br />But I'm a much better man for having known you <br />Yeah, you know that's true, because... <br /><br />Everything is coming up rosy and grey <br />Ah, the wind is cold but the smell of snow warms me today <br />And your smile is fine and it's just like mine and it won't go away, 'cause <br />Everything is rosy and grey <br /><br />Well, I've been told that there's a sucker born every day <br />Well, I wonder who, yeah, I wonder who <br />Maybe the one who doesn't realize there's a thousand shades of grey <br />'Cause I know that's true, yes I do, I know that's true <br />How about you? <br /><br />Well, they're picking up trash and they're putting down roads <br />And they're brokering stocks, the class-struggle explodes <br />And I'll play this guitar just the best that I can <br />Well, maybe I'm not and maybe I am <br />Who gives a damn? <br />Well, I've kissed you in France and I've kissed you in Spain <br />And I've kissed you in places I'd better not name <br />And I've seen the sun go down on Sacre Coeur <br />But I like it much better going down on you <br />Ah, you know that's true{% endraw %}
