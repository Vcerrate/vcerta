{% raw %}Jesse Cook | Rumba Flamenco Music| The Best of &quot;Love in the Time of Covid&quot;<br /><br />I recorded these songs at home, over four months, at the height of lockdown. Music gave me a way to escape the four walls of my house. And posting these videos gave me a community of music lovers to connect with once a week during our Friday premieres. With music and friends, you can get through almost anything.<br /><br />Although most of what you see here is me, alone, playing all the instruments, recording, mixing, filming and editing these videos, I was very fortunate to have friends and family who jumped in to help on a few. I am eternally grateful to: CCDOP, Nancy, Corey, both Juans, Dan, Marito, Fethi, and Matt.<br /><br />00:00 Azul<br />03:01 Rain<br />05:50 Rattle and Burn<br />09:24 Cascada<br />12:53 Libre<br />15:29 Into the Dark<br />19:41 Taxi Brazil<br />22:18 Breathing Below Surface<br />28:34 Afternoon at Satie's<br />31:31 That's Right<br />35:00 Breath<br />37:44 Bogota By Bus<br />40:49 Tuesday's Child<br />45:00 Breeze From Saintes Maries<br />49:11 All That Remains<br /><br />This list is not the complete series. There where other videos I made, but did not include. This was simply an issue of flow. I feel this collection fits together nicely, while those videos are better viewed on their own. they can be seen as part of the &quot;Love In The Time of Covid&quot; playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyIPJzlFk0B8QQcVgLfj-ApqMm6vRIeIB">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyIPJzlFk0B8QQcVgLfj-ApqMm6vRIeIB</a><br /><br />Touring near you:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tour.jessecook.com">https://tour.jessecook.com</a><br /><br />For more content:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/jesseCookHQ">https://facebook.com/jesseCookHQ</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/musicianjessecook">https://www.instagram.com/musicianjessecook</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/jessecookhq">https://soundcloud.com/jessecookhq</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jessecookofficial">https://www.tiktok.com/@jessecookofficial</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://jessecook.com">http://jessecook.com</a>{% endraw %}
