{% raw %}Europe today is facing major challenges, from growing poverty and inequalities, exacerbated by the pandemic, to climate change, digitalization, the future of work, migration, geopolitics, and many others. The Conference on the Future of Europe offers a unique opportunity to improve the Union's ability to deal with these issues, not least by involving social partners and EU citizens who can offer concrete insights into their actual needs and expectations.<br /><br />Trade Unions, representing workers in the European Union, have a unique and particularly important point of view on what is at stake for Europeans. We, as Workers' Group, call for the conference to focus on what matters most to the citizens, what touches their everyday lives: social issues, jobs, housing, health, education, culture, digital revolution, a fair transition towards a climate-neutral and sustainable Europe and the role of Europe. For us, it is important that workers, trade unions, social partners, civil society organisations, the EESC, as civil society interface, have their say in this process. <br /><br />Join us for the debate on the actions around and the expectations from the Conference on the Future of Europe to be attended by several high-level personalities, actors in the organisation of this conference, including Portuguese Secretary of State for EU Affairs and co-chair of the CoFoE Executive Board, Ana Paula Zacarias, former ALDE President and co-chair of the CoFoE Executive Board, Guy Verhofstadt, S&amp;D President Iratxe Garcia Perez, CoR President Apostolos Tzitzikostas, and MEP and observer at the CoFoE Executive Board Helmut Scholz.{% endraw %}
