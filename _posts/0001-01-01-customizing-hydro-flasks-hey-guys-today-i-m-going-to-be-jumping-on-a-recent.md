{% raw %}Hey Guys! Today I‚Äôm going to be jumping on a recent trend (kind of, I‚Äôm a little late, but‚Ä¶.better late than never?). You guys know how I‚Äôm obsessed with painting‚Ä¶.basically anything. Well, the Hydro Flask re-usable water bottles have been super popular recently and I‚Äôve seen so many people customizing them. I guess since they are pretty plain, they are just a perfect canvas for decorating and putting your own style on them. I put A LOT of time into 2 different hydro flask water bottles. I‚Äôve noticed quite a few creators doing many of these in one video, but I decided to focus on just 2, and try to do a well-done, detailed design. I decided to paint one of them with acrylic paint and one of them with Posca Paint Pens, in 2 very different themes and styles. One is more ‚Äúpainterly‚Äù (we love that word LOL) and the other is a lot more bold and cartoony. I ended up loving how both of these came out, hopefully you guys like them too! If I inspire you to customize your own hydro flask, make sure to tag me on Instagram @MoriahElizabethOfficial.<br /><br /><br /><br />BABY HAMSTER PLUSH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://me-merch.myshopify.com/">https://me-merch.myshopify.com/</a><br />The Plush is SOLD OUT!!
