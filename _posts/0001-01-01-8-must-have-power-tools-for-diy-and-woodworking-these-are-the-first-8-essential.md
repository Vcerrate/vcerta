{% raw %}These are the first 8 essential power tools you need if you are new to woodworking or have DIY projects you want to get done. Whether you're building in a garage shop or starting a backyard project you'll find these tools super helpful. A drill is an indispensable tool that you almost can't do without. Table saws, jig saws, and circular saws can sometimes be interchangeable but you'll need at least one of them. A sander is a fairly inexpensive tool that will save you time and help you achieve a smoother finish. A router is probably the last of these tools you need but once you have one you'll wonder how you went without one for so long. Pick a tool brand you like when choosing cordless tools so you can use one type of battery. Right now I'm a big fan of Milwaukee tools but there are lots of good brands like Makita, Dewalt, Bosch, Rigid, Ryobi, and more.<br />@Milwaukee Tool <br />üëç SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Iy7PK3">https://bit.ly/2Iy7PK3</a><br /><br />These are the Amazon affiliate links to the tools I use: (I make a few pennies off each sale)<br />Milwaukee M12 Fuel 2 Pc Kit- 1/2&quot; Hammer Drill &amp; 1/4&quot; Impact Driver  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3sJ385f">https://amzn.to/3sJ385f</a><br />SawStop JSS-120A60 Jobsite Saw PRO   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2TEv6iG">https://amzn.to/2TEv6iG</a><br />Bosch 12-Inch Dual-Bevel Glide Miter Saw   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3cGnEwa">https://amzn.to/3cGnEwa</a><br />Makita 5&quot; Random Orbit Sander   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3vsIqYD">https://amzn.to/3vsIqYD</a><br />Bosch Router, Colt 1-Horsepower    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3vtrhhl">https://amzn.to/3vtrhhl</a><br />Festool 561438 TS 75 EQ Plunge Cut Circular Saw   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2IgyScN">https://amzn.to/2IgyScN</a><br />Milwaukee M12 Jigsaw   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3eKfi8o">https://amzn.to/3eKfi8o</a><br /><br /><br />DIY Projects For The Backyard <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCK5XUSikQGrqL4i-VuG5IyOIOU8veo5k">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCK5XUSikQGrqL4i-VuG5IyOIOU8veo5k</a><br /><br />A DIY SMOKELESS Fire Pit That Actually Works!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/qyjxklycfJ4">https://youtu.be/qyjxklycfJ4</a><br /><br />Hanging String Lights Around My Fire Pit!
