{% raw %}Starcraft 2, Best of 3 between two young legends in the making: MaxPax (Denmark, Protoss, PSISTORM Gaming) and Clem (France, Terran, Team Liquid). This is a Group Stages Best of Three from Last Chance, which is indeed our last chance to see these two compete before Katowice. Speaking of which, if you stay to the end, I announce an informal contest in which we'll be picking our faves to win the Grand Championship at Katowice. Post your picks in the comments below! No pressure, it's just for fun.<br />   <br />#sc2 #starcraft2 #sc2HD #rts #clem #maxpax{% endraw %}
