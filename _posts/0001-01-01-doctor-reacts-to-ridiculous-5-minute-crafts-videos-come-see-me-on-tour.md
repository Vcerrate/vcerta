{% raw %}COME SEE ME ON TOUR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.doctormikelive.com">http://www.doctormikelive.com</a><br /><br />5 Minute Crafts is one of the most successful channels on YouTube, highlighting tips and tricks to improve small parts of your every day life. Over the years they’ve made a few videos about first aid and health hacks that I couldn’t let slide. Some of this is so painful to watch and unnecessary. Today we talk about the many uses for tampons, giving children medicine and shots, activated charcoal as toothpaste, the multi faceted possibilities of normal toothpaste, coca cola, a ton of remedies for scrapes, and other tricks that Five Minute Crafts really think are necessary. Have you tried any of these? Did they work for you?<br /><br />I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously. If there’s a subject you want me to discuss or something you’d like for me to react to, leave a comment down below. Many of my videos have been born out of suggestions directly from you, so don’t hold back!<br />-Doctor Mike Varshavski<br /><br />Help us continue the fight against medical misinformation and change the world through charity by becoming a Doctor Mike Resident on Patreon where every month I donate 100% of the proceeds to the charity, organization, or cause of your choice!
