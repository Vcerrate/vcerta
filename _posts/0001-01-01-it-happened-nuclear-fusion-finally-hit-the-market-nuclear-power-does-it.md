{% raw %}Nuclear power! Does it make you squirm? The fact is, depending on where you are, the<br />power supplied to your apartment may come from a nuclear reactor, even if you don't<br />want one to be sited behind your house! However, scientists continue to look for ways<br />to make nuclear reactors better, and a breakthrough by a company working on nuclear<br />fusion promises to change everything! What is nuclear fusion, what company has made<br />the breakthrough, and how does the breakthrough affect you as a person?<br />The total energy consumption in the world amounts to about 13 terawatt year. The<br />average consumption per capita is about 2.2 kilowatt year, but there are vast disparities<br />among different countries. For example, the US has a per capita of 11 kilowatt year; the<br />EU 5 kilowatt year; China, 0.8 kilowatt year; and India, 0.3 kilowatt year. The richest 20<br />percent of the world population uses 55 percent of the primary energy, and their per<br />capita consumption is almost five times as much as the rest of the world's population.<br />Where does all that energy come from? The world generated a record 10 percent of its<br />electricity from wind and solar in 2021, 59 percent from coal. Around 10 percent of the<br />world's electricity last year came from about 440 nuclear power reactors. About 55 more<br />reactors are under construction, equivalent to approximately 15 percent of existing<br />capacity!{% endraw %}
