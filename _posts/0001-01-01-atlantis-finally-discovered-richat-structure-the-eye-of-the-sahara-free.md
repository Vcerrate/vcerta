It is scoffed at by some and pursued with a zealous fervor by others. Atlantis has been a topic of debate among scholars and historians for centuries. A mighty empire, technologically advanced in science and engineering, wealthy beyond measure, and a military superpower. <br /><br />Could they have existed in the past? Is it possible that such a civilization could be forgotten? Did the winds of time distort our perception of human history? The evidence indicates that this is indeed what has happened. If this is true, how could a culture so significant be forgotten?<br /><br />If you want to learn more about Atlantis and the Richat Structure, check out the channel of Bright Insight, who has a compilation of videos on this topic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BrightInsight">https://www.youtube.com/c/BrightInsight</a><br /><br />Check our articles: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://universe-inside-you.com">https://universe-inside-you.com</a><br />Support us on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/universeinsideyou">https://www.patreon.com/universeinsideyou</a><br /><br />Narration: Petra Ortiz - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://petraortiz.com">http://petraortiz.com</a><br /><br />T-Shirts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/universe-inside-you-2">https://teespring.com/stores/universe-inside-you-2</a><br />All lost robot-voiced videos can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://subscribestar.com/universe-inside-you">https://subscribestar.com/universe-inside-you</a><br /><br />ðŸ’œ Subscribe and like if you enjoyed the video.
