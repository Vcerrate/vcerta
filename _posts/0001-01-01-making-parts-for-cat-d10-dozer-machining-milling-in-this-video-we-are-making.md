{% raw %}In this video we are making Equalizer Bar Ends to go on a Caterpillar D10 Dozer. The bar ends are used as replacements when an equalizer bar gets damaged. We have four to make and show the step by step process to turn high tensile plate into the completed parts. We start with machining and boring the parts on the lathe and also cut the snap ring grooves. Then itâ€™s over to the milling machine for face cutting, drilling and tapping of the holes for the grease ports. The parts are finished off with a clean up &amp; anti-rust spray. We will be keeping one of the completed ends for an upcoming repair job so keep your eye out for that!<br /><br />In this video we are using: <br />- Hafco TM-26120G Lathe<br />- Hafco BM-63VE Milling machine<br /><br />Join our channel:<br />We upload new videos every Friday at 5pm AEST!
