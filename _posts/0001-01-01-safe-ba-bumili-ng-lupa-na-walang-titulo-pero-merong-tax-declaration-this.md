{% raw %}This is a new segment or playlist &quot;YOUR QUESTION, MY ANSWER&quot;. This is the question of Angelic Shayne Baculan asking if SAFE BA BUMILI NG LUPA NA WALANG TITULO PERO MAY TAX DECLARATION. <br />I decided to cerate this segment to cater the questions of my subscribers and viewers, and I choose relevant questions relating to real estate problems, such as, land titling, taxes, amelyar or tax declaration issues, encroachment or overlapping of boundaries, deed of sale problems, succession, heirs or mga mana issues, land titling process, geodetic relocation survey  and other surveys, right of way, road widening and all related property and real estate issues or problems. <br />As I have said, my purpose in creating video lectures is to share my legal knowledge in Real Estate matters and to help and solve some intricacies in the real estate transactions.  I have no purpose in promoting my practices as a Lawyer and Real Estate Broker nor I am trying to solicit clients. <br />My passion is to teach and share my knowledge without any expectation of any reward or fee.<br /><br />The lecture series are focused on real estate matters that would include different laws or provisions of law such as: <br /><br />1. Law on Property <br />2. Family Code<br />3. Succession <br />4. Corporation Law <br />5. Rules of Court <br />6. Law on Sales. lease and mortgages<br />7. Special laws  <br /><br />Since the lectures are for academic purposes, I would be thankful to receive any comments that would further enlighten and  present new ideas or solutions. <br /><br />Thank you !<br /><br />#raymondbatu<br />#amelyar <br />#taxdeclaration <br />#taxes <br />#landtitling<br />#duediligence <br />#taxdec{% endraw %}
