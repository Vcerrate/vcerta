{% raw %}hey yall!!!!! This is experimental so let me know what you think!! I wanted to do a video where I combined a few things together - repetition, pattern setting/breaking, face touching, etc.! If repeating things bugs you this might not be for you, but I haven't done one in a long time! It also kind of gives me over-explaining vibes too?? But I'm just doing a bunch of unexplained, bizarre tasks on your face! :D I also had the one trigger in an OLD video that someone requested that I put in my ultra rare series, which was the counting to 10 then circle then boop; so it reminded me of THAT as well...! Hahaha. <br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />ðŸŽµNew Spotify tracks every Monday! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/56r9ccCkwBCSDHIYviwhcv">https://open.spotify.com/artist/56r9ccCkwBCSDHIYviwhcv</a><br />And Apple Music! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/gibi-asmr/1373500921">https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/gibi-asmr/1373500921</a><br />AAAND Soundcloud! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/gibiasmr">https://soundcloud.com/gibiasmr</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />My upload schedule:<br />â–ºNew Spotify audio every Monday<br />â–ºASMR YouTube Video every Tuesday at 6pm Eastern<br />â–ºASMR YouTube Video every Thursday at 6pm Eastern<br />â–ºSponsored ASMR Video Every Saturday at 6pm Eastern<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I donate regularly to The Brain and Behavior Research Foundation.
