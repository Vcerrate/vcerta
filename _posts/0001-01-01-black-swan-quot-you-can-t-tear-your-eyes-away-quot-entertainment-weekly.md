{% raw %}&quot;You can't tear your eyes away&quot; (Entertainment Weekly) from this &quot;wicked, psychosexual thriller&quot; (Daily Variety) starring ACADEMY AWARDÂ® WINNER Natalie Portman* and directed by Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler ). Portman delivers &quot;the performance of her career&quot; (Vanity Fair ) as Nina, a stunningly talented but dangerously unstable ballerina on the verge of stardom. Pushed to the breaking point by her driven artistic director (Vincent Cassel) and the threat posed by a seductive rival dancer (Mila Kunis), Nina's tenuous grip on reality starts to slip away -- plunging her into a waking nightmare. *Actress, Black Swan, 2010{% endraw %}
