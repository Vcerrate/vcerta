{% raw %}Swedish Massage is what most people generally think of as a traditional massage, focusing on relaxation and overall well-being.  It energizes the body by stimulating circulation, is performed unclothed to the client’s level of comfort, and uses oil or lotion.  Swedish massage increases oxygen in the blood, and decreases muscle toxins.  The softer, non-aggressive approach of Swedish Massage can be wonderfully stress relieving and therapeutic.<br /><br />Deep Tissue massage is a therapy based on Swedish Massage techniques, using deeper pressure to release chronic tension, focusing on the deepest layers of muscle tissue, tendons and fascia.   Pressure is applied progressively as muscles that need more work come under focus.  Trigger Point therapy is frequently coupled with Deep Tissue to address tight muscle groups and “knots.”<br /><br />To schedule an appointment with a licensed massage therapist, or to learn more about College of DuPage’s program, visit cod.edu/massagetherapy, or call 630-942-2208.{% endraw %}
