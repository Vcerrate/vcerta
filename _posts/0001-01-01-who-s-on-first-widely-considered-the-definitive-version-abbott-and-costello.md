{% raw %}This is the classic Abbott and Costello comedy routine WHO'S ON FIRST?<br /><br />They began using this routine from the start of their career and continually refined it over the years, performing it in movies, on television, on radio and in theaters before live audiences.<br /><br />This version is from &quot;The Actors Home&quot; episode (1953) from &quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot; TV series. Wikipedia states that this performance is &quot;widely considered the definitive version&quot;, and I agree.<br /><br />ðŸ˜‹  P.S. - Please click the SUBSCRIBE Button ðŸ˜‰ and the LIKE Button ðŸ˜‹{% endraw %}
