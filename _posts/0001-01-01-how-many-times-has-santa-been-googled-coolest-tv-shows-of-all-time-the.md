{% raw %}The CliffCentral research team is working overtime, as they find out how many times people have Googled whether Santa is real. Lebang wants to know how best to break the news that the tooth fairy isn't real to her kids... and did you know that being messy and swearing is a sign of intelligence?<br /><br />Leigh-Ann has a sensitive tummy, Lebang was lied to at a church camp about calamari rings being made from a pigâ€™s butt, and Penny Stein answers the age-old question of milk or tea first.{% endraw %}
