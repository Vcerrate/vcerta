In particular, immigration to Ireland on investor visas and entrepreneur visas. I cover Ireland's announcement of its residency program for immigrant investors. In this video I explain how you can migrate to Ireland by investing ‚Ç¨50,000 euros of your own money in your own business, in a new company in Ireland, to get permanent residence and Irish citizenship for you and your family after 5 years through the start-up immigration entrepreneur programme for Ireland. We will look at a real Irish immigration case study to show how you how it works. <br />The purpose of the Start-up Entrepreneur visa in Ireland is to let you and your family get residency status and migrate to Ireland through setting up a so-called high-potential Irish start up business. <br /><br />You can apply to migrate to Ireland by yourself, or with your family. <br /><br />You and your family will be granted residence in Ireland for two years, which is renewable for a further three years. After 5 years' residence, you will be eligible for long term residence in the Ireland and you can then apply to the Irish immigration authorities for Irish citizenship, and become EU citizens. <br /><br />As for the immigration requirements in Ireland under this route: <br /><br />You need ‚Ç¨50,000 to invest. This can be:<br />Your own money<br />A business loan <br />Business Angel funding<br />Venture Capital funding or<br />a grant from an Irish State Agency<br />If you have business partners who also want residency under the program, then they only need to demonstrate access to ‚Ç¨30,000 each to qualify and migrate to Ireland.<br /><br />The briefing in this video provides a brief overview only of immigration to Ireland and is not (and is not a substitute for) legal or tax advice. Expert, tailored legal, commercial, immigration and tax advice should be taken which takes into account your particular circumstances. Always take legal advice on your individual circumstances.
