{% raw %}In this episode I describe how our brain and nervous system control muscle tissue and how to leverage that for muscle maintenance, growth (hypertrophy) and recovery. I explain muscle metabolism and muscle fiber recruitment. I detail protocols for increasing muscular growth and for neuro-muscular recovery. I explain the effects of deliberate cold, anti-inflammatory agents, and anti-histamines on training progress. I describe science-supported protocols using certain weight load ranges, total sets per week, training intensity, frequency, and in-between set activities if one's goal is to increase muscle growth, strength or endurance. I review three foundational compounds and nutrients and three optimization compounds and nutrients that have been shown to improve neuro-muscular performance. Finally, I explain how to leverage exercise and weight training to enhance cognitive function.<br /><br />Thank you to our sponsors<br />InsideTracker - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a> <br />Belcampo - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://belcampo.com/huberman">https://belcampo.com/huberman</a>  <br />Headspace - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://headspace.com/specialoffer">https://headspace.com/specialoffer</a><br /><br />Our Patreon page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman">https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman</a><br /><br />Supplements from Thorne:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman">http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman</a><br /><br />Social:<br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab">https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hubermanlab">https://twitter.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab">https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab</a><br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.com">https://hubermanlab.com</a><br />Join the Neural Network: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network">https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />00:00:00 Introduction <br />00:10:58 Protocol For Fat Loss: (Zero-Cost) PDF Available At: thecoldplunge.com<br />00:12:45 Muscle Is A Slave To the Nervous System<br />00:16:22 Why We Have A Brain<br />00:17:38 Flexors, Extensors, &amp; Mutual Inhibition<br />00:20:00 How Muscles Move, Making &amp; Using Muscle Energy: Making ATP<br />00:23:29 The “Burn” Is Not Lactic Acid.
