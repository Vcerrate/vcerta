{% raw %}Since the moon doesn't have an atmosphere, there's no wind or water to erode or wash away the Apollo astronauts' mark on the moon. That means their footprints, rover prints, spaceship prints, and discarded materials will stay preserved on the moon for a very long time. üë®‚ÄçüöÄüåù<br /><br />They won't stay on there forever, though. The moon still has a dynamic environment, which means erosion is happening on the moon, just very slowly. ‚åõ Found this interesting? <br />Download the #PracticallyApp now and follow us for more such content. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rb.gy/xvvskr">https://rb.gy/xvvskr</a><br /><br />Don't just learn, learn Practically!<br /><br />Download the app now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rb.gy/xvvskr">https://rb.gy/xvvskr</a><br />To know more, visit our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.practically.com/">https://www.practically.com/</a><br />Also, you can call us on 9126555999 for a Free Expert Counselling session.<br /><br />#BringLearningAlive #LearningApp #ScienceStudent #MoonFacts #Moon #Footprints #Astronauts #ScienceFacts #DidYouKnow #LearnPractically #Elearning<br /><br />Facebook:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PracticallyApp">https://www.facebook.com/PracticallyApp</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/practicallyapp/">https://www.instagram.com/practicallyapp/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/practicallyapp">https://twitter.com/practicallyapp</a>{% endraw %}
