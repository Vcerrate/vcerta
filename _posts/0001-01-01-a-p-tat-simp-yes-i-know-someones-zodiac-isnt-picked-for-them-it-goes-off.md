{% raw %}yes, i know someones zodiac isnt picked for them, it goes off your birth month and birthday. <br /><br />just wanna point this out, Gemini's arent 2 faced like ppl make us out to be, some of them are, i won't lie. but most of us arent, we just create different personalities to go with the person we're hanging out with, its that simple <br /><br />im prob gonna upset ppl by saying that, and i honestly dont mind, cause thats the truth, not all of us are what we're made out to be<br /><br />thats all i have, hope you enjoyed! (if you didnt, thats alr) have an awesome rest of your day/night/afternoon!! ^^ <br /><br />where my Gemini's at?? ♊💕<br /><br />💫𝐂𝐨𝐩𝐲𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐫:💫<br />Copyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.
