And because of that, it's the reason that a monotherapy or a one drug approach to Alzheimer's, for example, is beyond myopic. It's never going to work.” [03:02]<br /><br />“Our metabolic health globally is in a terrible place. I mean, a third of American adults have hypertension, and 10% of kids aged 12 to 18 have hypertension. That's crazy. 50% of adult Americans will be obese by the year 2030. Not just overweight, but obese.” [04:16]<br /><br />“Elevation of uric acid is associated with an 80% increased risk of dementia, a 55% increase risk of Alzheimer's specifically, and a 165% increased risk of vascular dementia.” [13:53]<br /><br />“What would be the upside of having uric acid create insulin resistance, and therefore cause blood sugar to go up? Why? Because when you're starving, it'll help power your brain.” [16:50]<br /><br />“What we're seeing now are these metabolic derangements that underlie these diseases that represent a disconnect between evolution and environment.” [22:06]<br /><br />“If it has a barcode, and it's in the grocery store, it has added sweetener - 70% do. And by and large that comes from high fructose, there's the villain corn syrup that we subsidize to the tune of $500 billion a year.” [25:01]<br /><br />“Uric acid levels are climbing in lockstep with fructose consumption. In the 1920s, average uric acid level in Americans was about 3.5 - it's now six.” [46:50]<br /><br /><br />Follow Dr. David Perlmutter:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drperlmutter.com">https://www.drperlmutter.com</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3GRK37j">https://bit.ly/3GRK37j</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3Bkb8yZ">https://bit.ly/3Bkb8yZ</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3swlmYY">https://bit.ly/3swlmYY</a> <br />Order Dr. Perlmutter’s new book, Drop Acid: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3HQykY5">https://amzn.to/3HQykY5</a>{% endraw %}
