{% raw %}An unbiased review of Each &amp; Every Deodorant, including the ingredient list, info on its active ingredients, and my experience using it, including how effective I've found it to be, my opinion of the formulation and texture of the deodorant, and my overall rating.<br /><br />Since recording this, Iâ€™ve purchased two of their newest scents, geranium and snow mushroom, and white chamomille and bergamot, and I recommend both of them. They both have tart scents. The first is a peppery lemony scent, and the second smells like a lime creamsicle and is my favorite!<br /><br /><br />Like, comment, and subscribe! I will be making more of these natural deodorant reviews, so definitely subscribe so you don't miss any. I also have a video on how to successfully make the switch from aluminum containing deodorant to natural deodorant, and here's the link for that: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/FO6GPb4s4hw">https://youtu.be/FO6GPb4s4hw</a><br /><br />Filmed in 4K on my iPhone X, edited with Wondershare Filmora X (lots of X's going on!){% endraw %}
