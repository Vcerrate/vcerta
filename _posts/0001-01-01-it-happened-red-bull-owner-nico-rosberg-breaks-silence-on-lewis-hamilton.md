{% raw %}Max Verstappen is easily the most polarizing figure in Formula 1 right now. For a <br />big part of the 2021 season, Max Verstappen looked like the favorite to win the <br />championship and end the dominance of Mercedes drivers during the hybrid era <br />in the process. Lewis Hamilton in particular was the chief benefactor of this <br />dominance as his own driving skills coupled with the car's superiority allowed <br />him to win 6 championships in the previous 7 years putting him on the same <br />level as Michael Schumacher in terms of Championships and making him the <br />most prolific rider in terms of wins and a few other records.<br />The season started with Red Bull and Max Verstappen being the favorites and <br />this was further reinforced when Mercedes stated that they were concentrating <br />fully on their 2022 car. This was, however, a bluff as Mercedes did bring <br />upgrades to their 2021 car and this swung the advantage back in favor of <br />Mercedes. This was in perfect display during the Brazilian Grand Prix when Lewis <br />Hamilton overtook the entire field over the course of the sprint race and the <br />main race to produce his most dominant victory ever.<br />With three races to go, Verstappen's lead in the championship was reduced to 14<br />points. This number would prove incredibly crucial as that is exactly twice the 7-<br />points difference between the first and second-place finishes in a race. Lewis <br />would win the next two races and with Max getting the fastest lap in Qatar and <br />Lewis doing the same in Saudi Arabia, they arrived tied on points for the season <br />finale. An entire season of close battles, controversies, and harsh words would <br />simply be decided by who finished ahead of the other at the end of the Abu <br />Dhabi Grand Prix.{% endraw %}
