{% raw %}Four Oaths, Shri Ganesha Puja 1984 092, Riffelberg, Switzerland<br />&quot;I come to you as a symbol of your Mother, but the first son who was created was Shri Ganesh. And then, when the Mother Earth was created as a symbol of motherhood, She created many Shri Ganeshas in this universe. In the cosmos, the star which is called as Mars, is Shri Ganesha. All these symbols were created for you, the Sahaja Yogis to recognize them. To recognize all these symbols is easier if you are a realized soul. But we have had so many great realized souls in the past, of very high quality and they recognized, they found out the symbols of Shri Ganesha, long time back.<br />India is the microscopic form of the whole earth, Mother Earth.&quot;{% endraw %}
