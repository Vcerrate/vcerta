Speaking about the new release, Substantial shares, “Your Greatest Weapon is about self-empowerment and realizing that the most powerful weapon that we have is our voice.” 'YGW's' production is a chill midtempo groove, filled with smooth bass, rhythm guitar, chopped drum, and clarinet samples, and expertly-played vibraphone courtesy of Malcolm Jackson. MLLN's jazzy vocals are the icing on this delicious Jazz-Hop cake. <br /><br />:: LYRICS ::<br />(MLLN)<br />If you ever doubted me<br />I could make you regret everything<br />Time to lift my voice and sing<br />It's the greatest weapon I can bring<br />Greatest Weapon!<br /><br />(Substantial)<br />Here to put a stop to the anguish<br />But they don’t understand like I’m speaking a dead language<br />Devoured big beef ‘fore I was ever fed angus<br />Went to battle with friends then mourned for dead strangers<br />I was bred dangerous but peace is the objective<br />Easily subjective to the heathens I connect with<br />Seem to be respected ‘mongst the beast in my collective<br />Ignored by the masses so I speak for the rejected<br />And the speakers are connected just to amplify our voice<br />They ain’t built for the journey but I never had a choice<br />Doubt is louder than cheers but I’m drowning out the noise<br />They don’t know who we be like DMX and Dubois<br />So to those who ain’t been informed<br />I am fire in a winter storm, first blooming flower when the winter’s gone<br />Solitude sang by Sarah Vaughn, every note is integral<br />And great’s the minimum... when the pressure’s on<br /><br />(MLLN)<br />If you ever doubted me (ah ahhh)<br />I could make you regret everything (regret everything)<br />Time to lift my voice and sing (ooh ooh)<br />It's the greatest weapon I can bring<br />Greatest Weapon!<br /><br />(Substantial)<br />Heart on my sleeve, dirt in my claws, eyes on the prize<br />Sharpen my teeth on food for thought, pride on the side<br />Guarding the weak, put up my paws, lives on the line<br />Call of the beast, no matter the cost, I’m fine with the fines<br />Inclined to find a way when there ain’t one in view<br />Trying to climb but can’t save every one of you<br />This kind of design is made just for a humble few.<br />Some don’t mind the mines and lose no matter what I do<br />I do what hunters do, fam I love, prey, and eat<br />And the tongue that I speak is a drum in a beat<br />That’s guiding you thru the rhythm of life if you dare to dance<br />Out here shining light to help people lift out of their trance<br />King checked by pawns and a knight and can’t advance<br />Til we rearrange the game and opponents shit in their pants<br />Strength in our stance, pens in our hands looking like weapons<br />Those that overstand what we saying, they see the blessing<br /><br />(Br'er)<br />Music is the entity that forged angels<br />Sing a song only few will understand<br />And it shall be your greatest weapon<br /><br />(MLLN)<br />If you ever doubted me (ah ahhh)<br />I could make you regret everything (regret everything)<br />Time to lift my voice and sing (ooh ooh)<br />It's the greatest weapon I can bring<br />Greatest Weapon!<br /><br />:: ABOUT ANIMAL ARITHMETIC ::<br />Animal Arithmetic (AA) is an end-times story - a call to introspection - in the form of manga, animation, and Jazz-Hop. Animal Arithmetic's creator, Queens native, Kenya “KDFoxx” Danino is an illustrator, writer, and former mentee of acclaimed storytellers Peter De Seve, Terryl Whitlatch, Thomas Astruc, and Hiroyuki Asada.
