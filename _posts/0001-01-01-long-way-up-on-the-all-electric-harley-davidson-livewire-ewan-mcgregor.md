{% raw %}If you have been keeping up with this trip so far you know Ewan and Charley were taking electric bikes on this journey.  The Harley Davidson Livewire seemed like an unusual choice and a major departure from their typical GS beasts.  I am excited to see how they were able to make their miles based on the HD specs for the Livewire but only time will tell.  Leave a comment and let me know if you think they are going to tell us about what support, if any, was necessary for this trip to become a reality.<br /><br />Here is the article by Sabrina Giacomini and the accompanying video with Jimmy Fallon and Ewan McGregor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rideapart.com/articles/396492/interview-ewan-mcgregor-long-way-up/">https://www.rideapart.com/articles/396492/interview-ewan-mcgregor-long-way-up/</a><br /><br />Be Gone For Good is built around the philosophy of bringing the greatest benefit we can while we travel.
