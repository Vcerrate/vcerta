{% raw %}A solid concrete dwelling, The Hopetoun is a luxury super house, complete with a tennis court and sleek garage. Meticulously designed by FGR Architects, the new build combines architecture, lighting and textural detail to reveal internal spaces of surprising delicacy.  <br /><br />Located in the leafy Melbourne suburb of Toorak, The Hopetoun is a super house designed to accommodate a large family. Situated on the corner of a road, the house is crafted to dramatically embrace the breadth of its site, presenting a broad and expansive façade to the street.<br /><br />A house tour of the property sheds light on the layout of the super house, carefully planned by the architect. FGR Architects configures the home to maximise solar penetration via the northern aspect, fitting the sunlit side of the house with ample glazing and arranging the internal spaces to reflect the need for natural light. Whilst the southern orientation houses utilities and services, the northern counterpart is occupied by the most frequently habited rooms. A sculptural set of stairs forms the highlight of the interior design. <br /><br />FGR Architects uses lighting to express the structural prowess of the concrete super house, including the implemented overhangs within the architecture. The delicate interaction between the undulating texture of the concrete walls and the warm wash of artificial light presents lighting almost as a material in itself, equal amongst the concrete, glass, stone and timber. <br /><br />Utilising the refined nature of concrete in relation to light, FGR Architects is able to create a sophisticated super house that possesses the robust material character to age elegantly through time.  <br /><br />00:00 - Introduction to the Super House<br />00:27 - Entering the Super House<br />01:21 - Minimalist Architecture <br />01:57 - Connection Between Spaces<br />02:19 - Positioning the House <br />02:59 - Lighting in the House<br />03:40 - Concrete Architecture <br />04:37 - Utilising Stone and Timber<br />04:54 - Breaking Tradition <br /><br />For more from The Local Project: <br /><br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/">https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/</a> <br />Website – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/</a> <br />Print Publication – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/</a> <br />The Local Project Marketplace – Marketplace - The Local Project<br /><br />To subscribe to The Local Project's Tri-Annual Print Publication see here – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/</a> <br /><br />Architecture and Interior Design by FGR Architects. <br />Photography by Peter Bennetts.<br />Filmed and Edited by Cheer Squad Film Co.<br />Production by The Local Project.<br /><br />Musicbed SyncID: MB01EJZHEPA6QLG<br /><br />#SuperHouse #Architecture #HouseTour #InteriorDesign #DreamHome #House #Home #Architect #InteriorDesigner #DreamHouse #Design{% endraw %}
