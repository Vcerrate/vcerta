We are going to photograph wildlife with some new equipment and there will be a film crew covering the 5 days.<br />I went to Scotland 6 days in advance to visit the Cairngorms to try my luck with the mountain hares but I did not see any.<br />I met up with my friend Joanna and we used her campervan as a basecamp for 3 days. <br />Together with her, I spent a few days in Glen Etive trying to photograph the Stags. They were very skittish though so I had to use my car as a photo blind. <br /><br />After saying goodbye to Joanna I headed to another location to meet up with Ricci from Nikon School, Beyond Content and a Nikon PR representative. <br />Together we spent five days photographing landscapes, wildlife and trying out the new Nikon Z 400mm f/2,8.<br /><br />I did some interview for the Nikon YouTube Channel and for Nikon Scool.<br /><br /><br />✦ WHO I AM. <br /><br />My name is Morten Hilmer and I am a professional nature and wildlife photographer. <br />I am a Nikon Ambassador and I work as an ILCP photographer. <br />Nature conservation is very close to my heart. <br />I have served in the Danish military special unit, the Sirius Patrol, for two years and that has given me the skills and confidence to operate alone in the arctic regions. <br /> <br /><br />See you out there !<br /><br />All the best<br />Morten Hilmer{% endraw %}
