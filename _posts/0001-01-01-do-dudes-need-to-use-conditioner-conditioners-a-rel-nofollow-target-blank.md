Do men need to use conditioner? Here's the short answer... YES. <br /><br />The key rule to know is: Shampoo Less, Condition More. Conditioners help by restoring all the things that shampoos take away. Conditioners make your hair sexy, soft, strong, and healthy! If your hair does get a bit oily if you use a conditioner regularly, condition a tad less, no biggie. Otherwise, conditioning almost daily will make your hair bueno!{% endraw %}
