{% raw %}The 2023 Nissan Z has a 400-hp twin-turbo V-6. It's roughly the same price as the Ford Mustang GT 5.0 and Toyota Supra, so let's answer the $50,000 question: Which one makes it through the quarter-mile first?<br /><br />The 2023 Z Sport starts at $41,015 (with destination) but this is the $51,015 Z Performance, which comes with wider tires and a limited-slip differential. It's likely that the base car will be slower due to the rear-wheel traction differential.<br /><br />For the first race, with Jason Cammisa's now-iconic frozen-time slow-mo walkback, we have the 2023 Nissan Z with a 9-speed automatic transmission battling a 10-speed Ford Mustang Mach-1 and an 8-speed Toyota GR Supra 3.0.<br /><br />Instrumented Testing Results are as follows:<br />1. 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-1 (automatic)<br /> 0-60 mph = 3.8 sec<br /> 1/4 mile = 12.1 sec @ 120 mph<br /><br />2. 2022 Toyota GR Supra 3.0<br /> 0-60 mph = 3.8 sec<br /> 1/4 mile = 12.1 sec @ 117 mph<br /><br />3. 2023 Nissan Z (Performance package) (automatic)<br /> 0-60 mph = 4.0 sec<br /> 1/4 mile = 12.3 sec @ 116 mph<br /><br />For the second race, we have the 9-speed automatic Z versus the Z 6-speed manual.<br /><br />Instrumented Testing Results are as follows:<br />1. 2023 Nissan Z (Performance package) (automatic)<br /> 0-60 mph = 4.0 sec<br /> 1/4 mile = 12.3 sec @ 116 mph<br /><br />2. 2023 Nissan Z (Performance package) (6MT)<br /> 0-60 mph = 4.3 sec<br /> 1/4 mile = 12.8 sec @ 112 mph<br /><br /><br />And for the bonus round, we have a 2010 Aston Martin V8 Vantage 4.7, which is almost exactly the same size, weight, horsepower, and torque as the New Z. <br /><br />1. 2010 Aston Martin V8 Vantage 4.7 6-speed manual<br /> 0-60 mph = 4.4 sec<br /> 1/4 mile = 12.7 @ 112 mph<br /><br />2. 2023 Nissan Z (Performance package) (6MT)<br /> 0-60 mph = 4.3 sec<br /> 1/4 mile = 12.8 sec @ 112 mph<br /><br />Please be sure to watch the full episode for Jason's explanation of why the Z didn't quite keep up, and why the manual-transmission Z is quieter than the automatic.<br /><br />===<br /><br />CHAPTERS:<br />0:00 The $50,000 straight-line drag race<br />0:24 Jason Cammisa's Ultimate Drag Race Replay<br />0:28 The Ford Mustang Mach-1 5.0 Automatic<br />0:34 The Toyota GR Supra 3.0 Automatic<br />0:41 The 2023 Nissan Z can't do a burnout<br />0:59 Z vs Supra vs Mustang standing start<br />1:34 Race Results: Nissan Z is right behind the Supra and Mustang<br />3:24 Manual Z vs Automatic Z — exhaust differences<br />4:04 Manual Z vs Automatic Z — drag race<br />4:34 Race Results: automatic vs manual Z<br />5:05 2023 Nissan Z vs. Aston Martin V8 Vantage 4.7<br />5:46 Conclusion — Z needs grippier tires!<br /><br /><br />===<br /><br />Subscribe to our YouTube channel for new videos every day! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube">http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube</a> <br /><br />Visit our website for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hagerty.com/media">https://www.hagerty.com/media</a> <br /><br />Stay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/">https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/</a> <br /><br />Talk to other car people on our community: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://community.hagerty.com/">https://community.hagerty.com/</a> <br /><br />Follow us on social media:<br />Facebook | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty">https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty</a> <br />Instagram | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/Hagerty">https://instagram.com/Hagerty</a> <br />Twitter | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Hagerty">https://twitter.com/Hagerty</a> <br /><br />If you love cars, you belong with us.
