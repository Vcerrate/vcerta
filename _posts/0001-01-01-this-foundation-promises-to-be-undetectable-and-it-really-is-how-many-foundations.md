HOWEVER this one (make up for ever HD SKIN) promises to be undetectable on the skin. And I didn't believe it for one moment. And then I tried it. The claim is true, with two pumps, using a sponge, this really does give a skin like finish. It offers light / medium coverage with a matte finish. <br /><br />MAKE UP FOR EVER UD SKIN LINKS<br />UK <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gurumakeupemporium.com/products/hd-skin-foundation">https://www.gurumakeupemporium.com/products/hd-skin-foundation</a><br />US <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/33yByR5">https://bit.ly/33yByR5</a><br /><br />What it is: An undetectable liquid foundation that blurs and covers imperfections for up to 24 hours, powered by a micro-skin system that syncs with the skin for true-to-skin finish.<br /><br />Coverage: Medium <br /><br />Finish: Natural <br /><br />Formulation: Liquid <br /><br />Highlighted Ingredients: <br />- Micro-Skin System™: Follows skin movement, provides immediate high correction, and smooths skin.<br />- Vegetable-Origin Glycerol: Helps to preserve the initial moisturizing of the skin during 24-hour period.<br />- Exopolysaccharide: Helps for radiance of complexion during 24-hour period.<br /><br />Ingredient Callouts: Free of parabens, formaldehydes, formaldehyde-releasing agents, phthalates, mineral oil, retinyl palmitate, oxybenzone, coal tar, hydroquinone, sulfates SLS &amp; SLES, triclocarban, triclosan, and contains less than one percent synthetic fragrance.
