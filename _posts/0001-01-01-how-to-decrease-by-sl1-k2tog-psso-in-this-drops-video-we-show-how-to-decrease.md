{% raw %}In this DROPS video we show how to decrease by sl1, k2tog, psso.<br /><br />These abbreviations in the title means slip 1 stitch as if to knit, knit 2 sts together, pass the slipped stitch over.<br />This is a decrease from 3 sts into 1. Also used in lace patterns and with a yo on each side, so number of sts are kept the same, but 2 holes are created.<br /><br />This video has NO SOUND - you must read the pattern to be able to follow this video properly.
