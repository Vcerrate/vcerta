{% raw %}Like this prayer, which we sing every Shabbat, peace is often assumed or taken for granted. Sometimes it is only when peace is threatened that its importance comes into high relief – our fondest hopes are for peace to spread over us as the sukkat sh’lomeha. This Presidents’ Day weekend, we hope that governments everywhere strive for the peace for which we all pray.<br /><br />Music: Zina Goldrich, arr.
