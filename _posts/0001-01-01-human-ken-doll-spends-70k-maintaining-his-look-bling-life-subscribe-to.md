{% raw %}SUBSCRIBE to Truly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj">http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj</a><br /><br />JONATHAN DYLAN is Canada’s very own Human Ken Doll and has spent over CA$70,000 and rising to achieve his perfect look. Jonathan regularly spends around $3,500 a month on his beauty regime, and cosmetic procedures. He also adores designer handbags, and has spent over $36,000 on his collection. As an actor, TV personality, recording artist and social media influencer, he is no stranger to a bling and glamorous lifestyle. He wants to be the next big global star and looking good is the most important thing to him. Jonathan told Truly: “I originally came into the industry as a backup dancer and I met music executives and producers and that was when I was scouted to have my own song.&quot; Using that as a springboard into the limelight, Jonathan is never one to rest on his laurels. Quietly he has been working on some exciting business ventures, primarily his very own lip gloss range. Today, he is meeting with his best friend Tess to finally share the news he has been keeping tightly under wraps. <br /><br />Follow Jonathan here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jonathandylan/">https://www.instagram.com/jonathandylan/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jonnykendoll">https://www.tiktok.com/@jonnykendoll</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JonnyKenDollOfficial/featured">https://www.youtube.com/c/JonnyKenDollOfficial/featured</a> <br /><br />Videographer: Kyle Sandilands<br />Producers: Joel Ross, Becky Robinson<br />Editor: Joshua Brown<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
