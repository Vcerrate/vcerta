{% raw %}&quot;She is Toxic&quot; Jaden Smith Reveals Why Jada Smith Is Manipulating<br /><br />We have to admit that it’s pretty sad that when someone types Will Smith on google they will be hit with a bunch of articles about toxic masculinity at a time when he won an Oscars! Yikes! But apparently, there’s so much more to what led to him to slap Chris Rock  and it has a lot to do with Jada Smith hella manipulative and toxic! But where did all that talk come from? And did Jaden Smith  reveal anything about his mom being manipulative? <br /><br />As you may be well aware, Jada has always been very open about her and Will's relationship issues and she even had Will on her show to air grievances about their marriage on The Red Table Talk. Those sessions in particular were the origin of the ‘sad Will’ memes, and according to fans their entire marriage showed just how manipulative and toxic Jada has always been. But how does their son, Jaden, feel about everything?<br /><br />#jadensmith #willsmith #jadasmith{% endraw %}
