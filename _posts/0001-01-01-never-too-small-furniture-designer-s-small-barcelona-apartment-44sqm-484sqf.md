{% raw %}This episode is brought to you by our book, Never Too Small: Reimaging Small Space Living. Available now at our store <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nevertoosmall.com/store">https://www.nevertoosmall.com/store</a><br /><br />One of 6 small houses located inside a 19th Century villa in a peaceful neighborhood of Barcelona, owners Max and Diana removed several dividing walls of the apartment, keeping only one between the bedroom and living room, creating an open and functional space divided by custom built-in multifunctional furniture in muted yellow and gray. A unique bookshelf divides the entrance from the rest of the house, whilst a low joinery unit spanning the length of the left wall provides plenty of hidden storage and displays their collection of eclectic objects. This flows into the living room where a seamless furniture unit combines a sofa and dining table with a collapsible counter. On the opposite wall a desk is cleverly integrated into the kitchen joinery which also extends under the stairs to house the fridge, oven and laundry. The addition of an enclosed glass outdoor area, leading to a rooftop terrace, extends the living area and brings the outside into the villa all year round. <br /><br /><br />#smallapartment #architecture #interiordesign <br /><br />Music: Moment by John Gegleman<br /><br />Produced by New Mac Video Agency<br />Creator: Colin Chee<br />Director: Nam Tran<br />Cinematographer: Matthieu Torres<br />Producer: Lindsay Barnard<br />Editor: Jessica Ruasol{% endraw %}
