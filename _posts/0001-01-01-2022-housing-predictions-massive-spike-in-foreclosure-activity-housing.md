{% raw %}2022 Housing Predictions: Massive Spike in Foreclosure Activity - Housing Bubble 2.0<br /><br />Contrary to some of the statistical reporting that is going on these days, January 2022 saw a very significant increase in Foreclosure activity, as compared to the previous month and a year ago. Overall Foreclosure activity increased, which included Foreclosure filings, Auctions and REO sales. The Housing Market is dependent on an increase in Distressed Properties in order to alleviate Inventory and Pricing issues. The Housing Market should see a steady increase of Foreclosures as time goes on. <br /><br />This channel discusses recent articles, data and information about the Housing Bubble, Housing Crash, Home Prices, Forbearance, Foreclosures and Short Sales.<br /><br />Additionally there is a focus on Mortgage Delinquencies, Mortgage Rates,  FHA Loans, Real Estate Investing, and Housing Market Predictions for 2022 and Beyond. <br /><br />Today is February 11th 2022 and Randy will discuss the following topics:<br /><br />2022 Housing Market Predictions<br />Massive Spike in Foreclosure Activity <br /><br />Links:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.attomdata.com/news/market-trends/foreclosures/attom-january-2022-u-s-foreclosure-market-report/">https://www.attomdata.com/news/market-trends/foreclosures/attom-january-2022-u-s-foreclosure-market-report/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.attomdata.com/news/market-trends/figuresfriday/where-are-the-highest-concentrations-of-completed-foreclosures-in-early-2022/">https://www.attomdata.com/news/market-trends/figuresfriday/where-are-the-highest-concentrations-of-completed-foreclosures-in-early-2022/</a><br /><br />Need to See Foreclosure Data ?
