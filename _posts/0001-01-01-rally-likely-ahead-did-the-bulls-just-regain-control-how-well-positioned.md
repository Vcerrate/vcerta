Above and beyond the recent economic impacts of COVID, the new era of record low interest rates, runaway US debt and US deficits, and trillions of dollars in monetary and fiscal stimulus stimulus has changed the rules of investing by dangerously distorting the Dow index, the S&amp;P 500, and nearly all other asset prices. Can prices keep rising, or is there a painful reckoning ahead? <br /><br />Let us help you prepare your portfolio just in case the future brings one or more of the following: inflation, deflation, a bull market, a bear market, a market correction, a stock market crash, a real estate bubble, a real estate crash, an economic boom, a recession, a depression, or another global financial crisis.<br /><br />Put the wisdom from the money &amp; markets experts we feature on Wealthion into action by scheduling a free consultation with Wealthion’s endorsed financial advisors, who will work with you to determine the right next steps for you to take in building your wealth.<br /><br />SCHEDULE YOUR FREE WEALTH CONSULTATION with Wealthion's endorsed financial advisors here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wealthion.com/">https://www.wealthion.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to our YouTube channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKMeK-HGHfUFFArZ91rzv5A?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKMeK-HGHfUFFArZ91rzv5A?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Follow Adam on Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/menlobear">https://twitter.com/menlobear</a><br /><br />Follow us on Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Wealthion-109680281218040">https://www.facebook.com/Wealthion-109680281218040</a><br />____________________________________<br />IMPORTANT NOTE: The information and opinions offered in this video by Wealthion or its interview guests are for educational purposes ONLY and should NOT be construed as personal financial advice.
