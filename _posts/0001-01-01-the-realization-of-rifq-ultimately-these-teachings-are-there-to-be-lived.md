{% raw %}“Ultimately, these teachings are there to be lived.”<br /> <br />One of the great traits that our beloved Messenger ﷺ possessed—which on the surface may appear simple but in actuality is very deep—is Rifq (often translated as gentleness). <br /><br />In this khutba, Shaykh Yahya Rhodus explains the four deeper meanings contained in the word ‘Rifq’ and why, in these times, this trait is especially important to acquire. Part of the discussion includes a metaphor of a bee and the personal benefit of not demanding your rights from those who have wronged you on The Day of Judgment.{% endraw %}
