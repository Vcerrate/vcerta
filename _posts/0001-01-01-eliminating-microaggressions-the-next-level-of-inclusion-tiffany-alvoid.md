{% raw %}Microaggression is a term used for brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative prejudicial slights and insults toward any group.<br /><br />In this Talk Tiffany, lays out how this behavior manifests itself, the role you play, and what you can do to avoid perpetuating its continued existence in society. Tiffany Alvoid is an attorney.  She earned a JD from UCLA School of Law with a concentration in Critical Race Theory.  Tiffany created a training about addressing microaggressions in the workplace in an effort to create awareness about how destructive they can be in the workplace. Tiffanyâ€™s training focuses on the historical context that makes certain phrases offensive in an effort to help participants understand the unique perspective of marginalized groups.  Tiffany conducts the training for teams to help create a more inclusive and productive work environment.  Currently, Tiffany works at Twitter on their employee relations team. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
