{% raw %}Remarkable has sent me this link to use for my friends that gives £40 off the device, so if you would like to buy the Remarkable and get £40 off, please follow this link: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://remarkable.com/referral/3TRV-5EFR">https://remarkable.com/referral/3TRV-5EFR</a> <br /><br />P.S. I don't get anything for you using the link, so use it or don't use it, but as it saves £40 there should be no downside if you will buy the device anyway. <br /><br />Ok ok, so you know you need to get a life when you get excited about the 2.12 software update of the Remarkable 2. Still, it is exciting and will make a difference to how I, and I am sure many people will be able to use PDFs in meetings and in other applications like taking notes on an ebook or PDF. <br /><br />I hope you find this video helpful. It has been a while since I have been compelled to make a video on Remakbles software updates. If there are any questions, comments, or thoughts about Remakables software over recent months, please comment below.<br /><br />An update in the literally days since I filmed this video is that Remarkable has already moved this from a beta to a full release. However, this still might not be available immediately after the official rollout has started, as Remarkbales full rollout can take weeks to get to all devices.<br /><br />If you have liked this video, please hit the like button and if you have got down here, please also consider subscribing if you have not already joined me on this YouTube journey.<br /><br />0:00 Intro <br />1:08 Add Notes to PDF<br />2:15 PDF Demo<br />6:13 Onedrive<br />6:46 Improved Search<br />8:36 Summary{% endraw %}
