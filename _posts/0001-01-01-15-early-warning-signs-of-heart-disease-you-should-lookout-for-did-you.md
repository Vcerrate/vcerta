{% raw %}Did you know that heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the United States? Whatâ€™s shocking is that one person dies every 36 seconds from heart disease. Hi viewers and welcome back to another Bestie video!<br /><br />Heart issues do not happen immediately and they donâ€™t always come with warning bells like pain in the chest, breathlessness or palpitations. In fact, some symptoms start way before a heart attack or stroke occurs. This makes it difficult to identify the real issue. Knowing the early warning signs of heart disease can help you before itâ€™s too late. In todayâ€™s video, we will tell you early signs you may be at a risk for heart disease. <br /><br />Other videos recommended for you:<br /><br />WATCH ðŸŽ¥: 10 Body Changes That Need Your Attention - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5GkCGkF11U&amp;list=PL_fl96m7OLQUZuUwYCH7NnU9b_bP6sRlp&amp;index=20">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5GkCGkF11U&amp;list=PL_fl96m7OLQUZuUwYCH7NnU9b_bP6sRlp&amp;index=20</a><br /><br />WATCH ðŸŽ¥: 5 Causes Of Poor Blood Circulation - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1EO-kl0vn8&amp;list=PL_fl96m7OLQUZuUwYCH7NnU9b_bP6sRlp&amp;index=36">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1EO-kl0vn8&amp;list=PL_fl96m7OLQUZuUwYCH7NnU9b_bP6sRlp&amp;index=36</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Medical Disclaimer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i">https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />#HeartDisease #HeartHealth #Bestie<br /><br />Sources: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/0VfXF3Ef">https://pastebin.com/0VfXF3Ef</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />Intro - 0:00<br /><br />Music:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music">https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Summary:<br />1. Upset stomach: One heart-related symptom that is not as common as chest pain is an upset stomach which might manifest as a stomach ache, vomiting or acidity.<br /><br />2. Persistent Cough: A persistent cough doesnâ€™t always mean your heart has a problem, because itâ€™s a common symptom of many things like a cold, the flu, and bronchitis.<br /><br />3. Random cold sweats: Just because you sweat doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re going to have a heart attack. <br /><br />4. Anxiety: People who suffer with heart ailments may experience bouts of anxiety and heart palpitations.<br /><br />5. Leg Pain: General achiness or a cramping sensation in your legs can be a sign of peripheral artery disease or PAD. <br /><br />6. Swollen Ankles: Swollen ankles or feet can be a symptom of heart failure. Of course, many other conditions including pregnancy can cause swelling of the lower extremities, so donâ€™t panic. <br /><br />7. Unexplained Fatigue: Itâ€™s normal to feel tired after a day of hard work. Itâ€™s not normal to feel completely wiped out after getting dressed. <br /><br />9. You get dizzy or light-headed: Again, this is one of those symptoms that can have many non-heart related causes.<br /><br />10. Youâ€™re depressed: Depression is one of the most common problems in the world, and it affects 19 million Americans each year. <br /><br />11. Chest discomfort: Also known as angina, chest discomfort is one of the more obvious signs of an unhealthy heart.<br /><br />12. High cholesterol: Cholesterol is a fatty substance found in a number of foods, and is also made by your liver. <br /><br />13. Lack of stamina: We associate exercise with a healthy heart. But remember, a sedentary lifestyle is a risk factor for heart disease.<br /><br />For more information, please watch the video until the very end.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to Bestie : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/tUqro6">https://goo.gl/tUqro6</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/">https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bestiehealth/">https://www.instagram.com/bestiehealth/</a>{% endraw %}
