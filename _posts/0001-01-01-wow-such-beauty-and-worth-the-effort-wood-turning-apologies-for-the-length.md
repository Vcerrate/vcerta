{% raw %}Apologies for the length of this weeks video.  Apparently I had a lot to say.  This is a piece of Cherry Plum that I've had in the shop for a few years.  It's a difficult wood to turn due to it's hardness, bark inclusions and just overall nature in these pieces.  The result, however, is always worth the effort.  Beautiful grain and color, exceptional bark.  This is one of my new favorites!<br />Not A Commercial!  If you are in need of a Sand O Flex or any refills or accessories, this is the best place I have found for price and selection: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.supergrit.com/tblproduct_woodworking_sandoflex.html">https://www.supergrit.com/tblproduct_woodworking_sandoflex.html</a> <br />Please Like, Share and Subscribe if you are so inclined.<br />An Easy To View List Of My Videos:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/madronawoodworks/videos">https://www.youtube.com/user/madronawoodworks/videos</a> <br />Thank you to viewer and friend Tuffy Marginez for sending this along for all to enjoy!<br />Things I Like To Turn:<br />Live Edge Bowls, Natural Edge Bowls, Bark On Bowls, Firewood Pile Bowls, Natural Vases, Wood With Bug Holes, Cracked, Natural Voids, Knots, Ironwood.
