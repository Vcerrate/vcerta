{% raw %}The James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) has recently captured its most detailed image yet, less than three months after its launch in late December. NASA has confirmed that they have reached a new milestone in their efforts to set up the state-of-the-art telescope's optical system as it prepares for its first scientific observations in the summer. The new image shows a single, bright star against a backdrop of other, dimmer stars and galaxies in the far distance. This is the highest resolution infrared image ever taken from space. Webb is the next great space science observatory following Hubble, designed to answer outstanding questions about the Universe and to make breakthrough discoveries in all fields of astronomy. Webb will see farther into our origins: from the formation of stars and planets to the birth of the first galaxies in the early Universe.<br /><br />Remember to like and subscribe for much more to come!
