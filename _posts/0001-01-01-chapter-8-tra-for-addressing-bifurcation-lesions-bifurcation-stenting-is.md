{% raw %}Bifurcation stenting is a very important subset of coronary interventions. A sizable work has been done by the researchers across the globe including animal experiments, bench-testing and human studies. As a result, different techniques have evolved to address this area. Important techniques include provisional ʻTʼ stenting, crush technique, reverse crush technique, culottes technique and simultaneous kissing stent (SKS) technique. It is possible to use all these techniques<br />through TRA.{% endraw %}
