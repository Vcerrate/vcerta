{% raw %}This little kitten has been under 24 hour care and would have definitely not made it if she had not gotten to Dr Danielle Vought With Vought Veterinary Services and she notices the warble in her nostril. Here is the removal. We now hope this little one starts to thrive. We know she has to feel a whole lot better!<br /><br />For more of Paws across Pittsburgh, and more of their awesome work helping poor animals, check them out here:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pawsacrosspittsburgh">https://www.facebook.com/pawsacrosspittsburgh</a><br /><br />Note: All Videos Here On This Channel Have Been Allowed To Be Uploaded On It(except Commentary, it's Original And Added By Me With My Own Voice)<br /><br />Love Animals?
