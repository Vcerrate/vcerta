{% raw %}Opendoor is Beating Competition...and it Isn’t Even Close<br /><br />In this video I talk through Redfin's most recent earnings call and what it means for Opendoor / the iBuying space. I also review the financials of Opendoor, Offerpad, and Redfin over the past 8 quarters.<br /><br />Nothing in this video is financial advice. Do your own research and make your own financial decisions, independent of the opinions I express in this video.<br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MikeKelleyCo">https://twitter.com/MikeKelleyCo</a><br /><br />My Gear:<br />Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VyKXlt">https://amzn.to/2VyKXlt</a><br />Lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2T9ZphT">https://amzn.to/2T9ZphT</a><br />Microphone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2PQxh1B">https://amzn.to/2PQxh1B</a><br />Lights: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2TlYmKQ">https://amzn.to/2TlYmKQ</a><br /><br />#openstock #opendoorstock #opendoor #redfin #mikekelleyco{% endraw %}
