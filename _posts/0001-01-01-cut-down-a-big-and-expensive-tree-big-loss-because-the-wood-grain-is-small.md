{% raw %}Cut down a big and expensive tree!! Big loss because the wood grain is small.<br />The process of felling and cutting Trembesi trees is expensive and big, but the wood grain is small using the Husqvarna 3120 XP chainsaw, the best wood cutting machine in its class by a professional wood sensor operator.<br />This trembesi wood will be sent to Jepara as a material for wood crafts and furniture such as carved statues of solid trembesi chairs and tables.<br />#chainsaw<br />#husqvarna3120xp<br />#cutting_big_trees<br />@Is_Woko{% endraw %}
