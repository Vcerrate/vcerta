Arbitrarily I decided to finish one of these tracks, which I called Gravity (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/5dQTJQAx2FA).">https://youtu.be/5dQTJQAx2FA).</a> The other track was sort of forgotten over time. However in a random spout of inspiration I decided to go back and finish this song, which I consider to be the neglected twin brother of my track 'Gravity'.{% endraw %}
