{% raw %}(Quick reminder to press subscribe to my channel!) <br />Increase day was hard. <br />I am finding it all challenging at the moment, and I am feeling incredibly fortunate to have my parents to keep holding my hand and giving me all the hugs. <br />A bit of an update. <br />Thankyou for the continued support. It is appreciated more than I can fully explain. <br /><br />I hope one day I look back on these and see how far Iâ€™ve come. <br /><br />â€˜Perhaps the butterfly is proof that you can go through a great deal of darkness, yet still become something beautifulâ€™ <br /><br />One hour at a time. We will get there. <br /><br />#anorexiarecovery #recoveryispossible #eatingdisorderrecovery #edrecovery #inpatient #recovery #dayinthelife{% endraw %}
