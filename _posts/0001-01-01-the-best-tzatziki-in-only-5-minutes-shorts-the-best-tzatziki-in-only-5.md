{% raw %}The Best TZATZIKI in only 5 minutes! #shorts<br /><br />This is Easiest Most Delicious Tzatziki. Easiest version of all and a staple in my house. Tzatziki, also known as tarator or cacƒ±k, is a dip, soup, or sauce found in the cuisines of Southeast Europe and the Middle East. It is made of strained yogurt or diluted yogurt mixed with cucumbers, garlic, salt, olive oil, sometimes with vinegar or lemon juice, and herbs such as dill, mint, parsley and thyme depending on the preference. It takes 5 minutes from start to finish and the most refreshing dip or side to any dish. When we lived in Greece we ate tzatziki for every single meal and it‚Äôs one dip I will never get sick of. In Bulgaria we have our own yogurt dips, salads, and cold cucumber soup known as Tarator so our cuisine is very similar and I feel like most countries around the Balkans, Mediterranean, Middle East etc. have their take on yogurt dips and salads that are similar so it makes me incredibly happy to see similar versions shared around the world. Food is love and food is what unites us all.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />2 cups plain yogurt ‚Äî Greek Balkan-Style or any you like<br />1 grated English cucumber ‚Äî or any you have on hand<br />1-2 clioves of grated or minced garlic ‚Äî to taste<br />juice of 1/2 a lemon<br />salt to taste<br />tablespoon of olive oil<br />I measure dill with my heart ‚Äî about 1/4 cup fresh finely chopped dill<br />olives for garnish<br /><br />‚ú®You can find the full printable recipe with tips and directions here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.themodernnonna.com/easiest-most-delicious-tzatziki/">https://www.themodernnonna.com/easiest-most-delicious-tzatziki/</a><br /><br />Or you can search for ‚Äútzatziki‚Äù in the search tab on my blog and it will pop right up üåêwww.themodernnonna.com<br /><br />#tzatzikisauce #tzatzikisaucerecipe #tzatziki #tzatzikirecipe #viral #shorts #themodernnonna #easyrecipes{% endraw %}
