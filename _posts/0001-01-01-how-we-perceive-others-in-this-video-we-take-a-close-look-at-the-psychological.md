{% raw %}In this video, we take a close look at the psychological process of &quot;attribution,&quot; how we interpret the causes behind the behaviors of others. We will look at the difference between &quot;internal&quot; and &quot;external&quot; attributions, some factors influencing our attributions, and some common perceptual errors{% endraw %}
