{% raw %}There are only two ways to go while dealing with any situation - outward and inward. And the best way is indicated by our dear Sri Sathya Sai's name - SAI (See Always Inside). Our life's journey begins ONLY when we start going inwards. That was the message Swami gave our class during the Independence Day drama programme on 15th August 2004. That was the message Swami gave Prof. Kasturi and other devotees way back in 1948. That is the way to do true Seva (Service) too as Swami explained in multiple discourses.  It is only by going within will we be happy because we will be free of external dependencies. <br /><br />On many occasions Swami made it clear that the goal of the Sri Sathya Sai Avatar or the Sri Sathya Sai Organization is to take each individual within, towards the Truth. Going within is the only way we can keep Swami's legacy alive too...{% endraw %}
