This pattern was designed by Jean-sophie Wood, creator of the Block Lotto blog. <br /><br />During the early 2000s,  Jean-sophie designed quilt block patterns for her blog. Every month, quilters mailed in their finished blocks, and one lucky entrant won the lot! The Block Lotto is now a distant memory, but Jean-sophie’s patterns are still available, including this delightful Bird Block. <br /><br />Feather your nest with these sweet patchwork birds; they’re great scrap busters and such a joy to make! <br /><br />Get the supplies needed to make this quilt by clicking the link below:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.missouriquiltco.com/blogs/fridays-with-jenny/block-lotto-bird-block?utm_campaign=qt_t446&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_content=msqc&amp;utm_term=qt_t446">https://www.missouriquiltco.com/blogs/fridays-with-jenny/block-lotto-bird-block?utm_campaign=qt_t446&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_content=msqc&amp;utm_term=qt_t446</a><br /><br />Learn to sew with Jenny Doan as she teaches quilting tutorials from the heart.
