{% raw %}Meghan &amp; Harry seem to think they are in imminent danger from the press, &amp; that &quot;history is repeating itself,&quot; in regards to paparazzi chasing them down. I wanted to find out if there was evidence of this. I go back &amp; compare the relationships of the royals &amp; the press- Diana, Kate, &amp; Meghan. Who really had it worse, &amp; is history really repeating itself? <br /><br />*Donations to the channel are welcome at: www.buymeacoffee.com/pilothardy<br /><br />**Don't forget to comment below and/or donate for a chance to get a special shout out in my next video!! :)<br /><br />***LOTS OF LOVE to all my subscribers &amp; new viewers!! <br />ðŸ’ž -Pilot{% endraw %}
