{% raw %}Historically, the concept of stuck-at fault did not originate from physical observations but rather to model faults at the gate level. Standard stuck-at fault models may not apply well on analog circuits because even a slight variation inside those circuits could create deviations of different magnitudes. That means that standard stuck-at faults would not be general enough for analog behavior. Recent work has proposed a technique for modeling oxide defects, less abstract concerning the digital stuck-at fault.<br /><br />This paper focuses on evaluating faults proposed by the IEEE P2427 standard, which is still a work-in-progress standard. Moreover, a novel approach for modeling realistic stuck-at faults based on oxide defects is presented. We investigate the impact of these faults on the circuit on two designs taken from the IEEE analog-benchmarks circuit collection: an operational amplifier and a comparator model. We apply a novel method relying on AC matrices extracted at several operating points and combine it with a circle-fitting technique in order to extend the comparison to faults with uncertain parameters.<br /><br />Authors: SADIA AZAM1, Nicola Dall'Ora2, Enrico Fraccaroli3, André Alberts4, Renaud Gillon5, Franco Fummi6<br />1University of Verona ,italy, 2University of Verona, 3Università degli Studi di Verona, 4Sydelity B.V., Kruisem, Belgium, 5Sydelity B.V., Kruisem, Belgium, 6Universita' di Verona{% endraw %}
