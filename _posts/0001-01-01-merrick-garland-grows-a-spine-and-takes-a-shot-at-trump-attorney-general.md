{% raw %}Attorney General Merrick Garland has finally spoken up, and spoken out, about the potential for prosecuting Donald Trump and others with information from the January 6th Committee. Garland said that the DOJ will NOT shy away from prosecutions, and that they won't be afraid to go after &quot;political cases.&quot; This comes after Republicans tried to threaten him into submission earlier this week. Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins explains what's happening. <br /><br />Link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rawstory.com/merrick-garland-2656908487/">https://www.rawstory.com/merrick-garland-2656908487/</a><br /><br />Become a member today!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join</a><br /><br />Support us by becoming a monthly patron on Patreon, and help keep progressive media alive!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire">https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire</a><br /><br />Find our merchandise at Teespring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store">https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store</a><br /><br />Spread the word!

We've all seen the movies. We've read the book and we understand at the end, the Grinch's heart grew three sizes and he suddenly starts caring and he starts doing good things. Right? Well, a similar thing apparently happened this week with attorney general Merrick Garland, except it wasn't his heart that grew three sizes, apparently it was his backbone because Merrick Garland came out this week and made it crystal clear that his Department of Justice is not going to shy away from political prosecutions if, of course, they get recommendations to prosecute certain individuals. Here's part of Garland's statement this week. We are not avoiding cases that are political or cases that are controversial or sensitive. What we are avoiding is making decisions on a political basis on a partisan basis. This is what he told NPR. Every FBI office, almost every US attorney's office in the country's working on this matter.<br /><br />We've issued thousands of subpoenas, seized and examined records of electronic, examined thousands of electronic devices. Examined terabytes of data, thousands of hours of videos. People are working every day, 24 7 and are fully aware of how important this is. This had to do with the interference with the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to another and it doesn't get more important than that. We begin with the cases that are right in front of us with the overt actions and then we build from there. And that is a process that we will continue to build until we hold everyone accountable who committed criminal acts with respect to January 6th. I hope this is genuine. I hope Merrick Garland means what he said to NPR this week. I hope that he said this in order to shut people like me up that have called him out for not doing anything. There is nothing I would love more in the world right now than to be wrong about Merrick Garland and the DOJ not doing anything about the alleged criminal acts from people like Donald Trump. I hope I'm wrong.<br /><br />I want to be wrong about that. And this statement gives me hope, not much. Don't get me wrong. We see politicians come out all the time and say things that we know, yeah, that's not true, or that's not actually happening. But the way he went into detail about it, right? We got the documents. We got the electronic devices. We've been through terabytes of data. We are doing this, so maybe you guys just need to shut the hell up for a little bit. I kind of like that. I like the tough talk from the attorney general. I like him firing back at both Donald Trump and the Republican party, because that's clearly what this was. As we discussed earlier in the week, the Republicans have come out and they're trying to threaten the DOJ like, oh, you don't wanna, you don't wanna investigate Trump, because if you do, everybody's gonna think you're partisan and it's gonna backfire on you. And Garland came out and in much more polite words said, to hell with that. We're not afraid. We're gonna do what we have to do. And again, I gotta tell you, that's the kind of talk I've been waiting to hear from this attorney general. It's about time.{% endraw %}
