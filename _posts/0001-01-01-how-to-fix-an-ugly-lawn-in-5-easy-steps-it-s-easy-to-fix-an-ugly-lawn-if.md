{% raw %}It's easy to fix an ugly lawn if you learn the proper techniques. There are 5 steps to reviving a lawn. The more steps you complete, the better your lawn will be!<br /><br />All the videos mentioned in this video are on this easy playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXlWmhRBoMXjuVsWPQ4EwRXpvzVhh9IaQ">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXlWmhRBoMXjuVsWPQ4EwRXpvzVhh9IaQ</a><br /><br />Step 1: Proper Mowing - Ensure your blades are sharp, and that you are mulch mowing at the highest height possible with your mower.<br /><br />Step 2: Proper Watering - You should be watering 1in of water per week. But to know if you're watering enough, do the tuna can test. If you are, and you still see dry spots, use a soil conditioner to allow the water to penetrate the soil.<br /><br />Step 3: Proper Fertilizing - Want the easy method? Apply milorganite 4 times per year. Boom. Done. No really, you can apply it any time that fits your schedule. Some people like to do it a week or two before every holiday, birthday party, etc, so when family and friends are over the lawn is looking sharp!<br /><br />Step 4: Killing and Preventing Weeds - This is where most people get it wrong! And it's so easy. The simple method would be to apply Step 1 (crabgrass preventer) when the forsythia blooms (or as soon after as you can). Then use the &quot;ready to spray&quot; weed sprays starting with the one that kills crabgrass, and then moving on to the harder weeds. Just leave a few weeks in between to allow your grass to not get stressed. Easy!<br /><br />Step 5: Overseed in the fall. After completing Step 4 you're likely to have areas in the lawn with no grass. It happens! But lucky for you seeding in the fall is very easy to do. Some people will just throw the seed down and water it. I prefer applying a layer of peat moss on top. Aerator? Fall is the perfect time to aerate and overseed!<br /><br />That's all there is to it. You can do this! By this time next year you'll be watching the rest of my videos to take your good lawn to perfection. (Sorry, it's an addiction. The better your lawn looks, the more you'll want to see how far you can go with it!)<br /><br />Want to watch more lawn care videos with lawn care tips like these?
