{% raw %}Law and Border is not a show I expect to be able to survive long due to the content and even the name.<br /><br />Ben Bergquam is a name many people saw due to a DailyBeast article about him posting pictures of himself hospitalized from covid along with supplements and MyPillow ads. Followed up by trying to sell shirts and going to the Trump rally while still on oxygen.<br /><br />Gary Chodorow owner of LawAndBorder.com and writer of the Law and Border Blog might have something to say about it.{% endraw %}
