{% raw %}7 Times Amber Heard Lied Under Oath &amp; Got Caught<br />While it may seem basic to hear at first, the case that is going on with Amber Heard and Johnny Depp (in this particular instance the Defamation case that has been going on for over two weeks now) is very much one of truth and lies. To be more specific, Johnny Depp is trying to prove once and for all that Amber Heard has lied to the world at large about the accusations of abuse that she's had tied to him. As of right now, there is no verdict that can be rendered for various reasons. That being said, what has been said both during this trial AND previous ones (the UK Libel case) proves she has lied to lawyers and others. We'll break it down for you, be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel!<br />#JohnnyDepp #AmberHeard #Trial{% endraw %}
