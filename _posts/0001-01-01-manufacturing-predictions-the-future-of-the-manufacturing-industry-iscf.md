{% raw %}What will the future of manufacturing be like?<br /><br />Imagine needing a new part for a household appliance. You could order it, get it made locally and get it delivered to your door within a couple of hours.<br /><br />Advances in 3D Printing and additive manufacturing will reduce waste even more, making it possible to create products and components that we can't make now.<br /><br />Everything will be connected by the Internet of Things to ensure that supply can keep track of changes in demand.<br /><br />Robots will take care of the repetitive, dangerous processes so that people can focus on matters where human interaction is so valuable. <br /><br />So whether you are a manufacturer or a consumer, we are going to see much more manufacturing as part of our everyday lives.<br /><br />Anything, anywhere<br /><br />In the next 30 years, we will see manufacturing become more and more unbound from the idea of factories as we know them today. It will be freed up to appear in new locations, becoming an empowering force that drives customisation and personalisation of products across multiple sectors. All of this thanks to 3D printing innovation.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2035: Do you see a piece of jewellery you like in a shop window, but itâ€™s not quite the right colour or size? The shop will be able to 3D print you a custom piece in minutes, based precisely on your measurements and preferences. 3D Printing will drive a true paradigm shift for manufacturing, away from the mass production in a distant factory to something that happens right in front of you, creating a bespoke product for the same cost. By 2050 you may even be able to print clothes at home from designs shared online.<br /><br />Subscribe to our YouTube channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Innovateuk?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/Innovateuk?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Find out about our other predictions, including healthcare and cities, here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrMOhOrmeR6n2k12dXD5aIL7dxYfD-wTL">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrMOhOrmeR6n2k12dXD5aIL7dxYfD-wTL</a><br /><br />Click here to find out our essential tips for small businesses: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrMOhOrmeR6nlRxAZQTqPXraZ7e7ZavFc">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrMOhOrmeR6nlRxAZQTqPXraZ7e7ZavFc</a>{% endraw %}
