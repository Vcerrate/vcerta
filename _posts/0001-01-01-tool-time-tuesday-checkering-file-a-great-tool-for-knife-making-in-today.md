But the original idea behind what we wanted it to be is this description below:<br /><br />Videos on our journey to homesteading. With a recent purchase of a little piece of the Alberta prairie, we're looking to sell our nice suburban home in search of a more meaningful life beyond chasing the &quot;American dream&quot; working for some big company and making someone else rich. It's not about the money, it's about getting the most value from the work I do to improving the life of my family.<br /><br />Some preparedness, DIY, building quality things with your hands, guns, gear, and outdoor exploration.<br /><br />Mailing Address:<br />Box 6, Site 16 RR2<br />Strathmore, Alberta<br />Canada<br />T1P 1K5{% endraw %}
