{% raw %}The first leg of the attack that Russia planned to launch in the Donbas region started today. Russia bombarded almost every part of the country in the morning hours. It did not go unnoticed that these bombardments were similar to the invasion that started on February 24th. Russian Army, Ukrainian air defense systems targeted military unit positions. However, it is reported that the Ukrainian Armed Forces is prepared for these attacks is thought that the Ukrainian armed forces emerged with the least damage from the expected attacks. Russia, on the other hand, started to withdraw its troops from many regions with the operations it started in the east. Helicopters in the Carson region have been withdrawn, as can be seen from satellite images. The sudden disappearance of helicopters in corner Baika reveals 2 situations. The first situation is that Carson, which was more vulnerable during the period when Russia concentrated to the east, fears that it will be occupied again by the Ukrainian armed forces. If this happens, Russia is afraid of losing its helicopters as well as losing many of its battleships to Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion. The second situation may be that the troops withdrawn from Carson will be used in the attack launched by Russia and Dondas. These helicopters can support the Russian army by participating in attacks in the region. However, it is seen that Ukraine very openly threatens the helicopters with the ammunition it receives from the USA and NATO. Systems that can shoot down Russian warplanes will not allow Russian helicopters in the region. There are reports that Russian battleships have already been destroyed in Kharkov and Izium, and most of this news is supported by images. For this reason, the use of these helicopters in Russia's moves in the east can only be realized within safe zones, but no one is sure if there is a safe zone for the Russian army in Ukraine.
