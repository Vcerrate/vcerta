{% raw %}AYO TONY PASSA ME DA MACHINE GUN!<br />Seriously though Easy Red 2 is a lot of fun. It scratches the same itch Enlisted did - simple WW2 run around shoot man game - but it does it with a lot more cool features, actual battle variety and no awful monetisation. By the way, the dev literally updated the game because we asked him to to fix an issue we ran into with Multiplayer, and they also updated the game recently to improve the plane bouncing around problem. Very cool dev, fun game. Give it a try!<br /><br />This video was edited by Sai who works with Vimerse (vimerse.com).
