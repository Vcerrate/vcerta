What about trust?<br />What about us?<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />We are problems that want to be solved<br />We are children that need to be loved<br />We were willing, we came when you called<br />But then you fooled us, enough is enough<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />What about us?<br />What about all the times you said you had the answers?<br />What about us?<br />What about all the broken happy ever afters?<br />What about us?<br />What about all the plans that ended in disasters?<br />What about love? What about trust?<br />What about us?<br /><br />What about us?<br />What about all the plans that ended in disasters?<br />What about love? What about trust?<br />What about us?<br /><br />[Bridge]<br />Sticks and stones they may break these bones<br />But then I'll be ready, are you ready?<br />It's the start of us, waking up come on<br />Are you ready? I'll be ready<br />I don't want control, I want to let go<br />Are you ready? I'll be ready<br />And now it's time to let them know<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />What about us?<br />What about all the times you said you had the answers?<br />What about us?<br />What about all the broken happy ever afters?<br />What about us?<br />What about all the plans that ended in disasters?<br />What about love?
