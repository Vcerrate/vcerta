{% raw %}It's Challenge time!  HobbyFamily must stock a shelf in the store before the Monster customer takes there items away!  The first to complete the challenge WINS a BITCOIN.  Then we play Night of the Consumer, where we have to stock the shelves in the store before the crazy consumers tattle on us to the manager.
