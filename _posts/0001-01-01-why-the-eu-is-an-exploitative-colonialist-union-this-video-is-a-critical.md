In the past we talked about how the governments of China, the USSR and the USA work and worked. Now we are applying the same thing to the European union. The … entity that unites Europe in shared goals and enabled many positive social and trade relations between European nations which made a war in central Europe all but impossible, which I think is good.<br />But despite that many people are sceptical of the EU, most notably the British. The EU guarantees three main freedoms Freedom of Movement, meaning you can travel from country to country without any visa checks or passport controls. <br />The freedom of goods meaning no tariffs between European nations and the freedom of capital which means you can transfer money around Europe without any fees. As you can tell two of these 3 freedoms are purely neoliberal economic policies and only one is good for the average person, and that will be a theme in this video. To help with the freedom of capital the EU also provided a unified currency aka the Euro.<br />Naturally the EU is controversial for example it’s accused of things like economically and socially exploiting poor countries, not caring for the people, being overly bureaucratic and out of control, and generally making decisions over people’s heads. <br />You have probably heard a lot of the EU. It’s among the most important international entities along with the USA and China. But despite that many people around the world barely know anything about how it works. We hear about the EU negotiating trade and regulating products, and of course the UK leaving the EU but beyond that most people, and I am including Europeans, don’t know how it works. <br />This is because the EU is hideously complicated since it tries to balance the wishes of all 27 member states so the structure is very hard to wrap your head around. Which must be on purpose because it was also the EU that formed one organ called the European council and one called the council of the European union, which is not to be confused with the council of Europe. <br />We will go over the governing bodies one by one, talk about how the EU makes laws and how laws are enforced and interpreted. I’ll tell you what I think is bad about the EU, and the parts I consider alright. I believe the structure of the EU can be better understood if you compare it to the structure of a regular state, that makes all the irregularities a lot easier to understand.<br />So, for this video I will first explain how the American government works, in hopes that it makes the EU easier to be understood. Of course, there is a video on the US government already if you are interested but since this one is not about the US I will simplify a lot.{% endraw %}
