{% raw %}Reasonably Priced Villa<br /><br />Very reasonably priced 2 bedroom two bathroom villa located within one of the most established gated communities here on the north coast of The Dominican Republic. As this property was constructed in one of the earlier phases of the development, you’ll find that it was definitely built to last, plus it’s set on a nice oversize lot of 779 sqm . There is a good amount of space either side of the villa which means this property is very private and not overlooked.<br /><br />The size of the lot offers more than enough space for expansion should it be required, or to grow and produce your own fruits and vegetables, there are plenty of options here. Also ideal for pet owners if you’re looking for a decent size yard for your four legged friend.<br /><br />The main house has a combined kitchen, dining and living area which extends out to a comfortable covered patio area overlooking the pool. There are two bedrooms, one with en suite bathroom that has doors which open up to the patio area. The second bedroom with garden views shares a bathroom with the main living area.<br /><br />Reasonably Priced Villa<br /><br />Being an older property, some renovation is required, however, any potential buyer with a creative mind will find that with some subtle changes, this property can be enhanced and updated very nicely without breaking the bank.<br /><br />Location: The beach resort town of Sosua lies less than 10 minutes’ drive to the west with Cabarete Beach town just 20 minutes’ drive east so you really are spoiled for choice. Puerto Plata International Airport is located just 20 minutes’ drive to the east.<br /><br />Price: U$210,000<br /><br />For more information about this Reasonably Priced Villa, don’t hesitate to visit us at Drpropertyguys.com or you can always reach out to us by phone at your convenience:<br /><br />Tay: 809 756 7611<br />Phil: 809 707 3598<br /><br />If you’re in the area, please let us know, it would be our pleasure to show you around and share with you our combined 50 years of living here in The Dominican Republic.
