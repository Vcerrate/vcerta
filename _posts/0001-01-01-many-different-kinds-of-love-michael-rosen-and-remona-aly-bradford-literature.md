{% raw %}Bradford Literature Festival Digital Education Programme 2021<br />www.bradfordlitfest.co.uk<br /><br />Recommended for age 8+<br /><br />In March 2020, acclaimed British children’s author and poet Michael Rosen fell ill with COVID-19. The celebrated Children’s Laureate spent months on a medical ward and was placed into an induced coma before enduring weeks of recovery as the NHS worked tirelessly to save his life.<br /><br />While Rosen convalesced, his nurses kept a diary by his bed, writing him regular letters of hope and support. Fortunately his condition improved and, as soon as he was able, he started writing his own story featuring new works of prose, the daily coronavirus diaries provided by NHS staff, and glorious new images from illustrator Chris Riddell.<br /><br />A tribute to the power of community, the unshakable spirit of caregivers and the critical importance of our health service, Rosen joins us to recall a story of love and life that we’ll all be able to relate to after an incredibly difficult year.<br /><br />#BradfordLitFest{% endraw %}
