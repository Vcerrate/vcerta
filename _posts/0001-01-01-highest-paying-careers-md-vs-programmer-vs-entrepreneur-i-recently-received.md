{% raw %}I recently received a message from a viewer pointing out that I always say medicine isn't a good career if you're optimizing for money, but I never discuss what those other career options are. Well, let's change that.<br /><br />In this video, we'll cover the careers with the highest salaries including medicine, computer science, engineering, law, finance, and entrepreneurship. In addition to looking at salary, we will also consider other factors such as income potential, probability, opportunity cost, and lifestyle to help you determine if it might be a good fit for you. <br /><br />If money is your number one priority in a career, this video is for you. <br /><br />üíØ Join this channel for exclusive perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8KZzzSLN6r0jbPJvWC5f9g/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8KZzzSLN6r0jbPJvWC5f9g/join</a><br />üåç Website &amp; blog - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kevinjubbal.com">https://kevinjubbal.com</a><br />üíå Weekly newsletter - Coming Soon<br /><br />üì∏ Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/kevinjubbalmd">https://instagram.com/kevinjubbalmd</a><br />üê¶ Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/kevinjubbalmd">https://twitter.com/kevinjubbalmd</a><br />üó£Ô∏è Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/kevinjubbalmd">https://facebook.com/kevinjubbalmd</a><br />üéµ Tiktok - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kevinjubbalmd">https://www.tiktok.com/@kevinjubbalmd</a><br /><br />üé• My Youtube Gear: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kit.co/kevinjubbalmd/">https://kit.co/kevinjubbalmd/</a><br />üëÄ Hand Picked Productivity Tools: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/medschoolinsiders">https://www.amazon.com/shop/medschoolinsiders</a><br />üéµMy Study Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1231934998/playlist/5joGbr1aQAIbMcJ9bOvJlk?si=iOAxgKNTQt-rrp1L8g-YWQ">https://open.spotify.com/user/1231934998/playlist/5joGbr1aQAIbMcJ9bOvJlk?si=iOAxgKNTQt-rrp1L8g-YWQ</a><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />00:00 - Introduction<br />00:40 - What To Consider When Choosing a Career<br />01:59 - Physician<br />05:11 - Computer Science<br />07:00 - Engineering<br />08:47 - Lawyer<br />10:47 - Finance<br />12:21 - Entrepreneur<br /><br />LINKS FROM VIDEO:<br />Top 10 Highest Paid Doctor Specialties: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/gJkGZDYjNII">https://youtu.be/gJkGZDYjNII</a><br />So You Want to Be a Doctor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu5WzOL8-O8&amp;list=PL2ADAFpTg5aaDaa9GX90-DO0aBsGLY8jQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu5WzOL8-O8&amp;list=PL2ADAFpTg5aaDaa9GX90-DO0aBsGLY8jQ</a><br />Competitiveness of Med School vs Pharmacy vs Dental vs PA vs Business vs Law: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/liHdPYaMkaU">https://youtu.be/liHdPYaMkaU</a><br />Why I Quit Plastic Surgery Residency: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO-8tgx3UP8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO-8tgx3UP8</a><br /><br />#doctor #careers #money<br />====================<br /><br />Disclaimer: Content of this video is my opinion and does not constitute medical advice.
