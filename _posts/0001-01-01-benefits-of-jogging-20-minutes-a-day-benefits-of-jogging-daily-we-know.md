The average person burns between 80 to 140 calories per mile while jogging. This means that you‚Äôll be burning almost 160- 280 calories just by jogging for 20 minutes. <br /><br />Stress reduction<br /><br />Jogging 20 minutes a day can get your body to release those endorphins and it will raise your oxytocin and serotonin levels. Both these hormones are referred to as happy hormones and they can instantly enlighten your mood and battle with the feeling of sadness. <br /><br />Excellent for heart health<br /><br />To maintain a healthy heart, we must make consistent efforts to jog for 20 minutes each day. Studies have proven this fact that people who actively were involved in jogging for 20 minutes a day had a lesser chance to be diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases, Diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and many other diseases.
