{% raw %}Use these paragraph formulas to write your academic essay in 10-minutes or less. Don't stare at the page, trying to write sentences in your head. Instead, pull out these formulas and fill in the blanks. Let the formulas do the heavy lifting.<br /><br />I've been teaching students to do this for over 20 years.
