{% raw %}Something that I've noticed from video of others using Stormchaser. The small amount of delay before you can charge the next shot does not happen on the third burst of Stormchaser, but rather the first burst. In other words, you can start to charge the weapon immediately after the burst as opposed to having a small delay like other Linears.<br /><br />If you're wondering what my Stormchaser roll is: Fluted Barrael +Projection Fuse + Clown Cartridge + Firing Line{% endraw %}
