{% raw %}Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and long time truth teller Chris Hedges sits down with Briahna for an intimate conversation about the recent purging of his RT show On Contact from YouTube, what to make of online criticism AOC received for &quot;stealing valor&quot; from the successful Amazon unionization effort, the limits of electoralism, and why he still fights despite it all. Briahna asks Hedges to respond to Ro Khanna's apparent surprise that esteemed public intellectuals like Hedges and Cornel West are not invited onto mainstream news outlets, and he even responds to his first ever clip from The View. The two spar over the relevance of social media to progressive movements, and have a solemn conversation about the personal risks of fighting for what you believe in.{% endraw %}
