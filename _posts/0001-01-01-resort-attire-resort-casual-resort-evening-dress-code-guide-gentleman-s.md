It's even the basis for an annual collection of couture fashion designers who focus just on this segment because a lot of people want to look stylish even when they relax. You'll most likely find it in the country clubs or nice resorts or hotels that want to make sure that guests don't show up in board shorts for dinner. Sometimes the dress code resort wear can be ambiguous because different hotels or resorts define it differently. As a rule of thumb keep in mind the more posh or upscale an establishment is, the more formal the dress code is likely going to be.  <br /><br />So before I approach you with some ideas of what to wear when the dress code is resort casual, first let's discuss what not to wear. <br /><br />Athletic attire of any kind is always inappropriate. Your gym shorts, your t-shirts are not appropriate. That also means no track pants, no sweatpants, no joggers and no workout shorts. Avoid wearing t-shirts or tank tops and always make sure your shirts have some kind of a collar such as a polo shirt would be fine with short sleeves or long sleeves or a dress shirt. It also means don't wear shower slides, flip-flops or sandals unless you're specifically at the beach or by the pool area. You definitely want to avoid any type of tennis shoes or trainers. Definitely stay clear of black because that would be too formal. In some establishments, golf khakis or slacks with polo shirt are acceptable in a clubhouse. In others, they aren't so it pays to specifically ask or figure out what the proper dress code at your venue is.<br /><br />So what should you wear when it comes to resort casual during the day?<br />The first thing that probably comes to mind is the Hawaiian shirt. I've been to Hawaii recently and I hardly saw anybody wearing Hawaiian shirts. So they're out there, they exist. They can be appropriate if you're in the mood for it, go for it, but it's definitely not something you have to have and sometimes it can also look a bit cheesy. So in terms of slacks, you can go with linen pants or cotton pants. Things like seersucker is totally fine and you can also go with shorts as long as they are longer and made of cotton or linen or other interesting materials. At the same time skip any kind of swim trunks or board shorts because that would be too informal. Try to keep with a shirt unless you're at the pool or at the beach. A polo shirt is just fine during the day, a t-shirt maybe a little too informal but if you're at the beach or in the vicinity that's okay too. I say jackets are over-the-top and if you're at a resort during offseason you may want to have a thin sweater or something that keeps you at the ideal temperature.<br /><br />In terms of shoes you can wear driving mocs, maybe boat shoes. If you're at the beach and you go from your room to the pool flip-flops are just fine. <br /><br />So what does resort evening wear mean?<br />It means typical long sleeves, long pants, no more tailored shorts. It also means closed-toed shoes which can be your general derbies or oxfords in brown tones or tans. You can also be a little more playful maybe if you wanna go with a pair of spectators or maybe some white shoes. Something that is more summery and more associated with tropics. Stay clear of black shoes even in the evening because it's not quite suited to the tropics. A jacket is not mandatory but definitely a good idea. Personally, I always like it because in the evening and can get a little cooler and it's also much more elegant and stylish. A navy blazer is very versatile and you can wear it even though I think a cotton jacket such as the one I'm wearing here right now with a slight check, maybe a fresco jacket in a lighter color is preferable. If you want to you can wear a seersucker suit but in general, I'd stay clear of suits and rather go with combinations.<br /><br />#resortattire #dresscode #resortcasual<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Want to stay updated?
