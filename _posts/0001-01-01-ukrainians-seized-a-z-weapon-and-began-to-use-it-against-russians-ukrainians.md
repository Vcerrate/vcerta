{% raw %}Ukrainians seized a ‘Z’ weapon and began to use it against Russians.<br />Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the war launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin against the Ukrainians, hundreds of photos of captured Russian weapons have been published daily on social media. A tweet from the UKRAINE-RUSSIA archives reports that the first use of seized Russian weapons against their former owners has already been documented.<br />This is a captured heavy flamethrower launcher with thermobaric warheads TOS-1A Solntsepyok also known as Object 634 or TOS-1 Buratino. The photo captured a moment when the system fired a rocket. The Twitter account claims that this happened in the Izyum direction, Kharkiv, Ukraine, and the information was confirmed by Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesman for the Odesa OVA. The capital letter “Z” written on the TOS-1 launching block is clearly visible. A local source at BulgarianMilitary.com confirmed that the Ukrainians have repaired the system.<br />Since the beginning of the war, the Ukrainians have successfully managed to repair and restore captured Russian weapons, which allows them to be reused. These are tanks, armored vehicles, trucks, and other vehicles abandoned by their crews, sometimes in perfect condition, stuck in a forest or field. Some of these weapons have been adopted into the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.{% endraw %}
