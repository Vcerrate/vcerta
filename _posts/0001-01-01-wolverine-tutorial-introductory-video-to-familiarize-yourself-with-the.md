Thank you all for your support!<br /><br />Robert aka &quot;BloodTide&quot; who helped with the arcade controller overlay setup and finetuned the sound for this stream. BloodTide has always been my right-hand man and technical expert in resolving issues that Fighters Evolution has faced, without him we wouldn't be where we are today.<br /><br />Chris aka &quot;CSVagrant&quot; who helped teach me many of the things I know in these games and who has graciously provided content to Fighters Evolution over the years. CSVagrant has the most creative combo content, we owe a great gratitude to him for the contributions he has made.<br /><br />Ryan aka &quot;The Utility Man&quot; for always keeping my head screwed on straight and being a great supportive friend. The Utility Man has helped BETA Test and review many of the content that Fighters Evolution has released and continues to release. <br /><br />Luther aka &quot;Doobie Scholar&quot; for the support when I needed it the most. I wouldn't be doing this stream if not for Doobie's words of encouragement and his support BETA testing and reviewing the content Fighters Evolution has released and continues to release.<br /><br />Robert aka &quot;Rob2D&quot; for providing solutions to technical issues and always being a great friend. Without Rob2D Fighters Evolution would have never been able to provide LIVE HD Streaming from the Arcade1up cabinet.<br />------------------------------------------<br />Legal Disclaimer: <br />------------------------------------------<br />All music and video used are the property of their respective owners. &quot;Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
