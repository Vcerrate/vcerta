Traditional advocates of medicine, by contrast, believe nutrition takes a back seat to medicine, which is all-powerful.<br /> <br />A growing body of data says both sides are wrong and that food and medicine can work together harmoniously, each enhancing the value of the other.<br /><br />Today on The Dhru Purohit Podcast, Dhru talks with Dr. William Li about how food has the ability to combat and prevent things like cancer, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and illness. They also discuss how certain foods can positively impact the effectiveness of medicine.<br /><br />Dr. Li is a world-renowned physician, scientist, speaker, and author of Eat to Beat Disease—The New Science of How Your Body Can Heal Itself.
