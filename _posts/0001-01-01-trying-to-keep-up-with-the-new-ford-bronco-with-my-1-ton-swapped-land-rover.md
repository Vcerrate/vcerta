{% raw %}For a bone stock 4x4 the New Ford Bronco is hard to beat!<br />Sure, I pulled it out a couple times but my 1 ton swapped Land Rover took over a year to build and this Bronco is BONE STOCK! There was no where my Land Rover Discovery could go that this Bronco could not. In fact, I would argue the new Ford Bronco on stock 35s is better than my Land Rover on 37s... It makes me want my own Bronco!<br />Any way, I've been on a break for the last 3 weeks and I couldn't be more excited to be back! I deleted all social media off of my phone and spent extra time with family. Now that I have recharged batteries, I'm ready to make fresh travel content! This first video back is a special one. We are heading to North America and exploring a tiny segment of the giant amount of public land that Canada has to offer. Shaun @The Story Till Now was a great host. Him and Teddy @Unwinding Roads led us on an incredible journey with some of my Patreon supporters. I hope you enjoy the adventure as much as we did!<br /><br />Where in the world should we travel next?<br />Do you live in a foreign country and want to take me offroad? Send me an email and lets work it out!<br />Thank you Techron for sponsoring today's video.
