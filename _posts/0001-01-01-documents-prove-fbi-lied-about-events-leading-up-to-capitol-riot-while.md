{% raw %}While it likely could not have prevented all of the violence seen on January 6th during the Capitol Riot, new documents obtained by Rolling Stone prove that the FBI was actively monitoring the social media accounts of the soon-to-be rioters and could have done more to prevent the attack. At this point, the attack itself, to a certain degree, needs to be viewed as a massive failure of our police and intelligence agencies who had all of the warning signs that something bad was going to happen that day, but failed to act. Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins discusses this. <br /><br />Link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/jan6-fbi-social-media-privacy-black-lives-matter-1337565/">https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/jan6-fbi-social-media-privacy-black-lives-matter-1337565/</a> <br /><br />Become a member today!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join</a><br /><br />Support us by becoming a monthly patron on Patreon, and help keep progressive media alive!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire">https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire</a><br /><br />Find our merchandise at Teespring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store">https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store</a><br /><br />Spread the word!

So let's not forget last summer, FBI director, Christopher Ray gets hauled in front of Congress and says, Hey, listen, here's his direct quote. Um, said, we're, we're, we're limited in what we can pull from social media. <br /><br />So we, we don't know. I mean, you know, there's not any failures on our part on the FBI's part before January 6th, we could only kind of do some things on social media. We really couldn't, you know, do everything. We couldn't uncover it all. That's why we couldn't prevent it. Well, this is from rolling stone. The new document, the agency has all the authority. It needs to monitor the social media platforms in the name of public safety. And in fact, the bureau had done just that during the nationwide wide wave of racial justice protests in 2020 critics of the FBI say that the Bureau's desire for more authority and surveillance tools as part of a decade long expansion of the vast security apparatus inside the federal government. So the FBI went to Congress last summer and said, Hey, we kind of looked at social media, not a whole lot. <br /><br />We can do with just that. We need more tools by the way. So we can prevent the next January 6th. But as this report points out, their internal documents show, they had no problem going through social media posts, finding out people's personal information with the tools that they have readily available during the George Floyd protests in the summer of 2020. So when it's black lives matter folks, oh yeah. We're able to get them, find them, locate them, pinpoint their location with obscene accuracy. But, uh, you know, all these people issuing death threats on gab and parlor and all those other right wing sites. Like there's nothing we could have done about that. But here's the kicker folks. We knew this, we here at RGO fire were even doing reports because other people had gone out there and done the investigations. You know, we were reporting on what they found. They found all the threats, okay. Investigative reporters were able to do this. They were able to identify the people and show that, Hey, something bad is gonna happen on January 6th. If we knew it, they knew it. <br /><br />Go back and look through the archives folks. The videos we were doing prior to January 6th, talking about all these threats that they were issuing against Congress. Everybody knew it was gonna happen. And also, we also know that the FBI is total totally full of crap here about, oh, we couldn't do anything. Cuz they actually did make some arrests. When people arrived in DC, like when they got off their planes, the FBI was waiting for 'em. So the FBIs lying and they're lying because they want more power to spy on us, but they already have more than enough power to spy on us. They have more than enough power to stop the next January 6th. But they look at this tragedy as an opportunity to expand the surveillance state here in the United States.{% endraw %}
