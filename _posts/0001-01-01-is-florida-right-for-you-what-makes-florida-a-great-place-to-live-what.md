{% raw %}What is it that draws you to Florida?  Is it the weather?  Is it the theme parks?  Maybe it's laid back lifestyle of a small beach town.  The fact is, if you feel drawn to a place, there is probably a reason for it.  We moved to Florida in February of 2019 because we craved to live where we vacationed.  For us, live is an adventure - and Florida offers us an endless selection of them.  What draws you to Florida?  Leave it in the comments below.
