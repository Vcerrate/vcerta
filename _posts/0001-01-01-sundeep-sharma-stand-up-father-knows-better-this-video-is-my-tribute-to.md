{% raw %}This video is my tribute to my late father Shri Hariom Sharma, an honest and upright farmer who sold tea outside his school to pay for his school fee and went on to pursue post graduation and got himself a law degree. Later he worked in the city of Bareilly and pursued transport and molasses business. Not every tea seller becomes the PM but for me he was and will always be the example of everything that was and is good in this world. I am a comedian and this is my medium of expression which I have used to remember some of the incidents, some funny, some emotional. <br />For Live shows Contact at booksundeepsharma@gmail.com <br />For Live show tickets of my current tour visit my website sharmasundeep.com <br />Credits: <br />Venue courtesy: The Habitat-Comedy and Music Cafe<br />Directed &amp; Edited by: Karan Asnani<br />Shot by: Dishang Popat, Vivian Castelino Harsh Shah and Karan Kundnani<br />Live sound recording: Yash Rajiv Barse, Siegen Moopnar<br />Sound mixing and mastering: Raghvendra Bhattacharya<br />Written and performed by: Sundeep Sharma <br /><br /><br />Follow Sundeep Sharma on:<br /><br />Facebook:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Sundeepshawarma/">https://www.facebook.com/Sundeepshawarma/</a><br /><br />Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sundeep.sharma/">https://www.instagram.com/sundeep.sharma/</a><br /><br />Twitter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/sundeepshawarma/">https://twitter.com/sundeepshawarma/</a><br /><br />#standupcomedy #father #fathersday #hindicomedy{% endraw %}
