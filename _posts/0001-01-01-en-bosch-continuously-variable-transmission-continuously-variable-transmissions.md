{% raw %}Continuously variable transmissions (CVTs) are stepless automatic transmissions with a Bosch pushbelt. By transmitting drive power efficiently from the engine to the wheels, CVTs reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by up to 7% compared with conventional manual transmissions -- and this without any loss of traction whatsoever. Compact and robust, with technology that is easy to apply, CVTs also cut cost and take up less of the valuable installation space available.<br /><br />This video in German: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/5ERSaTJC3eY">http://youtu.be/5ERSaTJC3eY</a>{% endraw %}
