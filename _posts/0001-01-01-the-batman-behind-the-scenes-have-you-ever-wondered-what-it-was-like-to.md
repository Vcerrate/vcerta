{% raw %}Have you ever wondered what it was like to be a part of a Batman movie? Well so did we - and that’s why we gathered some of the best and most awkward behind the scenes moments from Matt Reeves’ The Batman.<br />We’re absolutely thrilled to see a fresh take on the caped crusader’s story - and how the cast and crew brought it to life. With Robert Pattinson and Zoe Kravitz headlining the film - we can be certain for a good time. Pattinson and Kravitz have some very interesting moments they shared on set - which did end up being just a little too award for each other. But they weren’t the only two sharing some funny times behind the scenes. Colin Farrell even took his appearance public - making for a very tense moment with customers. Maybe all of these on set situations were just products of their characters - or maybe they just need a little comic relief from the shoot. In any case - we can be certain that they took their roles seriously.<br />So let’s jump on in and see all the love the cast and crew shared together. You’ll be happy to know that even though their on-screen characters have a bit of animosity for each other - they’re best buds off-screen. Have you ever wanted to be in a Batman movie? Why don’t you watch this first - and see what really happened in The Batman behind the scenes.<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Things">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Things</a><br /><br /><br />Chapters:<br /><br />00:00 Intro<br />00:19 Bruce Hits The Gym<br />01:01 Comic Book Aficionado<br />01:33 Home Sweet Home<br />01:55 Real Life Gotham<br />02:33 Pandemic Setbacks<br />03:11 The Human Cat<br />03:39 Who Is That?<br />04:14 A Flirty Punch<br />04:46 The Catwoman Movie?<br />05:13 So Much Sweat<br />05:42 Friendly Bats<br />06:13 Riddler’s Notes<br />06:40 Lighting Shadows<br />06:58 Penguin Loves Coffee<br />07:26 Cheat Sheet<br />08:10 End<br /><br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/">https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/</a><br /><br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thethings.com">https://www.thethings.com</a><br /><br />Written by: William Statzer<br />Narrated by: William Statzer<br />Edited by: William Statzer<br /><br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com{% endraw %}
