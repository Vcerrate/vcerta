{% raw %}Artist: Ill Nino<br />Song: Predisposed<br />Album: Revolution Revolucion <br /><br />▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃<br /><br />Lyrics: <br /><br />This is my time, this is my time<br />And now you'll go back where you came from<br />Now is the time to accept, I'm right<br />Was right<br />Por ser lo mas provocar was wrong<br />Was wrong<br />Everything's over and I feel sober<br />To start my life<br />That one step took me right there<br />True intentions are not predisposed to our fear<br />Searching without a cause<br />I will not stand here and be controlled<br />Inside<br />Lo necesito sin tu control<br />I'm not fine<br />Siento en me vena ninguna pena<br />Without a fear<br />A take that one step right there<br />True intentions are not predisposed to our fear<br />Searching without a cause<br />Like a game of chess I carved your chest<br />Don't snap back, pull the trigger into my neck<br />Bust your move, drop the news<br />It's a crying shame I'm feeling all the pain<br />And you want to slap my face<br />You'll try to put me in your place<br />Well I'll step back and then attack<br />This is my time to get my life back<br />True intentions are not predisposed to our fear<br />Searching without a cause<br /><br />▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃<br /><br />All rights to this song belongs to the artist.
