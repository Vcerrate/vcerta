{% raw %}&quot;Resurrender&quot; from Hillsong Worship’s live album &quot;These Same Skies&quot;, led by Brooke Ligertwood<br /><br />Whether in the northern or southern hemisphere, these same skies unite us, all of God’s children, as many as the stars in the sky, just as the Lord promised Abraham. It is under these same skies that Christ’s church, His body on earth, exists today. Though separated by oceans and borders the mandate of Hillsong Worship continues under these same skies. One in heart and spirit, unified in mission and cause—to glorify the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to build His Church, and to serve His Church with the new song.<br /><br />Listen to &quot;These Same Skies&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://worship.lnk.to/thesesameskiesID">https://worship.lnk.to/thesesameskiesID</a><br />Watch the latest from Hillsong Worship here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hillsong.lnk.to/ytplaylist">https://hillsong.lnk.to/ytplaylist</a><br />Click to subscribe to our channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://worship.lnk.to/subscribe">https://worship.lnk.to/subscribe</a><br /><br />Stay connected<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/hillsongworship">https://instagram.com/hillsongworship</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/hillsongworship">https://facebook.com/hillsongworship</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hillsongworship">https://twitter.com/hillsongworship</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hillsong.com/worship">https://hillsong.com/worship</a><br /><br />Resurrender<br />Words and Music by<br />Chris Davenport &amp; Brooke Ligertwood<br />© 2021 Hillsong MP Songs &amp; Hillsong Music Publishing Australia<br />CCLI: 7184447<br /><br />VERSE 1: <br />You’re turning over tables<br />And calling for return<br />To our lives upon the altar<br />The things we did at first<br />You’re clearing out the temple<br />You’re cleaning out the dirt<br />For we are Your territory<br />Lord we are Your Church <br /><br />CHORUS: <br />We are Your people<br />You are our God<br />We are Your temple<br />Make us holy like You are <br /> <br />VERSE 2: <br />You see a holy nation<br />A flock to consecrate<br />A chosen generation<br />A people called to pray<br />So help us God to please You<br />Where only You can see<br />For every moment matters in eternity<br /><br />CHORUS 2: <br />We are Your people<br />You are our God<br />We are Your temple<br />Make us holy like You are <br /><br />We are Your children<br />You’ve set us apart<br />God for Your glory<br />Make us holy like You are<br /><br />BRIDGE 1: <br />Mark Your people with Your presence<br />Make us a place where You delight to dwell<br />May we heed Your hand’s correction<br />Oh Lord our Shepherd <br />You do all things well<br /><br />Your love as firm as it is tender<br />Your law is perfect <br />And Your judgments true<br />As we run to resurrender<br />You will restore what we return to You<br />You are restoring as we yield anew<br /><br />BRIDGE 2:<br />If You’re calling <br />We’re coming<br />We’re not walking <br />We’re running<br />God we need resurrender <br />We resurrender<br /><br />#resurrender #thesesameskies #hillsongworship{% endraw %}
