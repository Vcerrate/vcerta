{% raw %}The Way of a Pilgrim is the English title of a 19th century anonymous Russian, seemingly autobiographical, work, possibly by an Athonite monk, detailing the narrator's journey across the country while practicing the Jesus Prayer devoutly, with the help of a prayer rope and the study of the Philokalia. The Russian title of the book is actually much longer than its English translation: &quot;Откровенные рассказы странника духовному своему отцу&quot; - literally, &quot;Candid tales of a pilgrim to his spiritual father'.<br /><br />This masterpiece, as described in Europe by theologians who are spiritually immersed in it, speaks of an Orthodox Christian pilgrim who travels with the thirst to delve into the knowledge and application of the saying of the Apostle Paul who says &quot;pray unceasingly&quot;{% endraw %}
