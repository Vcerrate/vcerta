{% raw %}Some sporting events are becoming less popular, like the Olympics, the Super Bowl or the &quot;world&quot; series, but others like the men's and women's football world cups, rugby u and cricket tournaments are on the rise. Many golf courses in countries like Great Britain are closing. Swimming has grown in some areas and is shrinking in others, in some cases pools are beginning to close permanently. Should you be worried? Will pools close in the next few years or will we see more and better swimming pools?<br /><br />Our dry-land channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank"
