{% raw %}Vietsub | A Thousand Years - Christina Perri | Lyrics: <br />Heart beats fast<br />Colors and promises<br />How to be brave<br />How can I love when I'm afraid to fall<br />But watching you stand alone<br />All of my doubt, suddenly goes away somehow<br />One step closer<br />I have died everyday, waiting for you<br />Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years<br />I'll love you for a thousand more<br />Time stands still<br />Beauty in all she is<br />I will be brave<br />I will not let anything, take away<br />What's standing in front of me<br />Every breath, every hour has come to this<br />One step closer<br />I have died everyday, waiting for you<br />Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years<br />I'll love you for a thousand more<br />And all along I believed, I would find you<br />Time has brought your heart to me, I have loved you for a thousand years<br />I'll love you for a thousand more<br />One step closer<br />One step closer<br />I have died everyday, waiting for you<br />Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years<br />I'll love you for a thousand more<br />And all along I believed, I would find you<br />Time has brought your heart to me, I have loved you for a thousand years<br />I'll love you for a thousand more<br /><br />#athousandyears #christinaperri #vietsub{% endraw %}
