{% raw %}On the 30th of July, 1945, the American Navy cruiser the USS Indianapolis was hit by two torpedoes fired by a Japanese submarine. The ship, with over 1,000 crewmen on board, sank into the ocean in little more than ten minutes, leaving around 900 sailors adrift and awaiting rescue. For those 900 or so men, the wait would be one of the longest and most challenging of their lives… an ordeal which only a fraction of those who lived through the sinking would survive.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:46 - Background<br />02:04 - The Sinking of The Indianapolis<br />07:15 - The Aftermath<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery.
