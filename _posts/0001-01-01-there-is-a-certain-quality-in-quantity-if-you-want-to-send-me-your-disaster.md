{% raw %}If you want to send me your disaster campaigns email it here. totalwarlegend@gmail.com<br /><br />Please only send campaigns on the verge of defeat or battles you can't win. Auto resolve wins won't be accepted. Modded campaigns are not currently accepted. Please only send campaigns/battles on large or ultra unit scale. Normal unit scale will not be accepted. <br /><br /><br />Please keep in mind the volume of emails I receive and that not all disaster submissions will receive a response. I will try to get to as many as possible. Feel free to &quot;bump&quot; your email once every 24 hours by responding to your submission with bump. Do not resend the save file multiple times as it will clog up my inbox storage. <br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gyazo.com/68c0fe6179bedc4ebab659f8935abbc5">https://gyazo.com/68c0fe6179bedc4ebab659f8935abbc5</a><br />This link will show you where your save file should be located.
