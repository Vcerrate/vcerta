{% raw %}Why LESS is MORE | A Monk Explains Minimalism<br /><br />In a world where we are taught to want more and acquire more, Buddhist monks on the other hand, seek the opposite. We want less. (and please understand the word &quot;want&quot; with proper context). In this video, I wanted to share how having less can bring peace.<br /><br />Many men from around the world have come to Thailand to ordain to be Buddhist monks, and many of them report that having less actually brought them inner peace. I wanted to share some insight into why that is. I hope you enjoy and can take this concept to apply to your daily life. #monks #monk #minimalist #buddhistmonks<br /><br />(Timestamp)<br />0:00 Intro<br />3:52 Difference between monks and lay people<br />4:32 Minimalism<br />10:20 One reason people suffer<br /><br /><br />______________________________________________________<br /><br />‚úÖ Venerable Nick‚Äôs Website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nickkeomahavong.com/">https://www.nickkeomahavong.com/</a><br /><br />______________________________________________________<br /><br />üî∂ Join the ‚ÄúMonk Life Thailand‚Äù ordination program, to experience the life of a monk in this 30 - 60 day training at the International Forest Monastery (iMonastery) located in Chiang Mai, Thailand:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.monklife.info/">https://www.monklife.info/</a><br /><br />üî∂ Join the Pa Pae Meditation Retreat if you would like to meditate in the beautiful nature of the Chiang Mai mountains.
