{% raw %}This is stop 3, the YETI Natural Selection Alaska. 14 of the world's best backcountry snowboarders went to battle, both against each other and the unforgiving backcountry terrain of The Last Frontier. Steep, sustained and featured terrain is Mother Nature's venue there, as 8 men and 4 women went head-to-head to find out who has what it takes to stand atop the podium. The riders battle it out for the win of the final Tour stop in AK and we will also crown the Overall Natural Selection Tour champion based off of the results from all three stops of this season. While Alaska is the final stop of the 2022 Tour, it's far from over. We're just getting started. <br /><br />X Games — your destination for all things action sports, music, lifestyle and everything in between. <br /><br />Visit our official homepage at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://xgames.com">http://xgames.com</a> for more coverage and highlights.<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/XGames">https://www.youtube.com/XGames</a><br /><br />Check us on Social @XGames:<br />Instagram ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/xgames">https://instagram.com/xgames</a><br />Twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/xgames">https://twitter.com/xgames</a><br />Facebook ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/XGames">https://facebook.com/XGames</a><br />TikTok ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@XGames">https://www.tiktok.com/@XGames</a><br />Snapchat ► @xgames<br /><br />Thanks for watching #XGames!{% endraw %}
