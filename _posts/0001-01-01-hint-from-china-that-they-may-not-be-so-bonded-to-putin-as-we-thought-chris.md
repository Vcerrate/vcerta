{% raw %}Sky News host Chris Smith says we got an “inkling” from China today that they may not be so “bonded” to Russian President Vladimir Putin as we thought.  <br /><br />Mr Smith said Beijing’s Foreign Minister acknowledged there was a war in Ukraine, and they hoped the fighting and the war stopped as soon as possible. <br /><br />“But how about they pick up the telephone to their new best friend in Moscow and tell him directly to stop killing innocent Ukrainians and stop the war. <br /><br />“We can only hope that China becomes the most unexpected saviour for the Ukrainian people; it could be a stretch.&quot;{% endraw %}
