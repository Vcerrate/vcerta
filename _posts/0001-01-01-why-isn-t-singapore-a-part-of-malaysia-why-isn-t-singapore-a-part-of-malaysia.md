{% raw %}Why isn't Singapore a Part of Malaysia?<br /><br />If you wanted to travel to Singapore from Malaysia, your best bet would be using the Johor Causeway Bridge. It’s only 1 kilometer long and would have you there in no time. A flight from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia to Singapore takes just an hour.<br />The two countries are on each other’s doorsteps and share many cultural, historical and ethnic similarities. <br />However, they remain separate, and it is unlikely that they will unite – at least in the immediate future.<br />This wasn’t always the case though. In 1963 Singapore joined the Malaysia Federation in what was to be a short-lived merger. Just two years later Singapore separated due to irreconcilable differences and became an independent state.<br /><br /><br />Background Music:<br /><br />Kevin MacLeod - Echoes of Time<br />Kevin MacLeod - Decisions{% endraw %}
