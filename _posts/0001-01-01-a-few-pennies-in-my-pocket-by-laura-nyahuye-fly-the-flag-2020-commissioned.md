{% raw %}Commissioned by Talking Birds for Fly The Flag 2020<br /><br />#humanrightsday #flytheflag<br />On 10 December 2020, Fly The Flag launches a series of specially commissioned poems in response to Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, igniting conversations and reminding us that even in times of crisis we must protect the rights of everyone.<br /><br />Article 25 <br />We all have the right to a good life, with enough food, clothing, housing, and healthcare. Mothers and children, people without work, old and disabled people all have the right to help.<br />Simplified version by Amnesty International UK <br /><br />Fly The Flag is a unique collaboration between arts organisations and human rights charities which celebrates and reminds us of the human rights we all share. Launched in 2018 on the 70th anniversary of the ratification of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), Fly The Flag is a reminder of the human rights we all entitled to, in particular raising awareness of the UDHR amongst young people and shining a light where human rights are violated.<br /><br />www.flytheflag.org.uk{% endraw %}
