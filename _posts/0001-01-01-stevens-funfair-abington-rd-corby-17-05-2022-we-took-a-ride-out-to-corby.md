{% raw %}We took a ride out to Corby to visit Stevens Funfair thats on there till the 22nd of may , awesome fare , amazing value too with most rides being a snip at Â£2.50 ,  had a top notch line up with Craig Danters Oxygen booster and Superbowl , Leigh Danters Superstar running an awesome cycle , John Guests flat front Maxwell Waltzer , first time on one and its was a great ride but mess's with your head ,  the always stunning Ice Jet running better than ever , Joel Bunns Tagada looking as good as ever, Parrishes 6 arm Extreme, 2 ghost trains, miami, dodgems , Whyatts Yeti frogs, stevens sizzler .  Its a massive line up and well worth a visit and to top everything off Ethan destroyed Alex's ego on the boxing machine which went down well ,  the fair is there till the 22nd if you can pay it a visit , its well worth the trip.{% endraw %}
