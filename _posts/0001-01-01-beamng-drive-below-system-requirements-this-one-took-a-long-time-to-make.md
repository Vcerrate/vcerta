{% raw %}This one took a long time to make, hopefully you like it! I've become very interested lately in different PC setups and especially interested to see how they will run the games I enjoy, such as BeamNG.drive. Thankfully the game is very scalable and will play on basically anything at the lowest settings. The NVIDIA GT 610 is probably not the best for this type of thing but it was fun to stress it out with BeamNG at max settings, even though that didn't last long.... <br /><br />Zotac.... hit me up for a sponsorship....
