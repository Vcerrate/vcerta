{% raw %}My adventures in The Democratic Republic of Congo went about as expected. We wanted to travel to undiscovered places for 3 weeks, and we ended up being labeled as spies, fled to the jungle, had to trade a crocodile for a bed, and got lost along the way. While in the cities, I tried to visit local markets to get a feel for the place. Near the end of the adventure, we found a Pangolin at a bush meat market. I couldn't handle watching this amazing animal die in a bag, so we tried to save it. This is that story.<br /><br />Pangolins are endangered creatures, and are the most highly trafficked animals in the world. Hunted mostly for their scales on the black market, this is not what happens here. In this part of Congo, it's primarily just for food.<br /><br />Maybe I could have made a better decision. Was buying the pangolin right or wrong? Was it better to try and save it, or just leave it?
