It swings down over the stock that needs to be cut and is self adjusting. When it's not needed, it swings up against the wall out of the way. <br />I still need to make a clamping system for smaller panels (especially angled cuts) and an outfeed table for support under the track.<br /><br />▶️ Project plans for sale: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ibuildit.ca/plans/">https://ibuildit.ca/plans/</a><br />▶️Support the work I do on Locals:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ibuildit.locals.com/">https://ibuildit.locals.com/</a><br />▶️ Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=865843&amp;ty=h">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=865843&amp;ty=h</a><br />▶️ Join my Makers Mob for detailed build tutorials:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.themakersmob.com/john-heisz-i-build-it/?via=ibuildit">https://go.themakersmob.com/john-heisz-i-build-it/?via=ibuildit</a><br /><br />My &quot;Scrap bin&quot; channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/IBuildItScrapBin">https://www.youtube.com/c/IBuildItScrapBin</a><br /><br />#ibuildit<br />#woodworking<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ibuildit.ca/">https://ibuildit.ca/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/I-Build-It-258048014240900/">https://www.facebook.com/I-Build-It-258048014240900/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/i_build_it.ca/">https://www.instagram.com/i_build_it.ca/</a>{% endraw %}
