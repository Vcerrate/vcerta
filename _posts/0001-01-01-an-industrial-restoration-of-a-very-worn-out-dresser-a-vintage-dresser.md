{% raw %}A vintage dresser is restored and given a new rustic industrial look, featuring a restoration of antique cast iron castors.<br /><br />When I found this dresser on FB Marketplace, I noticed that it was entirely solid wood. No MDF, no particle board, all 100% solid. Whenever I run across a piece like this, my first thought is to restore it and bring out the wood hiding underneath. Since all the black stained surfaces were solid, sanding through the stain and minor scratches wouldn't be an issue. However, there were some major cracks along the top and sides. When I plan on painting, this isn't a problem since the cracks can be patched up with some Bondo and painted over to hide the damage. For a restoration, it's much more difficult to repair major damages AND hide it. My solution was to first use wood epoxy to match the wood color as much as possible, and then go with a rustic look by creating wormholes and other marks of character all around the dresser. Doing this effectively camouflaged whatever major damages that were fixed, and I love the dark accents that they created once the dark wax was applied.<br /><br />I hope you found some value in this video, and thank you for watching! :)<br /><br />- Andy<br /><br />----------<br />Below is a list of the tools and products that I used. <br /><br />Square Ruler: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3LDSszc">https://amzn.to/3LDSszc</a><br />Dremel Ultra-Saw: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3wlm8IC">https://amzn.to/3wlm8IC</a><br />Wire Brush Wheel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3LmgUUr">https://amzn.to/3LmgUUr</a><br />WD-40 White Lithium Grease: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3wIdVBQ">https://amzn.to/3wIdVBQ</a><br />DeWalt Orbit Sander: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3D1Pgcp">https://amzn.to/3D1Pgcp</a><br />Goo Gone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3INvt1M">https://amzn.to/3INvt1M</a><br />Wood Epoxy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2TkYM8m">https://amzn.to/2TkYM8m</a><br /><br />As a disclaimer, the above links are affiliate links, so if you make a purchase with the links provided, I receive a small commission.
