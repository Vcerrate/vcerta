{% raw %}The most recent episode of The Joe Rogan Experience featured playwright and filmmaker David Mamet and Rogan talking about how much they hate California’s left-leaning social policies, at one point calling it an Orwellian State with 1984-esque practices. Mamet took his assault on “the Left” even further by calling it a “death cult” that believes that the Sun is killing them, taking a jab at climate change activists and environmentalists. Ana Kasparian and John Iadarola discuss on The Young Turks.

Rogan even shared a story about getting frustrated with his former state (he now resides in Texas) after his 9-year-old daughter was told by her school that it’s not enough to simply not be racist.<br /><br />“When the whole George Floyd thing happened, one of the schools that my kids were going to back in California released this email, saying that it’s not enough to not be racist, you now must be anti-racist. And my kid’s nine at the time. What does that, what does that mean?” Rogan said at one point during a conversation that covered everything from transgenderism to religion in modern society.<br /><br />Rogan and Mamet chalked such efforts up to virtue signaling, with the playwright saying the “anti-racist” request is meaningless.<br /><br />“Now here they are saying they’re going to tackle something, not just tackle something as complex as race in America, but you’re going to establish rules that you can’t just be not racist, you have to be anti-racist, and you’re going to teach this to a 9-year-old,” Rogan added. “So what are you saying? Like, what exactly are you saying, what is your f****** end goal?”&quot;<br /><br />*** <br /><br />The largest online progressive news show in the world. Hosted by Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian.
