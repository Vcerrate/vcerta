{% raw %}The all-new compact SUV Alfa Romeo Tonale 2023 interior is officially shown but without all color options and details. After presentation in Feb 20202, we collected all media materials together in one video review and illustrated the Tonale interior with most popular colors.<br /><br />Let's take a look what's inside the new Alfa Romeo SUV. Btw, here is what written in press release:<br /><br />The interior design is inspired by the Alfa Romeo racing heritage, focusing on the driver as well as on the comfort of their passengers. Telescopic instrument panel, Alfa Romeo stylistic matrix, and 3-spoke sports steering wheel with aluminium shift paddles provide an immersive, welcoming and dynamic interior.<br /><br />#AlfaRomeo #AlfaRomeoTonale #AlfaRomeoTonale2023 #AlfaRomeoTonaleInterior AlfaRomeoTonale2022{% endraw %}
