{% raw %}Everyone in business creates invoices for their customers. Amongst all the line items are a few items whose pricing is quite well known to the customer.<br /><br />In the video, it's about coke, whose pricing is well known to everyone. Amongst all the items if we misquote the price of coke the client would never trust us as he is not really able to check and compare the pricing of other expensive items.<br /><br />Get the price of your coke right and retain customers and make them trust you.<br /><br />Concept by: Biju Jayaraaj{% endraw %}
