{% raw %}The audio is from the 2001 Astley remaster of &quot;The Album&quot;. The main virtue of this remaster is that Astley used the original studio tapes and not the distorted LP master tapes that were used virtually for all the LP pressings of &quot;The Album&quot; and most available CD remasters (Including the latest Deluxe). Therefore the sound is clean without the usual distortions (such as on &quot;What's the name of the game, does it mean anything to you&quot; lines), but the downside being that Astley compressed the dynamics and used noise reduction, though not as badly in my opinion as sometimes claimed.<br /><br />Watch in 1080p!{% endraw %}
