Spread over 28 tracks and clocking in at just under one hour, this body of work provides a glimpse into the mind of one of the UK’s most talented, enigmatic producers. <br /><br />Al Dobson’s debut mini album marked the inauguration of Bradley Zero’s fledgling label back in 2014, proving to be a breath of fresh air to the london scene with it’s loose, undefinable sound and unique approach to production. <br /><br />As a newcomer, Al Dobson Jr.’s music didn’t remain a secret for long, with major global tastemakers such as Gilles Peterson, Theo Parrish, Dego, Alex Nut and Osunlade being early adopters. As with other key releases on 22a and Izwid, it didn’t take long for Rye Lane Volume 1 to go from obscure debut to cult classic, propelling the artist and the label onto the international platform. <br /><br />At once a continuation and evolution of the sound, Rye Lane Volumes II &amp; III offers a deeper exploration into the Al Dobson Jr universe, moving with ease through tempos and textures but never losing that effortless magic that makes ADJ stand out from the crowd.{% endraw %}
