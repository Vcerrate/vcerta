Could Johnny change his mind about working with Disney OR is he saying goodbye to Captain Jack Sparrow for good?<br /><br />Almost immediately after Amber published her op-ed in December 2018, Disney dropped Johnny from Pirates of the Caribbean 6 - a move that Johnny called a betrayal.<br /><br /><br />subscribe for celeb drama: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/channel/UCylyoo597NuFFyJS_HwHubQ?sub_confirmation=1">http://youtube.com/channel/UCylyoo597NuFFyJS_HwHubQ?sub_confirmation=1</a>{% endraw %}
