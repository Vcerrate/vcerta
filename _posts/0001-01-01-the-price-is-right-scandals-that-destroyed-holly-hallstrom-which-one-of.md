When it was finally time for her to leave The Price Is Right, she had nothing nice to say about her boss or the workplace that which she had devoted so much of her life to.<br /><br />Holy briefly tried her hand at acting in the early 80s, but nothing ever really amounted from that. With her tail between her legs, she had to return to The Price is Right in 1984 even though she had fully expected to leave the show for good. Likely, her relationship with Barker was put under strain after that. In 1995, Hallstrom would leave The Price Is Right for good – and for the next decade, she would fight Barker in court for what she saw as wrongful termination and mistreatment.
