{% raw %}Explanation of the operating principle!<br />You will find the description below:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.griessbach-luckenwalde.de/en/development/hall-switch-concept/">https://www.griessbach-luckenwalde.de/en/development/hall-switch-concept/</a><br /><br />In the video we present you our new principle of action, which reliably protects the hall sensor in control elements against external field influence. The innovative magnet and sensor arrangement prevents magnetically induced switching errors without special shielding measures. Thus, the wear-free switching technology can be conveniently integrated into a wide range of conventional switches and push-buttons - from pushbuttons on rotary, dial and slide switch to the usual in vehicle operation rocker switch. Redundancy and diagnostic capability ensure a high performance level for functional safety. The fail-safe switching concept is also suitable for actuating travel of only 1mm, heights of 10 mm and switching diameter from 8 mm.{% endraw %}
