{% raw %}Tennis elbow also known as lateral epicondylitis is a painful condition of the elbow caused by overuse.  It is a condition in which the outer part of the elbow becomes painful and tender at the lateral epicondyle.  Because of the shorted extensor muscles on the back of the forearm, it is very common that the carpal bones in the wrist become misaligned and subluxated.  This causes more tension on the muscles that attach into the elbow region.  I have attached some videos below to make sure your wrists are moving correctly. <br /><br />How to Adjust Your Wrist, Hand, &amp; Fingers and Become Pain Free<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbmH_jNbZko">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbmH_jNbZko</a><br /><br />Wrist and Carpal Tunnel Self Correction<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHVtzOCGy0Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHVtzOCGy0Y</a><br /><br />Retinaculum Release for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Wrist, Hand Pain (Self-Help)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i1sba1NfMM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i1sba1NfMM</a><br /><br />Make sure you like us on facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/motivationaldoc/">https://www.facebook.com/motivationaldoc/</a><br />Please leave your reviews if you wouldn't mind taking the time.
