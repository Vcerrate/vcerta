{% raw %}While the NFT space is fairly new to people, the concept of why digital items have real-world value has been around for over a decade. People have been buying digital items in games for years for no reason other than self-expression and to communicate with others visually. It's the reason why people buy sheep in Farmville, or character skins on Fortnite. These items are not tangible,  yet people want these digital goods because it lets them standout from the rest and expresses themselves in a unique manner. The same goes for NFTs and the things people are buying through the blockchain.<br />—<br />► Check out my main YouTube channel here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://garyvee.com/youtubeGaryveeSUB">http://garyvee.com/youtubeGaryveeSUB</a><br /><br />—<br />Gary Vaynerchuk is a serial entrepreneur and the Chairman of VaynerX, a modern day communications parent company, as well as the CEO and Co-Founder of VaynerMedia, a full-service digital agency servicing Fortune 500 clients across the company’s 4 locations.<br /><br />Gary is a venture capitalist, 5-time New York Times bestselling author, and an early investor in companies such as Twitter, Tumblr, Venmo and Uber.
