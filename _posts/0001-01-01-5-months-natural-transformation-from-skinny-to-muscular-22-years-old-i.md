{% raw %}I hope this video inspired you, only I know how hard it was to get here...<br />The big problem is mentality, people don't understand that. I STAYED 22 YEARS LIKE A PATIENT at 43kg without being able to enjoy life. I did not miss a day at the gym ! why ? Suddenly like that? NO, SOMETHING HAS CHANGED and made me the man I am now, who no longer needs motivation and needs nothing to achieve his desires. FIX your minset and achive ANYTHING you want. U will have no more excuses after you apply what's inside AND NO IS NOT SOME MOTIVATIONAL IRRELEVANT BU*LSHIT. Specific techniques to train your mind so that it breaks the mediocre patterns of today's society, and to help you grow DAILY in all fields with constant FOCUS. it's cheap for WHAT'S INSIDE and is part of my life, don't make my MISTAKES ! Do you have 15$ YES OR NO?
