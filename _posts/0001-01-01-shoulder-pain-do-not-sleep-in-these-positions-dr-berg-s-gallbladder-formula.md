This duct becomes plugged and leads to pressure on the phrenic nerve, which goes right up into your neck. When this nerve is irritated it can cause shoulder pain. It’s important to get on the keto diet and do intermittent fasting to help reduce this pressure. You may also need purified bile salts or a Gallbladder Formula. <br /><br />There is a simple hanging exercise you can do for a problem that is in your shoulder and is not referred. I believe this is the best exercise for shoulder pain (I cover this exercise in the video). <br /><br />Inflammation in the shoulder could be caused by something you ate the day before. Reducing omega-6 fatty acids and increasing omega-3 fatty acids is essential. One of the best natural remedies for inflammation that I’ve found is stinging nettle root. Keto and intermittent fasting are also essential. Vitamin D3 in combination with vitamin K2 can also be beneficial. <br /><br />Tips for sleeping if you have shoulder pain:<br /> 1. Don’t sleep on your side with all of your pressure on the shoulder joint. Instead, tuck your shoulder in about 2 inches forward.<br /> 2. Make sure your head is neutral with your spine. <br /> 3. Roll up a small towel or washcloth and put it under your neck to provide support and take pressure off the shoulder.<br /> 4. Roll up a small towel or washcloth and put it underneath your shoulder on your ribcage. <br /> 5. Don’t have your head too far forward or backward.<br /> 6. Invest in a good-quality pillow. <br /> 7. Don’t sleep on your stomach. <br /> 8. Don’t sleep on your back with your hands under your head. <br /> 9. Sleep with a pillow between your knees. <br /><br />The best position to sleep in if you have shoulder pain:<br />On your side with your head on a good pillow and in a neutral position, your shoulders tucked forward, with a rolled towel under your neck and a rolled towel under your ribcage, and a pillow between your knees.<br /><br />Follow Me On Social Media:<br />Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/FB-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/FB-DrBerg</a><br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/IG-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/IG-DrBerg</a><br /><br />ADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3FyMdby">https://bit.ly/3FyMdby</a><br />FREE COURSE➜ ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse">http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse</a><br /><br />Talk to a Dr. Berg Keto Consultant today and get the help you need on your journey.
