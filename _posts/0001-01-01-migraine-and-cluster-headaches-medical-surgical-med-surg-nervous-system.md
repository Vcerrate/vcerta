During my time at CSUSM's Accelerated Bachelor's of Nursing program, I helped my fellow classmates who were struggling with the exam, pass and graduate. After receiving my BSN I went on to become an RN at Scripps Encinitas Hospital. As more and more students reached out to me for help, I decided to start this channel to help people across the world, LEVEL UP. <br /><br />👋 STAY CONNECTED 👋<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fb.me/LevelUpRN">https://fb.me/LevelUpRN</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/leveluprn/">https://www.instagram.com/leveluprn/</a> <br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/leveluprn/">https://www.pinterest.com/leveluprn/</a><br /><br />#Nervous #Migraine<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:24 Migraine Headache<br />4:33 Cluster Headache<br />6:36 Quiz time!{% endraw %}
