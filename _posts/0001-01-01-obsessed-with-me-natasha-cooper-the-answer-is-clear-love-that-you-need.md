{% raw %}#YouTubeDrama #MRB #Merb #MommyRamblingsBlog #BestCommunityOnYouTube <br /><br />Natasha Cooper needs me for content. I love it. She hates me but knows she is nothing if she is not talking about me, making fun of me or trying to rip me apart. No matter what she knows she needs me and knows she cannot stop talking about me or her channel will fall apart more than it is. She knows her views are dropping, she knows there is a new Queen of Mean in town that is better than her in every way. She knows her days are numbered and she is getting so desperate. She has to talk about me to keep her numbers in some kind of range that she deems acceptable because she is obsessed with watching nuimbers. She is not here for the long term, in fact her channel is winding down and circling the drain. A channel with no content like hers, one that just rips people apart will never last, it is just a flash in the pan and the gas under her pan is down to simmer and fading fast. Enjoy the casino today shug, we know you are eaten up inside with hate and anxiety. You can give your sermon on other channels attacking your looks but when you do the same before and after, you show yourself off to be a fraud. I am so happy you are having a whole craft night dedicated to me, you prove me right and that just shows everyone I am telling the truth about you. <br /><br />Fair Use Disclaimer:<br />Any news coverage, interviews, information from books or articles or media we use is used only for news reporting, research and educational purposes in accordance with the Fair Use Act.
