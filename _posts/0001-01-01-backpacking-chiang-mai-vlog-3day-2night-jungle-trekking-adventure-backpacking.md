I spend half my time exploring new places around the globe with my backpack, and the other half creating videos about my experiences, what I'm packing, solo travel advice, money budgeting tips and anything else in relation to my backpacking lifestyle. <br />Get to know me more here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.backpackingbananas.com/about">https://www.backpackingbananas.com/about</a><br /><br />FAQ's<br />How do you afford to travel? - I now earn a full time living through creating these YouTube videos, affiliate links, selling digital products and my clothing line. I used to simply just work any temporary job I could find to save up to travel! I budget the money I earn meticulously to reach my savings goals using <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.backpackingbananas.com/product-page/life-budget-tracker-uk-self-assessment-version">https://www.backpackingbananas.com/product-page/life-budget-tracker-uk-self-assessment-version</a><br />Is travelling solo safe? - I would argue the answer is almost always yes! As long as you use your common sense and you follow your own government's guidelines about travelling in that country. I have made several videos on backpacking safety on my channel.<br />Do you have plans to settle down? Yes, I'm currently saving to purchase my first property in the UK and I'd love to have children one day. I doubt I'll ever live a completely 'conventional' lifestyle by society's standards though, as I often have my own preferred way of doing things.<br /><br />CONTACT 📧<br />If you have a question about travel, join the backpackers forum! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://backpackingbananas.com/forum">https://backpackingbananas.com/forum</a><br />EMAIL: Business enquiries only please - hello@backpackingbananas.com<br /><br />Some of the links in the description are affiliate links that I get a small kickback from.{% endraw %}
