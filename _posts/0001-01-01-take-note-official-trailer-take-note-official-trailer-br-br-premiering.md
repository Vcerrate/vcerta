{% raw %}Take Note Official Trailer<br /><br />Premiering  February 24, 2022 on Peacock<br /><br />14-year-old Calvin Richards has a wonderful, close-knit family who can survive anything as long as they’re together. And good thing because Calvin was chosen to compete on a tween reality singing show – “Take Note” - and they’re going to spend the summer navigating the crazy ups and downs of new friendships and competitions, while being thrust into the national spotlight.<br /><br />#officialtrailer #takenote #peacock{% endraw %}
