{% raw %}Our guest surgeons from France have an innovative use of the 3D viewing systems to help patients with severe postural issues. In the cases shown here, the patients have extreme kyphosis and other maladies which prevent them from lying supine for ocular surgery. The surgeons position the patient at a comfortable angle and then adjust the microscope so that they can get a good video of the surgery. There are some caveats, however, such as adjustment of bottle height for phaco systems with gravity based infusion.{% endraw %}
