{% raw %}Did you know the forces of nature like wind or weather change the physical structure of how things look over time? In this video for kids, you will learn all about the processes of weathering and erosion. You will discover that there are three main types of weathering and three main types of erosion. The two process seem pretty similar, but they are actually different. But they practically work together to both destroy landforms and create new ones! <br /><br />The three types of weathering are chemical, mechanical, and biological. Chemical weathering changes minerals inside or on the surface of rocks. Mechanical weathering is caused by ice, the sun's heat, and a couple other natural forces. Biological weathering involves plants and animals, as well as humans. It is called &quot;biological&quot; because this type of weathering happens because of a living organism. For instance, a tree root growing out of a rock is slowly breaking that rock into smaller pieces. <br /><br />The three main causes of erosion are water, wind, and ice. Water can cause erosion through rainfall, rivers, and floods. The force of water pushes or pulls rocks and sediment to a new location. Wind similarly picks up and carries loose particles and dust. And glaciers are constantly moving and shifting, which causes erosion too!<br /><br />We hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning how the earth changes!
