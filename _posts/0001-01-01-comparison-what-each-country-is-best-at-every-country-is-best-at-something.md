{% raw %}Every country is best at something, therefor today we're going to show you what each country is best at/known for. Putting every country in the list would have made the video very long. So we chose the top 40 countries where our audiences are from. Hope no one gets offended for not including their country.<br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This Timeline/Comparison is based on public data, surveys, public comments &amp; discussions and approximate estimations that might be subjected to some degree of error.<br /><br />Subscribe to Infinite Comparison for more comparison/timeline videos.<br /><br />Icons: www.flaticon.com{% endraw %}
