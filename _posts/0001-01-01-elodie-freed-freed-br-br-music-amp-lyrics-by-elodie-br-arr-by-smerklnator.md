{% raw %}Freed<br /><br />music &amp; lyrics by Elodie<br />arr. by smerklnator<br /><br />Missing freedom is a feeling all of us share since the pandemic has started . I wrote this song at the very beginning of this time, since I wasn't used to such a situation I felt lost and as if nothing could help me to get out of it . I just wanted to be freed . Not exactly freed from the pandemic, but freed from my thoughts .<br /><br />Elodie - vocals &amp; violin<br />Juliana - piano<br />Jonathan - guitar<br />Alida - Cello<br />Mia - accordeon &amp; harp<br />Agnes - dance &amp; choreography{% endraw %}
