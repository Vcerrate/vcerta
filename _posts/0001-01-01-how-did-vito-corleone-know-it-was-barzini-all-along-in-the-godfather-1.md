{% raw %}In the Godfather 1, we are introduced to the behind the scenes of the dark criminal empire run by the notorious don Vito Corleone. <br /><br />We all watched the intriguing series of events unfold, and the story was brilliantly made by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, based on the iconic work of Mario Puzo the creator of the original novel. <br /><br />But there is something that until today has us wondering, a question that wasn't clearly answered and still captivates many debates. That question is, how did Don Vito instinctively know that the individual behind all these treacherous events was not the obvious Philip Tattaglia, rather the more cunning, Don Emilio Barzini?<br /><br />After his refusal to enter a partnership deal with Philip Tattaglia and Virgil Sollozzo, a hit is placed on him. Even though he miraculously survived the Corleone family is much weaker and has become the target.  However after a series of events unfold , Don Vito needed to step in while still not fully recovered, in order to prevent his empire from collapsing. He calls a meeting with the heads of the 5 families, who rule over New York. At this meeting Vito goes in to make peace with the other families in order to safely bring back his son Michael from his exile in Sicily. But Vito’s goal and intentions behind the meeting were not limited to the reasons he gave the other Dons. Vito needed to verify who was behind these lethal attacks on his family. He knew the other dons fairly well, and these attacks seemed to be far more sophisticated and treacherous than the obvious  for a man like Philip Tattaglia to have put in place. So if his suspicions were true, then his real enemy is yet to reveal himself…<br /><br />And so, that’s exactly what we will uncover in this video. <br />After watching this video you will know How and Why, Don Vito was able to uncover such a well laid out plot. Taking you through his thought process and allowing us to learn from this scenario. <br /> <br />𝑬𝒏𝒋𝒐𝒚 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒗𝒊𝒅𝒆𝒐 &amp; 𝑳𝒆𝒕 𝒖𝒔 𝒌𝒏𝒐𝒘 𝒘𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒀𝒐𝒖 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒌?🔥<br /><br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />📸 𝐉𝐨𝐢𝐧 𝐔𝐬 𝐎𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚 @𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐂𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐌𝐚𝐟𝐢𝐚<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/theculturemafia/">https://www.instagram.com/theculturemafia/</a><br /><br />𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐅𝐨𝐫 𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠<br /><br /><br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br />All materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
