{% raw %}A simple pedalboard build with just three pedals… then a gig!<br /><br />Life too short for long YouTube videos? Please see the ‘Interesting bits and go-to sections’ information below.<br /><br />Welcome to the show! In this video I pick up from a previous show where Dan helped me pick a small bunch of pedals for an upcoming show. For a recap, that video is here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/clO_-EN4aCM">https://youtu.be/clO_-EN4aCM</a><br /><br />Having chosen the pedals it’s time to build the board, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to go over some pedalboard building basics.<br />Erm, except then I choose some different pedals… and then change them again! If nothing else it’s a reminder why simple, modular pedalboards can be so much fun - swap things in and out as you choose with minimum hassle. <br />Anyway, having finally decided, I do a little bit of pre-gig prep and head to the show! <br />Massive thanks to Neville Marten and Adrian Nash for having me along at their show. Also thanks to Komedia Bath for being such an awesome venue with wonderful, helpful people. <br /><br />Why did the Clockwork Echo stop working? No idea. I will investigate when I get some time. <br /><br />Enjoy the show!<br />And please visit That Pedal Shop! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thatpedalshop.com/">https://www.thatpedalshop.com/</a><br /><br />Pedals used in this episode…<br />• D’Addario PW-CT-23 Pedal Tuner<br />UK &amp; Europe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ImY4us">https://bit.ly/3ImY4us</a><br />Australia: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/369VFGH">https://bit.ly/369VFGH</a><br />USA That Pedal Shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3Ig31FH">https://bit.ly/3Ig31FH</a><br /><br />• Kingtone The Duellist<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kingtoneguitar.com/product/the-duellist-pedal-board-friendly/">https://www.kingtoneguitar.com/product/the-duellist-pedal-board-friendly/</a><br /><br />• Gtown Custom Amps HolyGrail DualDrive<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gtown-amps.com/holygrail-dualdrive/">https://www.gtown-amps.com/holygrail-dualdrive/</a><br /><br />• J Rockett Clockwork Echo<br />UK &amp; Europe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/356sqUq">https://bit.ly/356sqUq</a><br />Australia: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3taCyDx">https://bit.ly/3taCyDx</a><br />USA That Pedal Shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3FQb5Mp">https://bit.ly/3FQb5Mp</a><br /><br />• Catalinbread Belle Epoch Deluxe<br />UK &amp; Europe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2RVldeS">http://bit.ly/2RVldeS</a><br />Australia: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Ovelqa">http://bit.ly/2Ovelqa</a><br />USA That Pedal Shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/308PeAy">https://bit.ly/308PeAy</a><br /><br />• Free The Tone Custom SOV-2 Overdrive<br />Discontinued<br /><br />• Free The Tone Flight Time Digital Delay<br />UK &amp; Europe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ierWyR">https://bit.ly/3ierWyR</a><br /><br />• D’Addario XPand Pedalboards<br />UK &amp; Europe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/351ki7v">https://bit.ly/351ki7v</a><br />USA That Pedal Shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3u1araE">https://bit.ly/3u1araE</a><br /><br /><br />Interesting bits and go-to sections…<br />0:00 What are we doing today?<br />1:30 Power supply overkill?<br />2:40 XPND Pedalboard – will it fit?<br />5;45 Fitting anything underneath?<br />7:43 Placement of pedals?<br />10:00 Placement of tuner?<br />11:14 Attaching pedals to the board<br />14:40 Rubbery pedal base?<br />16:10 Power supply?<br />16:40 Current draw of your pedals?<br />18:15 Cable accessibility<br />23:10 Check the power<br />24:00 Patch cables?<br />26:17 Plugging in for the first time<br />32:25 Different overdrive pedal?<br />34:25 Gig day prep<br />35:25 Sound check<br />36:35 Gig time!<br />40:52 Post-gig thoughts<br />43:23 Why change the pedals again?<br />44:10 New delay pedal settings<br />45:20 Yet another overdrive?!<br />47:00 Does anyone care?<br /><br /><br />Guitars in this episode:<br />• Fender Custom Shop ’62 Relic Stratocaster - Mick’s video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/amCnjNQCmiE">https://youtu.be/amCnjNQCmiE</a><br /><br />Amps in this episode: <br />• Two-Rock Classic Reverb Signature &amp; 112 cabinet / WGS12L speaker<br /><br />We hope you enjoy this episode.
