{% raw %}The Aries New Moon at 11 degrees is conjunct Chiron and Mercury, adding an interesting mix of focus to your sense of self. A new understanding of who you are now is emerging, especially as Chiron has already been in this area of your chart and has required you to see something differently in yourself. Mercury is fast moving in Aries, and you could feel like life gets really busy during this first week of April. The Sun and Moon are ready to begin a whole new cycle, but it is necessary to be conscious of what you are beginning and that it truly resonates with you.<br /><br />Mars, the ruler of Aries, is approaching a conjunction to Saturn in Aquarius which emphasizes a slow-down, as well as ongoing relationship reprogramming with Venus within orb to Saturn. Work is still required. Intentional choices and actions are important as April gets started.
