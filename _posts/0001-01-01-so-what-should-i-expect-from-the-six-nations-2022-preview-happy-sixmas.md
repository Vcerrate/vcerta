{% raw %}Happy Sixmas Eve! One day until the 2022 Six Nations starts, and it's one of the most competitive, hard to call we've maybe ever seen. So, as the tournament approaches, what are Scotland adding to their game, how may England and Italy's new tribes fair, are France finally favourites, why are Ireland like Girls Aloud, and just how is everyone going to manage to lose to Wales again?<br /><br />If you've enjoyed any of the channel's content, you can also support Squidge Rugby on Patreon by visiting <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/SquidgeRugby,">https://www.patreon.com/SquidgeRugby,</a> you guys make the amount I'll be putting out the next month or so feasible.{% endraw %}
