{% raw %}The patient at risk and resuscitation team (PAART) at the Royal Free are celebrating both the success of an app they have developed to help fight the disease and being awarded for a national Nursing Times award. The following film demonstrates the six interventions for patients who are suffering severe sepsis. The steps are patient receives oxygen, intravenous antibiotics and fluid resuscitation, have blood cultures taken and fluid balance and blood lactate measured.<br /><br />The number one aim of our staff is to provide world class care to every patient, every day. However the trust has recognised that sepsis is sometimes hard to diagnose and the six medical interventions need to be delivered quickly, in a high pressure environment -- that is why a tool such as the app is a valuable bedside aid.{% endraw %}
