{% raw %}Justin Hughes the type of American that we can all look up to.  His pride for America runs deep, all the way back to grade school.  After moving back the the United States from living abroad he could not understand why his fellow Americans would bully him.  In the long run it forged him into what he needed inside to become a Navy SEAL.  Justins talks in great detail about his experience fighting  on the front lines of Mosul, Iraq. After leaving the SEAL Teams Justin has pursued becoming an artist, a hidden talent he recently discovered. Some say he is a modern day Leonardo Da Vinci.<br /><br />Justin Hughes Links:<br />Website:     <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.justinhughesart.com/">https://www.justinhughesart.com/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/justin_hughes_art/">https://www.instagram.com/justin_hughes_art/</a><br /><br />Please leave us a review on Apple Podcasts:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/shawn-ryan-show/id1492492083">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/shawn-ryan-show/id1492492083</a><br /><br />#VIGILANCEELITE #SHAWNRYANSHOW<br />Vigilance Elite/Shawn Ryan Links:<br />Website     - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.vigilanceelite.com">https://www.vigilanceelite.com</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shawnryan762">https://www.instagram.com/shawnryan762</a><br />Patreon     - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/VigilanceElite">https://www.patreon.com/VigilanceElite</a>{% endraw %}
