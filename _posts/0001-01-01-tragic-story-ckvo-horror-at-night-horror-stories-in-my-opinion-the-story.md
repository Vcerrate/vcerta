{% raw %}In my opinion, the story is tragic, however now not in relation to the foremost character.<br />Three younger humans (two of them are newlyweds, and the 1/3 is their new American buddy ) stroll alongside the partitions of the fortress. An American for enjoyable throws a stone from the fortress wall and kills a kitten that was once enjoying on the grass close to its mom ( it all came about as if by way of accident, however any sane individual would have foreseen this outcome, throwing a stone from a top in the course of a frolicking youngster). In General, the kitten dies in the front of the mom cat, who is mad with rage and starts offevolved to pursue the killer of her child. The American compares her to an Indian Squaw, whose son used to be killed earlier than her eyes, and who for countless years tracked down the assassin of her toddler and then lengthy and painfully killed him. At the equal time, the American is the &quot;happy&quot; proprietor of a pockets made of the pores and skin of the sufferer of the Indian lady ( which in my opinion, characterizes the major persona as nicely as viable ). In General, my sympathies in the direction of the story have been now not on his side, however on the facet of the bad cat, who used to be decided to take revenge on him.<br />If now not for the final sentence in the story, the alignment would, in my opinion, be definitely fair.<br />Don't damage the animals.Horror stories.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100004631804795">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100004631804795</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPzSnP43n4cACWwOurkhXYA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPzSnP43n4cACWwOurkhXYA</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/irina_kotlenk">https://www.instagram.com/irina_kotlenk</a>{% endraw %}
