{% raw %}I Am Athlete Podcast Breakup Exposed Pt. 2  - The Real Reason  | Clip From Nicky And Moose The Podcast Episode 72<br /><br />Fred Taylor And Channing Crowder from The Pivot Podcast finally open up about the real reason why they left the I Am Athlete Podcast. Nicky and Moose give their take on it as well as discuss other Podcast Models like Wallo &amp; Gillies' Million Dollaz Worth Of Game. What can personal brands learn from this break up?<br /><br />Shownotes: www.nickyandmoose.com/72<br /><br />More About The Pivot:<br />The Pivot Podcast hosted by former NFL Stars Channing Crowder, Fred Taylor &amp; Ryan Clark.<br /><br />More About I Am Athlete:<br />I Am Athlete podcast is a candid, unscripted weekly discussion between Brandon Marshall and former NFL greats. These gridiron giants pull no punches and have no filter while expressing themselves on the importance of the issues and topics they cover. I AM ATHLETE is a thought-provoking and in-depth podcast that offers multiple perspectives on subjects ranging from sports to controversial topics to fashion to lifestyle covering all cultural conversations and building a platform to educate but encourage viewers to engage.<br /><br />More About Million Dollaz Worth Of Game Podcast:<br />Million Dollaz Worth of Game, a weekly podcast hosted by legendary Philadelphia rapper/actor Gillie Da King and social media influencer and disruptor Wallo, sounds nothing like any traditional podcast available. Forget the manufactured New York or LA personalities, or the former athlete who doesnâ€™t know what life is really like, this show is a refreshing conversation about what itâ€™s really like growing up in the streets of Philadelphia, and how the values Gillie and Wallo learned apply to everyone.<br /><br />The entire focus of the show is to teach you how to have GAME, which is authenticity, empathy, and truth to yourself, while injecting humor into every aspect of conversation. GAME is more of a life story than an expression to Gillie and Wallo, who took different paths to wind up hosting a show that would change so many peopleâ€™s lives.<br /><br /><br />Subscribe for more content from Nicky And Moose: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/NickyAndMooseYTSub">https://bit.ly/NickyAndMooseYTSub</a><br /><br />The Podcast ðŸŽ§  &amp; More: www.nickyandmoose.com/<br /><br />This Podcast was created using Ecamm Live.
