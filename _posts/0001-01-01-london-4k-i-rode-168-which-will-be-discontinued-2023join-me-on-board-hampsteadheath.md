{% raw %}#hampsteadheath #camdentown #waterloo #elephantandcastle There's a lot to see on a trip to London, and especially on your first trip to the city. Taking a bus is one of the easiest ways to get a good view of London without much hassle or expense; all you have to do is find out which route you want to take and then leave the driving to them while you gawk at the scene. London is covered by more than 700 bus routes, and many travel past some of the city's iconic sights. As a bonus, many of the buses are double-deckers, and what a great view you'll get on the upper deck. <br />London buses no longer accept cash fares, so you will need an Oyster card loaded with sufficient credit or a travelcard. You could also consider using a contactless payment card to pay for London transport.<br />If you are short on time and want to guarantee that you see all of the big sights in London, your best bet is the classic Big Bus Tours circular route. Today I am please to introduce you with routes 168 , what a great opportunity, please don't miss it out and watch till the end. There is the bus stops in case you need it, please have a look and find out where you exactly are located. You can tap on exact time and with doing that you will transfer to that particular moment.<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:40 Royal Free Hospital (D)<br />02:48 Haverstock Hill / Pond Street (F)<br />04:17 Belsize Park Station (L)<br />05:03 Downside Crescent (M)<br />05:31 Upper Park Road (N)<br />06:24 Haverstock Hill / Steele's Village (P)<br />07:56 Chalk Farm Station (CD)<br />10:44 Chalk Farm Road / Morrisons (CE)<br />12:55 Hawley Road (M)<br />14:40 Camden Gardens (D)<br />15:30 Camden Town Station / Camden Street (R)<br />16:37 Camden Town Station / Bayham Street (T)<br />17:36 Pratt Street (W)<br />19:55 Mornington Cres Stn / Camden Tn Library (G)<br />21:38 Aldenham Street (S)<br />22:52 Euston Station (B)<br />24:34 Upper Woburn Place (M)<br />25:38 Tavistock Square (N)<br />26:29 Russell Square (J)<br />28:05 Southampton Row (B)<br />29:28 Southampton Row / Theobald's Road (X)<br />Kingsway / Holborn Station (M)<br />Aldwych / Drury Lane (S)<br />Waterloo Bridge / South Bank (N)<br />45:17 Waterloo Station / Waterloo Road (D)<br />46:20 The Old Vic (S)<br />47:16 St George's Circus (T)<br />49:48 Elephant &amp; Castle / London Road (E)<br />Elephant &amp; Castle / New Kent Road (J)<br />52:09 Rodney Place (BA)<br />53:30 Bricklayer's Arms / New Kent Road (BB)<br />56:38 Bricklayer's Arms (BK)<br />57:27 Old Kent Road / East Street (G)<br />59:00 Dunton Road (EC)<br />Date filmed: Monday 2 May 2022<br />Filming location: London Bus Route 168 Hampstead Heath to Old Kent Road<br />Camera 1 Go Pro Hero 9 Black <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero9-black/CHDHX-901-master.html">https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero9-black/CHDHX-901-master.html</a><br />Camera 2 Go Pro Hero 8 Black <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero8-black/CHDHX-801-master.html">https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero8-black/CHDHX-801-master.html</a><br />Pictures I Phone 12 Pro <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2020/11/iphone-12-pro-max-iphone-12-mini-and-homepod-mini-available-to-order-friday/">https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2020/11/iphone-12-pro-max-iphone-12-mini-and-homepod-mini-available-to-order-friday/</a><br />You Tube Thumbnail via Canva<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.canva.com/q/pro/?utm_source=google_sem&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=REV_UK_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier1_Core_EM&amp;utm_term=REV_UK_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier1_Canva_EM&amp;utm_content=078_control&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAqvaNBhDLARIsAH1Pq50WSYKduJLuVIEgvOfdAkca1c4fJY_Vdd1q4nYSPxQdI4Y5L6ekzcsaAqSiEALw_wcB">https://www.canva.com/q/pro/?utm_source=google_sem&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=REV_UK_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier1_Core_EM&amp;utm_term=REV_UK_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier1_Canva_EM&amp;utm_content=078_control&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAqvaNBhDLARIsAH1Pq50WSYKduJLuVIEgvOfdAkca1c4fJY_Vdd1q4nYSPxQdI4Y5L6ekzcsaAqSiEALw_wcB</a><br />Editing Software program Davinci Resolve 17.4 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAqvaNBhDLARIsAH1Pq53AqakalPwhl_GUpmBlOeSfeN0w6_GTIjixvupwrZpW1LJQyNnm3IgaAiyDEALw_wcB">https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAqvaNBhDLARIsAH1Pq53AqakalPwhl_GUpmBlOeSfeN0w6_GTIjixvupwrZpW1LJQyNnm3IgaAiyDEALw_wcB</a><br />Lap Top ASUS ZEN BOOK<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.asus.com/uk/Laptops/For-Home/ZenBook/ZenBook-Pro-Duo-UX581/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAqvaNBhDLARIsAH1Pq53zUguBZjdmlBEGgtZsv5taR-48GggmNkoVXy0i_95HRqfF8rUyRu8aAuoXEALw_wcB">https://www.asus.com/uk/Laptops/For-Home/ZenBook/ZenBook-Pro-Duo-UX581/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAqvaNBhDLARIsAH1Pq53zUguBZjdmlBEGgtZsv5taR-48GggmNkoVXy0i_95HRqfF8rUyRu8aAuoXEALw_wcB</a><br />Bus Route <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://moovitapp.com/london_and_south_east-2122/lines/168/578326/2257716/en-gb?customerId=4908&amp;ref=2&amp;poiType=line">https://moovitapp.com/london_and_south_east-2122/lines/168/578326/2257716/en-gb?customerId=4908&amp;ref=2&amp;poiType=line</a><br />Route length:  7 miles(11km)<br />Hope you enjoyed this bus ride, for more like it join me next time!<br />If you wish to Support me by leaving a small tip or buying me a ticket, please<br />Buy Me a ticket on Ko-Fi: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/londonbusrider">https://ko-fi.com/londonbusrider</a><br />Thank you for supporting me this way!<br />Subscribe,üíóand share <br />YouTube:@ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/londonbusrider">https://www.youtube.com/c/londonbusrider</a> <br />Please do not copy,reproduce or distribute any content without my permission.
