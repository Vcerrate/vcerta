{% raw %}Curing Meat With Salt | Preserving Meat With Salt At Home<br /><br />One of my all-time favorite foods has been cured meat🍖.<br />Chewy and salty, fatty and aromatic, cured meat is super delicious and versatile.<br /><br />BUT the way I enjoyed it best is in switches🥪 or as a flavor enhancer for stews🍲 and rice dishes, and until recently the only way I've enjoyed it was as a product that I bought from the shop.<br /><br />Honestly, this didn't sit too well with me and my desire to become more sustainable and self-reliant because I was still dependent on the store to get my cured meat fix 🤔.<br /><br />As a child, I was blessed to spend most of my summer and winter holidays in the countryside with my grandparents 👵👴  and I knew that you can preserve most of your summer crops for winter and cure most of your meat harvest as well in different ways; I even knew how just never came to me that I can actually do it myself🙄🙄... <br /><br />Not sure why now (maybe another lockdown) but it was time for me to get those memories on paper and try to cure my own piece of meat - which I did.<br /><br />In this video, I document the time and process that it took to cure a decent piece of pork loin with salt, spices and cold dry it in the fridge until it became an amazing, and safe to eat specialty food item.<br /><br />Enjoy and share with us your experience in the comments.<br /><br />If you would like to Support me, you can do so through the links below.<br />Thank you<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=FKY6HBBYG8944">https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=FKY6HBBYG8944</a><br />or<br />paypal.me/HomevertHomesteader<br /><br />Get in Touch:<br /><br />PO BOX<br />Homevert Homesteader<br />Skrytka Pocztowa 74<br />82-300 Elblag<br />Poland<br /><br />Want printable posters?
