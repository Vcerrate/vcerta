{% raw %}Days To Recollect by Thomas Hardy<br /><br />Do you recall<br />That day in Fall<br />When we walked towards Saint Alban’s Head,<br />On thistledown that summer had shed,<br />Or must I remind you?<br />Winged thistle-seeds which hitherto<br />Had lain as none were there, or few,<br />But rose at the brush of your petticoat-seam<br />(As ghosts might rise of the recent dead),<br />And sailed on the breeze in a nebulous stream<br />Like a comet’s tail behind you:<br />You don’t recall<br />That day in Fall?<br /><br />Then do you remember<br />That sad November<br />When you left me never to see me more,<br />And looked quite other than theretofore,<br />As if it could not be you?<br />And lay by the window whence you had gazed<br />So many times when blamed or praised,<br />Morning or noon, through years and years,<br />Accepting the gifts that Fortune bore,<br />Sharing, enduring, joys, hopes, fears!<br />Well: I never more did see you. –<br />Say you remember<br />That sad November!<br /><br />#ThomasHardy #DaysToRecollect #Poems #Poetry{% endraw %}
