You Won! Throughout the late 90s and 2000s, millions of people around the world found themselves presented with these ads, telling them that they were the 1,000,000th visitor to a website and that they won a grand prize. However, there was never a prize, and people continued falling for this scam and still fall for it today. How? What is the story behind the Millionth Visitor? <br /><br />There was probably a time in your life where you felt really special, where you felt like just the luckiest person in the entire world. What were the odds that this would happen to you? In that moment in time, you were exactly where you needed to be. But then the more cynical part of you starts creeping at the back of your mind. “If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.” Maybe you aren’t actually the 1,000,000th visitor, and perhaps you should get out before its too late. The rapid growth of the internet in the 2000s naturally led to the growth of internet scams, which was facilitated even further by the continuous advancement of online technology. And just like that, people across the world visiting a variety of websites, were getting this same message, from this same voice, telling them they were the website’s 1,000,000th visitor, and to “click here” to claim their price. Congratulations! You Won! But as we all know, there was never a prize on the other size. Just an open invitation to downloading tons of malware to your computer. It seems like such a painstakingly obvious scam when looking at it at face value, yet so many people fell for it and continue to fall for it even today. How? This is one of the few pieces of malware that you could safely say is universally recognized. Everyone has come across it or seen it at least once in some way, shape or form. But what are the pop-up’s origins, who created it, and why?<br /><br />Viewer discretion is advised.<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nationsquid.com/">http://www.nationsquid.com/</a><br /><br />Merchandise: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/squids-secret">https://teespring.com/stores/squids-secret</a><br /><br />Google +: just kidding.<br /><br />Wholesome by Kevin MacLeod<br />Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5050-wholesome">https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5050-wholesome</a><br />License: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://filmmusic.io/standard-license">https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</a><br /><br />ENJOY THE PROGRAM.{% endraw %}
