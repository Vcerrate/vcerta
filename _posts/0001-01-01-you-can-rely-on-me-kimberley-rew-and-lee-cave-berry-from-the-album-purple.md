{% raw %}You Can Rely On Me gallops past, powered by puissant percussion. Kim explains – “For me, the best band performance captured on film is Santana at Woodstock. I really wanted to bottle the spirit of those urgent tom toms.” <br />This video, compiled by the talented Paul Foulsham of Cloud5Creative, uses public domain footage.{% endraw %}
