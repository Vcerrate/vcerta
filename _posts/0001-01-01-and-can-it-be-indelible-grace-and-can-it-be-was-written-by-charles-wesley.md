{% raw %}And Can It Be was written by Charles Wesley, and first published in 1738. Charles and his brother, John Wesley, played a significant role of the development of Christianity in both England and the American colonies, and the establishment of the Methodist movement. John Wesley's influence was felt through his leadership and preaching while Charles influenced many more people through his songs. <br /><br /><br /><br />Charles Wesley wrote over 5500 hymns, which include Christ the Lord is Risen Today, Hark the Herald Angels Sing, and O For a Thousand Tongues to Sing, and many other hymns that have served Christians for centuries.<br /><br /><br /><br />This hymn describes the wonder that fills our hearts when we consider the mercy that caused God to take on flesh and die in our place.<br /><br /><br /><br />This melody for this version was reworked by Scott Roley.
