{% raw %}Visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://l.awmi.net/What-Is-Truth">https://l.awmi.net/What-Is-Truth</a> to order this teaching. <br /><br />Truth as an ideal has become meaningless to people of the world. As long as what they hear makes them feel good and confirms their beliefs, it doesn’t matter if it is totally wrong. Christians can fall into the same trap, picking and choosing what parts of the Bible they take as true. But God’s Word is truth. <br /> <br />Andrew Wommack’s new teaching, What Is Truth?, cuts through the countless lies the world throws at us and reinforces how the Bible is true in all circumstances. Everything that is going on in our lives and in society as a whole comes down to a fight between what is true and what is not. God’s truth is attacked by selfish deception. In our struggle against deceit, we need to turn to the Bible—God’s revealed truth to us. <br /> <br />The Bible is not a book written by men about God. It is God’s direct communication to man, through inspired authors. It is a supernatural book upon which you can base your life. We need to believe in it entirely, not simply choosing the parts that are convenient. When we do so, we live in victory.  <br /> <br />Build a solid foundation for your faith as you understand the truth of the Bible and learn to evaluate what you are hearing through the filter of the Word. <br /> <br />What is Truth? is available as a CD or DVD. You can also get it as part of a package including the Biblical Worldview: Foundational Truths series.  <br /> <br />Products available: <br />• What Is Truth?
