{% raw %}Hey everyone!  Finally, after 19 months I finished this massive video.  I had no idea it would be over 5 hours long, so I suggest treating it like a &quot;video book&quot; in a way.  Feel free to download it and do whatever you want with it.<br /><br />0:00 - Introduction<br />7:19 - About this video<br />17:23 - About improvisation<br />29:09 - How Allan thinks of scales and harmony<br />1:05:26 - Common Allan themes<br /><br />1:16:00 - Major tonality lines<br />1:20:55 - Minor tonality lines<br /><br />Major Scale:<br />1:26:00 - Ionian<br />1:34:16 - Dorian<br />1:42:49 - Phrygian<br />1:49:45 - Lydian<br />1:53:58 - Mixolydian<br />2:02:31 - Aeolian<br />2:09:01 - Locrain<br /><br />2:11:59 - Multipositional lines<br /><br />2:13:51 - Octave phrases<br /><br />2:15:12 - Pentatonic<br /><br />2:29:38 - Melodic Minor<br /><br />2:38:49 - Diminished scale<br /><br />2:57:19 - Add b6 scale<br /><br />3:09:38 - Add b6 / Harmonic Major / Harmonic Minor similarities<br /><br />3:14:26 - Harmonic Minor<br /><br />3:18:15 - Harmonic Major<br /><br />Messaien 3rd Mode:<br />3:20:03 - Messiaen's 3rd mode<br />3:29:38 - Allan's scale symbols<br />3:34:47 - Whole Tone<br />3:36:35 - Augmented scale<br /><br />3:38:06 - Outside playing<br /><br />4:29:22 - Tapping<br /><br />Synthaxe:<br />4:32:30 - About the Synthaxe and tunings<br />4:44:09 - 5ths<br />4:56:09 - 4ths <br />4:58:19 - Octave displacement<br />5:11:35 - Sequenced Solos<br /><br />5:18:14 - Ending<br /><br />If I sound a bit weird in it I apologize, it took me 11 hours to record all in<br />one day.<br /><br />This was a culmination of transcribing lines from almost 40 years of Allan <br />Holdsworth solos and what I learned from it.  The idea on making this video was to make YOU more comfortable with your own playing, and perhaps take some ideas and make them your own.<br /><br />The video has 946 examples, but that's just about a third of what I transcribed.<br /><br />In the end it turned out to be 34 files, 189 solos, 629 pages, 6,804 measures and 2,302 lines.<br /> <br />If you would like to purchase all the trancriptions I did, you can follow this<br />link.  You can also buy my book there as well as a combo if you don't already own it for a little extra.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://holdsworthpdfs.e-junkie.com/">https://holdsworthpdfs.e-junkie.com/</a><br /><br />PLEASE NOTE these are not FULL transcriptions of the solos!  Its just as many fast lines as I could, so some tunes are almost fully transcribed, while others not as much.  Also the rhythms are not 100% accurate either.  I wouldn't want anyone to purchase it and feel cheated.<br /><br />Thank you so much for all the kind words and support you've all given me.  Doing this is the best thank you I can give for Allan to help people understand his music better and also make people better players.  This is my masterpiece of teaching in a way with everything i've learned myself in 25 years of playing.<br /><br />Thank you!!!{% endraw %}
