{% raw %}Here is the start to a series where I try to find great deals on airplanes for you. I'm not brokering the airplanes, simply trying to point out what I believe to be good deals in the market.<br /><br />Here is a beautiful Cessna 177 Cardinal for sale listed today on a Facebook Buy, Sell page. The Cardinal is the first step toward higher performance 4 seat Cessna aircraft. Compared to the 172 it has a much more laid back windscreen, and eliminate the wing support struts. There are retractable gear models available as well, this however remains fixed gear. With the same approximate power as a 172 you can expect to gain a few extra knots of cruise speed.<br /><br />All in all, this seems like a beauty of a deal.<br /><br />#mytimetofly #generalaviation #cessna{% endraw %}
