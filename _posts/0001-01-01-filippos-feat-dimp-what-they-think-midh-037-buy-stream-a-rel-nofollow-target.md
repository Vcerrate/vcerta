The label has been putting on parties for a decade across Europe and Africa. MIDH are known for their deep house vibrations, merged with afro beat flavors, echoed in their relentless quality release schedule.<br /><br />Next up on MIDH is a split EP with a duo of talent for twice the dancefloor pleasure. German DJ and producer Re.You, joins forces with Thessaloniki rising star Filippos on the ‘ Zange / What They Think ‘ EP.<br />Re.You has been around the underground electronic scene for a while: Real name Marius Maier, he has transcended trends and hype to forge his own musical pathway in the scene. Catching the ears of Keinemusik a decade ago, he formed a live act with label head Rampa. Other releases have been on Gigolo, Cocoon, Rebirth, Anja Schneider's Mobilee, and the hallowed Kompakt. He has remixed for M.A.N.D.Y. Ninetoes and Butch, reworking for the Stereo’s Mc’s, and even Lana Del Rey! Running his own labels Younion and LSF21+ with Sante, this prolific producer continues his quest for the ultimate rhythmic vibrations.<br /><br />Thessaloniki native and young star Filippos, cut his teeth amidst the nightlife of his hometown, making a name for himself in Greece, at the same climbing the Beatport afro house charts with his ‘Kairetu’ that sat at number one for a good while. Earlier introduced onto the MIDH Records roster, with ‘Simera’, his collaboration with South Africa’s Black Soda, he has also played the main stage of Greece’s largest electronic festival ‘Reworks’. This young and firey producer strives hard for production perfection, making him one to watch on the international scene as well as the Aegean horizon. <br /><br />This two-track EP is a short collection of two big and heady club grooves that span rolling deep house beats, to the more hypnotic and minimal. The opener ‘Zange’ is mesmerizing, with a sparse but powerful beat, while the march drums of ‘What They Think’ summon up an army of a thousand club starved ravers, who want nothing more than to stomp the night away under the balmy Grecian night sky.{% endraw %}
