{% raw %}Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Wesley Clark told DW that he was &quot;surprised by the ineffectiveness of the Russian military&quot; in Ukraine. &quot;The Russians have proven themselves a relatively inept force,&quot; he said. Clarke said &quot;any negotiations will be determined by the outcome on the ground, [which] is determined by the resistance of the Ukrainians&quot; and that NATO should increase its support to Ukraine by giving it &quot;javelins, stingers and as much anti-air and air support as is feasible to do.&quot; Clark added that although it wasn't possible to establish a &quot;legalistic&quot; no-fly zone in Ukraine, &quot;air support can be provided by nations who are willing to go in.&quot;<br /><br />When asked if NATO air support could lead to further escalation and the outbreak of a third world war, Clark said &quot;if we fall back and are intimidated by Mr. Putin's threat of nuclear weapons, if there's nothing we can do to help Ukraine, then we'll be dealing with the next crisis on NATO's territory itself.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Escalation by Mr. Putin is not solely under the control of NATO,&quot; Clarke said, adding that Putin may decide to escalate regardless of NATO's actions. Clarke said that, although Russian forces were currently &quot;checked&quot; on the ground by Ukraine, this could change quickly as Russia ramps up bombing and shelling of population centers. Putin is &quot;trying to steal Ukraine as quietly and quickly as he can,&quot; Clark said. &quot;But he will use massive firepower if necessary.&quot;<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />For more news go to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dw.com/en/">http://www.dw.com/en/</a><br />Follow DW on social media:<br />►Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/">https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/</a><br />►Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/dwnews">https://twitter.com/dwnews</a><br />►Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dwnews">https://www.instagram.com/dwnews</a><br />Für Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch">https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch</a><br />#Russia #Urkaine #WesleyClark{% endraw %}
