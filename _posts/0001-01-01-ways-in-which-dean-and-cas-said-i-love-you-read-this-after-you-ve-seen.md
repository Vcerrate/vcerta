{% raw %}READ THIS AFTER YOU'VE SEEN THE VIDEO (or before. Whatever. It's your life. I won't tell you how to live it)<br /><br />Dean and Cas' relationship begins and ends with saying nothing<br /><br />First Chorus - Hunter/Angel<br />&quot;..lets me know that you need me&quot; -  Cas to Dean<br />&quot;..you'll never leave me&quot; - Dean to Cas<br />&quot;..catch me wherever I fall&quot; - Dean to Cas<br /><br />&quot;You say it best when you say nothing at all&quot; - I love you<br /><br />Second Chorus - 2014 (Fallen!Cas)<br />&quot;..lets me know that you need me&quot; -  Dean to Cas<br />&quot;..you'll never leave me&quot; - Dean to Cas<br />&quot;..catch me wherever I fall&quot; - Cas to Dean<br /><br />&quot;You say it best when you say nothing at all&quot; - I'll always love you<br /><br />Last Chorus - Godstiel<br />&quot;..lets me know that you need me&quot; -  both<br />&quot;..you'll never leave me&quot; - Cas to Dean<br />&quot;..catch me wherever I fall&quot; - Dean to Cas<br /><br />&quot;You say it best when you say nothing at all&quot;<br />Dean walks away - &quot;We're done. I'm giving up on you&quot;<br />Cas with his sad eyes - &quot;Don't leave me&quot;<br /><br />Basically, what I'm getting at is that the foundation of Dean and Cas' relationship is when they speak without words and express all their deep, penetrating feelings for each other with just a look (and you know, saving each other and stuff)<br /><br />This was supposed to be just a really schmoopy video with extra cheese, but I couldn't help myself so I sprinkled a pinch of angst. Because I'm emo like that.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://mishasminions.tumblr.com/post/9797409630">http://mishasminions.tumblr.com/post/9797409630</a>{% endraw %}
