{% raw %}In this episode of Ridin' Horses, Kerry shows how he likes to use the trot to roll up into the canter and how it benefits the horse by encouraging him to send his energy forward and not up.  (Please disregard Kerry's mistake in explaining which diagonal is which, he does know which diagonal to post on, he just mixed them up while he was talking){% endraw %}
