{% raw %}Recastled CEO Kosha Gada says activism is showing up in many different forms, and there’s a lot of pressure for corporations to heed to it.  <br /><br />“The one counter dynamic I think that could possibly serve as a correction, we’ll see, is the consumer,” she told Sky News host Chris Kenny.  <br /><br />“I would not underestimate the pain that the consumer feels right now with gas prices, you know, up at $6-7 a gallon or higher. <br /><br />“That is the reality and I think when the wrath of those consumers that are hurting everyday sort of bubbles up to the surface, it may serve as a correcting factor.”{% endraw %}
