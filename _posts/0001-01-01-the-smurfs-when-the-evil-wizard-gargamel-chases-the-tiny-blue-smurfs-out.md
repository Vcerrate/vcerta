{% raw %}When the evil wizard Gargamel chases the tiny blue Smurfs out of their village, they tumble from their magical world and into ours -- in fact, smack dab in the middle of Central Park. Just three apples high and stuck in the Big Apple, the Smurfs must find a way to get back to their village before Gargamel tracks them down. MPAA Rating: PG Rated PG for some mild rude humor and action. 2011 Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. and Hemisphere - Culver Picture Partners I, LLC. All Rights Reserved.{% endraw %}
