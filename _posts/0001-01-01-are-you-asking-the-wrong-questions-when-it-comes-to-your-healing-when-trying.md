{% raw %}When trying to heal mental, emotional, and physical issues and illness, you might be asking questions from your faulty mental programs, which only keeps yourself stuck in sickness and lack.<br /><br /><br /><br />If you find yourself asking questions like “Will this approach work for me? What if everything else has failed? How do I heal my very specific life scenario?” None of these questions sets you free; they just keep you on a hamster wheel of ‘seeking.’<br /><br /><br /><br />Watch this week’s episode of MindBody TV where I shared the most commonly asked questions and what you COULD be asking instead to open up your clarity, abundance and health!<br /><br /><br /><br />P.S: To join the Embracing Health Program visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drkimd.com/health">https://drkimd.com/health</a> (We start June 9th!!)<br /><br />And you can find my book The Mindbody Toolkit at https:/drkimd.com/book<br /><br />*******<br /><br />Find Your Cure!
