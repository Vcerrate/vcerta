{% raw %}In this video from FRM Part 1 &amp; CFA Level 1 curriculum, we explore an alternative version of the Put Call parity which is called the Put Call Forward parity - a no-arbitrage relationship between European option prices (of same strike and maturity), forward / futures price and present value of strike. We recap the simple Put Call parity for the case of an underlying asset that doesn't pay any income and then transition our way to the Put Call Forward parity.
