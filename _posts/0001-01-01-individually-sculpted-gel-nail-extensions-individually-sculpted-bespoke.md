{% raw %}Individually sculpted, bespoke gel nail extensions in the making, by Monica, Figaro London's nail professional.<br /><br />Professionally sculptured nail extension sets are completely bespoke, they fit your nails perfectly and are super comfortable to wear. It is a meticulously precise work that can only be done exceptionally by a real professional.<br /><br />A form is customized to the required shape, which is then fitted just beneath the edge. A layer of gel is added and sculpted on it. Length can be customised according to your request, followed by the application of colour and/or decoration.<br /><br />Your nail plate is freed from any pressure with this method as the enhancement molds itself to the natural shape of your nail, instead of pulling at your nail plate to get it to conform to the contour of a tip.  This results in a safer, more comfortable and natural feeling enhancement. And that in itself we feel is worth the time and effort.  A one-colour set takes only an hour to create.<br /><br />That’s why we’d always go with sculpted, bespoke sets of extensions, and that’s what we here at Figaro London want to promote exclusively.<br /><br />Look after your nails, they are accessories you wear every single day.<br /><br />To read more and to book an appointment with Monica, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.figarolondon.uk/tips-or-no-tips-that-is-the-question/">https://www.figarolondon.uk/tips-or-no-tips-that-is-the-question/</a><br /><br />Music credit:<br /><br />Lights by Sappheiros <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/sappheirosmusic">https://soundcloud.com/sappheirosmusic</a><br />Creative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported  — CC BY 3.0 <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...</a><br />Music promoted by Audio Library <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/-lbbHQbZNKg">https://youtu.be/-lbbHQbZNKg</a><br /><br />–––<br /><br />• Contact the artist:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sappheiros">https://www.patreon.com/sappheiros</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxLK...">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxLK...</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SappheirosMusic">https://www.facebook.com/SappheirosMusic</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SappheirosMusic">https://twitter.com/SappheirosMusic</a>{% endraw %}
