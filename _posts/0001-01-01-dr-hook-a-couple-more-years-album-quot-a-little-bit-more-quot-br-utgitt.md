Their music spanned several genres, mostly novelty songs and acoustic ballads in their early years, though their greatest success came with their later material, mostly consisting of disco-influenced soft rock, which the band recorded under the shortened name Dr. Hook.<br />#DrHook  #ACoupleMoreYears #Pop #Rock #RonjasCountryMusic  #70s  #70sMusic #RonjasDrHookChannel #SoftRock{% endraw %}
