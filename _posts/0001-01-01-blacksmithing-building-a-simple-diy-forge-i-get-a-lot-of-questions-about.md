{% raw %}I get a lot of questions about how to start blacksmithing, how to get  tools and equipment etc. I wanted to make this video to show people that are interested in trying this craft, that you don't have to weld or fabricate a simple forge. It's much easier than that! My video is not a tutorial, instead I hope it can spark interest and contribute to some inspiration.<br /><br />Check out my recommended tools/gear section:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/torbjornahman">https://www.amazon.com/shop/torbjornahman</a><br /><br />If you like my videos you can support me at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/torbjornahman">https://www.patreon.com/torbjornahman</a><br /><br />.. or buy a T-Shirt here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.torbjornahman.se/tshirts">http://www.torbjornahman.se/tshirts</a>{% endraw %}
