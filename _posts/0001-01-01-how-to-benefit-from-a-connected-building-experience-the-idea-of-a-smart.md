{% raw %}Experience the idea of a smart building: We equipped an office building with sensors that collect all sorts of information. This information is being collected and visualized in the cloud-based Connected Building Platform almost in real-time. As a result, the building equipment and the office environment can be monitored, the availability of office desks can be checked and the movement of people via heat maps can be tracked. <br /><br />Further information:<br />Bosch Connected World Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://blog.bosch-si.com">http://blog.bosch-si.com</a> <br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bosch-io">https://www.linkedin.com/company/bosch-io</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/bosch_IO">https://twitter.com/bosch_IO</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bosch.io">https://www.bosch.io</a>{% endraw %}
