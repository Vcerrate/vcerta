In some regions of the world, loitering itself is not legal and can result in fines, jail time, and other punishments. Engaging in this activity in other areas may be punishable only when it is linked with illegal activity. Historically, anti-loitering laws were very common, but thanks to legal challenges, they have become less widespread and less frequently enforced.{% endraw %}
