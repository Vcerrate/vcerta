{% raw %}Two Missing Teens: Mark Seelman (16) and Douglas Goodwin (18) were last seen at DJ's Bar in the 6400 block of Martin Street in Rome, New York at approximately 12:05 a.m. on June 7, 1990. <br /><br />The 2 teens had spent the evening drinking and may have been intoxicated when they left.<br /><br />Eye witness accounts from that night claim that Seelman and Goodwin may have been seen getting into a green vehicle, reportedly a late 1970s Chevrolet Malibu or Nova, with an unidentified African American male.<br /><br />Investigators speculate they may have been en route to Utica, New York that night, and that the two teens left on their own accord.<br /><br />Neither of the boys has been heard from again.<br /><br />This documentary brings you alongside Adventures With Purpose's underwater search in Rome, NY, following clues as to the teens' last known location that evening, leading us to search a nearby river where 2 vehicles were found, one being a '60-'70s green car, and the other one an Oldsmobile Starfire resembling the same size and shape of a '70s Malibu. <br /><br />Did we find Mark and Douglas' final resting place?<br /><br />2-IN-1 WINDOW BREAKER SEAT BELT CUTTER (Might Save Your Life)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://adventureswithpurpose.com/products/2-in-1-emergency-window-breaker">https://adventureswithpurpose.com/products/2-in-1-emergency-window-breaker</a><br /><br />HOW CAN YOU HELP?<br />========<br />‚û¶ Share this video and SPREAD AWARENESS of the service AWP provides for FREE!<br /><br />Because of your support, We Don't Charge Families for our time to serve in helping them locate their lost loved ones, so please, SHARE this video and awareness about AWP so that other families in need can find us.<br /><br />üéØ Subscribe to AWP on YouTube (It's Free)...‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubAWP">http://bit.ly/SubAWP</a><br />üëï AWP Merch and Donations..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://adventureswithpurpose.com">https://adventureswithpurpose.com</a><br />üé¨ BECOME A MEMBER (Get Videos Early)... ‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/AWP-Team-Member">http://bit.ly/AWP-Team-Member</a><br />‚úÖ Follow Us on Facebook... ‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/FollowAWP">https://bit.ly/FollowAWP</a><br /><br />HOW IS AWP FUNDED?... ‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wz1dCguO2y0">https://youtu.be/wz1dCguO2y0</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO OTHERS ON THE TEAM<br />‚òû Subscribe to Doug..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/DougBishop">http://bit.ly/DougBishop</a><br />‚òû Sub to Josh..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/SubJoshCantu">https://bit.ly/SubJoshCantu</a><br />‚òû Carson on Instagram..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/CarsonOnInstagram">https://bit.ly/CarsonOnInstagram</a><br />‚òû Sub to Profiling Evil..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/SubProfilingEvil">https://bit.ly/SubProfilingEvil</a><br /><br />Josh‚Äôs Behind-the-Scenes<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2bSHhBKPXI0">https://youtu.be/2bSHhBKPXI0</a><br /><br />Questions or Want to Tell Us About a Case?<br />Email: support@adventureswithpurpose.com<br />========<br /><br />CASE NOTES<br />================<br />Mark's loved ones believe he did not run away and foul play was involved in his disappearance. He left behind all his clothes, his money, his cigarettes, and his new shoes, and it's uncharacteristic of him to leave without warning. He wasn't reported missing for several days, because his family thought he was with friends.<br /><br />Someone using Mark's name and Social Security number was located in Missouri in 2001, but police determined this individual was not Mark and had in fact stolen his identity. There have been no leads in his case since then.<br /><br />Douglas Goodwin was living a transient lifestyle at the time of his disappearance. He left home due to problems with his parents and lived with his girlfriend and her mother in Utica for a few weeks, but shortly before his disappearance, they had an argument, and Goodwin was supposed to move out.<br /><br />He never collected his belongings and never contacted his girlfriend again. She was pregnant at the time of his disappearance and later gave birth to his son. According to his girlfriend, Goodwin had dropped out of high school and was enrolled in a graphic arts program with the Madison-Oneida Board of Cooperative Educational Services in 1990.<br /><br />It's unclear what happened to the two boys after leaving DJ's Bar that evening. <br /><br />We are humbled by the opportunity all of you have given us to help in searches like this one for answers as to what happened to Mark and Douglas.<br /><br />Hug the ones you love for you never know when it might be the last time you see them. <br /><br />As of the release of this documentary, because of your support: 19 Missing Person Cold Cases Have Been Solved since 2019, bringing resolution and answers to families looking for their lost loved ones.<br /><br />The AWP Movement would not be possible without your support as we document these cases, spreading awareness of our efforts, helping us travel the US offering our services for FREE to families, in search of their lost loved ones.<br /><br />Please Consider Donating to AWP and Help Further Our Efforts.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://adventureswithpurpose.com/products/make-a-donation">https://adventureswithpurpose.com/products/make-a-donation</a><br /><br />üé¨üçø Watch More of Our Missing Person Cold Case Recoveries<br /><br />SOLVED: Missing 23-years Underwater<br />(Samantha Hopper, 22-month-old Daughter Courtney, Unborn Baby)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/isqd8OOcJpQ">https://youtu.be/isqd8OOcJpQ</a><br /><br />SOLVED 84-Year-Old Missing Person Case..
