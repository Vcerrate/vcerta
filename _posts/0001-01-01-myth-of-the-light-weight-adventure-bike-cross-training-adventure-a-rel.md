{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.crosstrainingenduro.com">http://www.crosstrainingenduro.com</a> I've spent quite a few years trying out different bikes as a &quot;do-everything&quot; bike: a bike you can dirt ride AND adventure ride which i believe means bike under 150kg or 330lb dry. You inevitably face compromises, the trick is how much you want to compromise. This vid looks at my experimenting with the lightest enduro bikes and moving through to the solid reliable heavy plodders as a light adventure bike. <br /><br />Adventure Oz Youtube channel:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/secretgardenproject">https://www.youtube.com/user/secretgardenproject</a> <br />HUSABERG FE570 2009-2012 (possibly the FE450 if no 570s available) 115kg, 50+hp at rear wheel. If you think you'll enjoy dirt riding then these can match any 450 dirt bike in gnarly stuff, but have smooth power and heaps of grunt to cruise on the highway for hours if needed. Pity they don't make them any more. :(<br />BETA RR480 / RS500 112kg, 50+hp at rear wheel. My next project! The beta thumpers have been around for five years now and are proving to be bulletproof engines with great longevity and quite a few guys have been using these for dual sport or adventure riding. the RS500 version in the USA is especially proving popular as it can be road registered in those states that don't like dirt bikes. <br />YAMAHA WR450: 115kg, close to 50hp rear wheel. A high performance enduro bike that comes fairly close to low maintenance and longevity of the Husabergs.... five speed box is limiting though for a light weight adventure bike.<br />JAPANESE 250 DUAL SPORTS BIKES: surprisingly quite a few guys are adventurizing 250s, power in the high 20s weight around 125kg. very popular in the USA for some reason, a lot of guys adv ride the TTR250 and similar Jap bikes. <br />DRZ400 around 125kg, 34 hp rear wheel. A popular light adv bike, very cheap to buy new and heaps of aftermarket parts and nearly indestructable.<br />HUSQVARNA TE610 136kg, not sure on hp but getting close to 50 at the rear wheel i think. Very grunty engines, perfect if you short shift as they don't go any faster if you rev past 7000, just make more noise. Husky could have gone a long way toward the perfect light weight adventure bike with some tweaks on this one. <br />KTM 690R: 139 to 145kg depending on the year model, around 70hp (!!!) An interesting bike, I hated it and sold it within three months and noted that quite a few riders feel the same way about them. yet a friend of mine got his at the same time and after spending a few thousand dollars extra on it says its his near perfect light weight adventure bike.<br />DR650 about 147 kg dry, 34 hp at rear wheel, closer to 40 derestricted. very capable offroad compared to the KLR, still good on the highway. heaps of aftermarket gear. A favourite for me as a reasonably light weight adventure bike despite lots of niggling little issues. <br />HONDA XL650 we don't get this in australia, boohoo. but a great alternative to the DR650, about 7kg lighter, less known issues, only slightly more expensive.<br />TWO BIKE OPTION<br />Personally I've settled on this now myself, I found the compromise too much with one bike doing it all, although the FE570 was the closest I got to the ideal light weight adventure bike.<br />Good luck with the hunt! Welcome to Cross Training Adventure, we are into all things dual sport and adventure on the east coast of Australia... with occasional detours to places like Vietnam, Cambodia, Romania and Canada. This is one of our three channels, there's also a Cross Training Trials channel, and a Cross Training  Enduro channel. All three are equally dodgy. We are the 27th most watched dirt channel in Uzbekistan. We have won the polished turd award five years in a row. And we have a world record 25 class action lawsuits for inaccurate information.  We think the whole motorbike scene is getting too commercial. So called dual sport riding reviews are just glossy ads nowadays. Everyone is trying to sell you stuff you don't need, convince you to buy the latest model with anodized coffee cup holders for your trips to the coffee shop.  Of course if you are cashed up and into bling, go for it. All we are saying is there's also the budget option for adventure riding. And it won't hold you back. Why? We reckon it's 80% the rider and 20% the bike. So the Cross Training Adventure focus is just get out there and have fun on two wheels. Instead of obsessing over the latest blinged out Beemer, which tyres to fit or spending a fortune on your suspension or billet alloy gas cap. So most of our adventure ridingvids will feature the much loved bush pig, the Suzuki DR650. And we've done a 10 part series on how to unleash the mighty beast that lurks within.  <br /><br />Let us know if we used your music in other vids but forgot to credit you.
