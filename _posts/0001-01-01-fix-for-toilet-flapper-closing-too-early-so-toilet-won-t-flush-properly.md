{% raw %}My toilet wouldn't flush anymore unless I held down the handle. Initially I thought it was because the flapper chain had too much or too little slack but that wasn't my case. Further inspection revealed that the clip holding the float down was missing from the top of the float, causing the float to move up the chain as water filled the tank. For proper flapper operation,  the float must be about 1 inch above the flapper. My flapper wasn't leaking so I opted not to replace it with a new flapper. Instead I used a tie wrap to secure the float at the proper height and now the flapper stays open long enough for enough water to enter the bowl for a proper flush.{% endraw %}
