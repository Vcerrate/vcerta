{% raw %}I've tried uploading this at least ten times help me<br /><br />But at last, here are a few snippets and edits I made of TROS<br />There's so much wrong in this movie, I've never seen anything like it<br />This is the worst movie I've ever seen, but at the same time I love it lmao<br /><br />It's so absurdly and comically written and produced that you can't help but laugh at how dumb everything is and how it just put a nail in the coffin of one of the best movie sagas of all time<br /><br />That said, I made this video for fun, if you genuinely like this movie then that's great, good for you :){% endraw %}
