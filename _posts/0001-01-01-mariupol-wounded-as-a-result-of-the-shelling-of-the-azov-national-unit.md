{% raw %}A resident of Mariupol, Vladimir Ivanovich Marushin, talks about how he was wounded as a result of the shelling of the “Azov” national unit from the “Azovstal”:<br /><br />— ...the first victim – a mine flew into the house and killed a young guy, my neighbor. The house was blown to shreds. We buried him, removed the drawer in the kitchen, put him in, buried him.<br /><br />— And where did the mine come from?<br /><br />— ...it flew only from the factory, because all the sounds of these mines started from the side of the “Azovstal” plant. From time to time, shells flew in. Six houses were smashed around at once… On April 11, my wife and I went, we wanted to get Phoenix SIM cards. On the way home, they started shooting from the “Azovstal”… We lay down just in time, it covered us with earth.<br /><br />— 30 people entered the house of relatives on the side of my wife in Novoselovka. They were kicked out with their children. The husband was beaten. Two children: one is 12 years old, the other is 14. 10 days later, when they returned, the house was already ruined. Everything was smashed, everything was crumbled, everything was broken. Even in the cellar, everything was destroyed.<br /><br />The Ukranian military did not commit atrocities like “Azov”. No one said kind words (about &quot;Azov&quot;). They're just louts… We called them &quot;zarobitchans&quot;.<br /><br />They call home - here's a refrigerator ... &quot;Novaya Pochta&quot; did not have time to work... they really just robbed.<br /><br />To be continued.<br /><br />Source:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/grigoriev_maxim">https://t.me/grigoriev_maxim</a><br /><br />#ukraine #ukrainian #russia #russian #zelensky<br /><br />Subscribe to my Telegram channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/UkraineHumanRightsAbuses">https://t.me/UkraineHumanRightsAbuses</a><br /><br />Twitter: @Youblacksoul<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Youblacksoul?t=mJCfLyzOkp2CUm05Cv1gwQ&amp;s=09 ">https://twitter.com/Youblacksoul?t=mJCfLyzOkp2CUm05Cv1gwQ&amp;s=09 </a>{% endraw %}
