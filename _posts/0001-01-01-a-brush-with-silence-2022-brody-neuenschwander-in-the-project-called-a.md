{% raw %}In the project called “A Brush with Silence”, Brody Neuenschwander brings together calligraphers from the world’s many writing traditions for a silent calligraphic happening. Writers of Arabic, Chinese, Tibetan, Japanese, Hebrew, Greek, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Runes, codes and graffiti join forces with writers of English, German, French, Italian and Dutch to create a meditation in ink. The happening has now happened in eight countries, always to great crowds of silently enthusiastic visitors. “A Brush with Silence” is a perfect symbol of how humanity can live together in peaceful and beautiful tolerance.<br /><br />For the first time ever this event is brought to you with a livestream around the world.<br /><br />www.brushwithsilence.com{% endraw %}
