{% raw %}In this video, we explore the history of fixed filter banks in synthesizers (what they are, how they work), demonstrate some classic fixed filter bank concepts, and then dive into a series of patch examples exploring the Zlob Modular VC F3DB.<br /><br />Zlob Modular's VC F3DB is a filter bank for Eurorack modular synthesizers. But it's much more than just that as well; while it can produce the clean, dry, nasal tones you might expect from a classic Moog or Buchla filter bank, it is designed to leverage feedback, clipping, and per-band envelope followers, allowing it to act as a chaotic sound source, spectral decoder, and intense distortion.<br /><br />To access extended audio from this video (aaand there's a lot of it!), check out my Patreon page!
