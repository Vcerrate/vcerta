{% raw %}Dune! Lynch's? No. Jodorowski's? No. Villeneuve's my friend. And it's only half! Well, I did the whole movie, but it's only half the story. Am I going to have to rename this video when Part 2 comes out? Prolly. We all agreed this movie was pretty great, but I'm going to break down in EXPLICIT detail, why? So here's everything right with Dune!<br /><br />Support me through PATREON if you'd like: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/CinemaWins">https://www.patreon.com/CinemaWins</a><br /><br />CinemaWins Merch! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://standard.tv/collections/cinemawins">https://standard.tv/collections/cinemawins</a><br /><br />CinemaWins Socials:<br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/T3Joat">http://goo.gl/T3Joat</a>   <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/cdLfrb">http://goo.gl/cdLfrb</a>   <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/sqBQJy">http://goo.gl/sqBQJy</a>{% endraw %}
