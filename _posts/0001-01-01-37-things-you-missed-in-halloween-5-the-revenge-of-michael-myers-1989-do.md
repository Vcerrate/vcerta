After a relative success with Michael Myers's return a year prior, John Carpenter's iconic villain didn't have to wait long to take another crack at Haddonfield, IL. Although many fans would probably agree that Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers came with a significant drop in quality, it's still a part of the series, and we can analyze it with a similar approach to how we looked at previous entries.<br /><br />As with each of the previous four, the new director, Dominique Othenin-Girard, had his own take on the movie's message, this time trying to humanize it's iconic antagonist. For some reason.<br /><br />In this video I will be joined by Halloween franchise expert @Jimmy Champane  as we not only go through EVERYTHING you might have missed in the final Halloween movie of the 1980s, but also we'll be poking fun at it and putting the spotlight on some questions we had about the film. To learn why Michael's mask looks different... again, all of the callbacks referencing Halloween 1-4, and the meaning behind some of those hidden Michael Myers appearances throughout the film, stick around to the end of this video!<br /><br />#Halloween5 #HalloweenKills #RevengeOfMichaelMyers<br /><br />Chapters<br />0:00 | &quot;We'll Gather At The River&quot;<br />1:17 | Intro<br />2:35 | Why The Mask Looks Like That<br />2:59 | Michael's Motivation<br />3:27 | How The Opening Credits Tradition Continues<br />4:04 | Alfred Hitchcock Homage<br />4:47 | Jamie Michael Connection<br />5:51 | About Rachel...<br />6:17 | Zany Cops Circus Music What Is Going On Here<br />6:51 | Michael Spottings<br />7:56 | Michael Myers Big Sad<br />8:11 | The Scariest Part of this Movie Isn't What You Expected<br />9:07 | Crew Reference Easter Egg<br />9:22 | Halloween 1 Callbacks You Might Have Missed<br />10:12 | Halloween 2 and Halloween 4 Similarities<br />10:50 | Why Are Half The Jump Scares From Animals?<br />11:04 | Coraline's Mom, Dr. Disrespect and Other Questions<br />11:32 | Dr. Terrance Wynn in Halloween 5<br /><br />--About Halloween Kills--<br />The Halloween night when Michael Myers returned isnâ€™t over yet. Minutes after Laurie Strode (Curtis), her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) left masked monster Michael Myers caged and burning in Laurieâ€™s basement, Laurie is rushed to the hospital with life-threatening injuries, believing she finally killed her lifelong tormentor. But when Michael manages to free himself from Laurieâ€™s trap, his ritual bloodbath resumes.
