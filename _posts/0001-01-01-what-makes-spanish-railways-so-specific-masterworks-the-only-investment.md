Namely, you can barely find a country with four different track gauges, well-developed high-speed rail network, fascinating landscapes, including beautiful nature, deserts, canyons, sierras and unique villages, and plenty of different rail services provided by several public and private railway operators. <br /><br />As we usually do in these kind of series, this video will deal with the development and overview of the Spanish railways, the next one will cover the development of Spanish high-speed rail system, and the third will show the evolution of Spanish high-speed trains.<br /><br />The story about the development and overview of the Spanish railways, include the historical aspect of the development of railways in Spain, the reform of the old RENFE and the railway sector (formation of ADIF and AVE), and, as an inevitable part of course some facts and figures about the traffic and the market. <br /><br />Do you think we managed to present the main aspects of the Spanish railway system?
