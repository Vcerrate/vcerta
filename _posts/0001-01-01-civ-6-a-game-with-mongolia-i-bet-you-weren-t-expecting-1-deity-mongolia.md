{% raw %}In this game of Civ 6, we’ll be returning to Civilization VI and it’s wonderful array of TSL maps. This time, an earth TSL map in all it’s glory. Unfortunately with a neighbouring China but that is besides the point.<br /><br />We all know Mongolia as an S tier war civ, but did you know that’s not how they are built in Civ 6? Not at all – Mongolia is actually an S+ tier peace civ. Let me show you how.<br /><br />I bet this is not the game you were expecting to see today!<br /><br />All maps, mods and tech support on getting these games to work are available on my discord, so swing by!<br /><br />Make sure you subscribe below so you don't miss more Deity Civilization VI fun!<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />02:27 - Turn 1<br />03:48 - Settle Time<br />06:12 - Don't Tempt Me Korea, Please<br />06:45 - Why This Start Is So Hard<br />08:00 - Told Ya<br />09:31 - Round 2<br />12:33 - Yes Korea!!!<br />15:45 - Pantheon Time!!<br />18:35 - Ursa Has A Moan<br />21:46 - Religion Time<br />25:23 - Weird Governor Opener<br />29:54 - This Will Be A Weird Game!<br />33:55 - Get Off My Things Georgia<br />36:12 - Masterclass on Alliances<br />39:01 - Peace Begins With A Smile<br />41:34 - Genghis Doesn't Need A Horse To Kill<br />44:20 - Oh Yes<br /><br />Ko-fi - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/ursaryan">https://ko-fi.com/ursaryan</a><br />Discord - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/QHB3AM3">https://discord.gg/QHB3AM3</a><br />Patreon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/ursaryan">https://www.patreon.com/ursaryan</a><br />Subscribe - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCEBBOJXdQ3lwoCtYkCnIRQ?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCEBBOJXdQ3lwoCtYkCnIRQ?sub_confirmation=1</a>{% endraw %}
