{% raw %}üëâ Checkout PART 1 HERE for CRAZY EDGE CLEANUP! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/u8pKdHpjNqg">https://youtu.be/u8pKdHpjNqg</a><br /><br />Today you will see me tackle one of the most overgrown lawns that I have worked on.<br /><br />I was mowing for an elderly man across the street (future video) when I saw this house and how overgrown the grass was. As I was finishing up, I flagged down the homeowner when they were walking to their car. We got to talking and I asked them if I could mow and edge their yard for FREE. Little did I know this would take me 3 full evenings‚Ä¶<br /><br />This is some of the most overgrown grass that I have seen. As I was edging it, I was peeling parts of turf off that were almost 100 lbs! As you will notice, I got into a process to cut back the edges.<br /><br />This process includes:<br /><br />1. Cutting down the tall grass around the edges with the trimmer - This time, I used my residential grade Echo SRM 225. As you can see, it did really well for me and provided all the power that I needed. I chose to use this because it was REALLY hot and it is the lightest trimmer I have.<br /><br />2. Defining the edge with the metal blade stick edger - For this, I used my residential grade Echo PE-225. This edger is awesome and super light weight. There are times where I could use a little bit more power, but after this job, I couldn‚Äôt be happier with it.<br /><br />3. Scraping the grass and turf off the cement with my garden shovel - This part is by far the most tiring as I am picking up heavy dirt and grass over and over. However, this is a necessary step because I can‚Äôt run my mower over these turf strips to suck them into the bag.<br /><br />4. Blow away the remaining dirt and debris - I used my commercial grade Echo PB-9010T for this. It was the MVP of this job. Without its power, it may have taken me an extra day or two to complete this.<br /><br />After about 8 hours of work over 2 evenings, I finally revealed the entire sidewalk. I had around 10 bags filled with dirt and grass. Each bag was so heavy that I couldn‚Äôt pick it up and had to drag it back to the curb.<br /><br />The 3rd evening is when I was finally able to trim and mow the tall grass down. <br /><br />This transformation is one of the most labor intensive I have ever done, but the results are worth it!<br /><br />The homeowner was absolutely shocked at how the lawn looked. They kept telling me how they never knew they had that much sidewalk. I am so happy that I could help get their lawn looking as it should and it will make their lives easier when mowing in the future. Doing this made my heart happy and I was glad that I was able to help someone out. I hope to do more of these overgrown lawn makeover videos soon and spread some good in the world (especially now because we really need it).<br /><br /><br />If you enjoyed the video, please like and subscribe so that I can continue to put out content like this.
