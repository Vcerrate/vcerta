{% raw %}After hearing Jesus speak on repentance, someone in the crowd asked a single question: “Are only a few people going to be saved?” Jesus’ response—that one day the door to heaven will be closed and those who did not know Him will be shut out—is one of the most chilling in all of Scripture. In this message, Alistair Begg considers Jesus’ reply and exhorts us to repent before the opportunity to do so has passed.<br /><br />Scripture: Luke 13:22<br />Preached: March 18, 2001{% endraw %}
