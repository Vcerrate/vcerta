I'm a swing Forex trader and help aspiring Forex traders develop a trading method that works for them so they can produce income allowing them to live with more freedom.  <br /><br />I blog at www.desiretotrade.com and host the Desire To Trade Podcast. I was fed up with the ‚Äúfake‚Äù millionaire traders and the ‚Äúget-rich-quick-trading guys‚Äù. That's why you can expect more free content from me than what other people charge for!<br /><br />If you truly want to succeed in Forex trading, I believe you need to keep working on yourself so you can improve your strengths, but also your weaknesses. Do not focus solely on what you're good at.<br /><br />// Disclaimer<br />This video expresses my personal opinion only. Forex trading is risky. Make sure you are ready to trade. Even this will not guarantee you positive results. I am not responsible for any losses incurred due to your trading or anything else. I do not recommend any specific trade or action.<br /><br />AFFILIATE LINKS<br />Thank you for trusting me with my truthful and reliable opinion on any future purchase you may make. I always disclose this information when it is the case. As part of the Desire To TRADE family, you allow me to be able to use affiliate/referral links when suggesting items for purchase. As a customer of the products I refer, you help me sustain the time and resources to create content on this channel by generating revenue from your sales.
