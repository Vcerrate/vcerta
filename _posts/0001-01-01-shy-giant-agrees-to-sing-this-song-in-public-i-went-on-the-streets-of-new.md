{% raw %}I went on the streets of New York and asked random people to sing with me. That's when I met Connor Daly! I'm glad he took the time to sing with me. Having watched some of my videos just the day before, he and his family welcomed some impromptu music on their New York Trip. Connor Daly can be fond on Instagram as @Connordalymusic<br /><br />As a musician, I'm all about creating musical experiences that have people feeling happy and free, and that's why the &quot;Sing With Me&quot; series exists. Since 2018, I have asked thousands of random people to sing with me on camera. A lot of people have said no, some have said no initially but changed their minds to yes, and some have said yes right away. I ask these people to sing with one purpose: to create a way for them to experience a sense of happiness and freedom they did not feel before. And much of the time, this actually works (and that makes ME happy).<br /><br />Would you like me to host a &quot;Sing With Me&quot; at your next private event? Contact me for pricing and availability. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.guitaro5000.com/singwithmeprivate">https://www.guitaro5000.com/singwithmeprivate</a><br /><br />Would you like to assist me in doing &quot;Sing With Me for Free&quot; publicly in your city?
