It is a fallacy that narcissistic parents breed narcissists.  This is not the common case.  Actually, children of narcissistic parents tend to be quite different, and we’re going to discuss that in this video and how you can help yourself if you’re a child of a narcissistic parent.  If you haven’t seen part 1, you may want to go and check it out before diving into this one, as I explored the environment and family rules and messages and how they’re exhibited. <br /><br />Adult children of narcissistic parents tend to have the following personality characteristics, beliefs, and views to different degrees.  I’d like you to go and get a piece of paper or something you can mark off how much these characteristics, beliefs, and views are a part of you.  As I go through these, rate each from 0 to 5; 0 being nothing like me and 5 being absolutely like me.<br /><br />Self-sacrifice<br />Self-blame <br />Buried by guilt <br />Compulsive caretaker <br />Conditional Approval <br />Perpetual perfection <br />All mistakes and all consequences <br />Gratitude giver <br />Internalized narcissism <br />Hero/zero <br />Need to be needed <br />Emotional Minimization <br />Dirty competition <br />Diffuse boundaries <br /><br />When you look over your ratings, take notice of those rated with a 4 or a 5.  These are likely to be some pretty intense traits that influence how you live your life and see yourself and others. You can get control over these things, and do it differently.<br /><br />Please remember, we’re all different in how our environments impacted us.  This is why it’s so important to understand what makes up our personality, beliefs, and views so we can grow and develop from the knowledge.  Remember, knowledge is empowerment. <br /><br />Daniel J.
