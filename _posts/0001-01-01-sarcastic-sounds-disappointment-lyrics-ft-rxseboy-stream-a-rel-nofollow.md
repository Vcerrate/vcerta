Oh my gosh I'm late for work again&quot;<br />I'm a peice of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell<br />In my mama crib kinda feeling like I'm twelve<br />I would throw my whole allowance in the fountain, empty out my bank account<br />But with my luck it probably wouldn't even help<br />Dawg I got no job, no mic, with a girl I don't like<br />Nothing ever goes right, I'm tight (for real)<br />I told myself I'm gonna be fine almost a million times I know that I can do whatever it takes<br />But when it all crumbles and crashes I'll be back on my ass, and I already know what I'm gonna say<br /><br />I'm a disappointment <br />I stay up, take drugs and miss appointments<br />Then complain about the outcome of my choices<br />It feels pointless when I try to avoid all of the thoughts in my head<br />Lately I just wait on<br />One good reason I should even try to wake up<br />'Cause that shit feels like a motherfucking day job<br />With no days off, I hope I get laid off to lay in my bed<br />My bed<br />-----------<br /><br />If you are the owner of any content that has been uploaded on this channel and you want it removed please contact and I will resolve the issue immediately.{% endraw %}
