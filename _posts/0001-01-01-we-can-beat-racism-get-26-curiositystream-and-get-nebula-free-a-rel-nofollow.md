I agree, however, not to give or sell any of your information to any parties unafilliated with video production on this channel.<br />1. No one will ever answer this number, it should always go straight to voicemail, so don't expect to talk to a human.<br />2. It is very, very, unlikely that anyone will call or text you back. If you get a response, it will be in a public way, such as when part of a video.<br />3. There's a caller ID, so I will generally be able to see the number you called from. As mentioned above, none of this information will be shared or used, but if that makes you uncomfortable then I suggest not calling. I also suggest that you do not share any unecessary personal information.<br />4. Your basic rates and charges for calls, whatever they may be, will still apply.<br />5. Your voicemail might be used for or responded to in a future video!<br /><br />Did you see a unpleasant ad on my channel?
