{% raw %}Jackbox gave us early access to The Party Pack 8. Lets check out some of the games! <br />STREAMS! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/Chilledchaos">http://www.twitch.tv/Chilledchaos</a> (Live with Among Us!)<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />What is in Jackbox Party Pack 8?<br />Drawful Animate<br />(3 -10 players) - It’s alive! The guessing game with terrible drawings and hilariously wrong answers makes a dynamic return. In this revamped title, players create looping, two-frame animations based on weird and random titles..<br /><br />The Wheel of Enormous Proportions<br />(2-8 players) - Trivia has never been so large! A fantastic, mystical wheel challenges you with a variety of trivia prompts. Winners are awarded slices of the Wheel’s face with a chance to win big with each nail-biting spin. In the end, one player will have their most burning question answered by the great Wheel..<br /><br />Job Job<br />(3-10 players) - Use other people’s words to create unique and funny answers to classic job interview questions. Go head to head to see who scores the job!.<br /><br />The Poll Mine<br />(2-10 players) - A survey game that’s all about YOU! Split into teams and see who can escape from the witch’s lair! Players individually rank their choices to a difficult question, then must guess how the group answered as a whole. How well do you know your friends?!.<br /><br />Weapons Drawn<br />(4-8 players) - A social deduction game where everyone is both a murderer and a detective. Players doodle all the clues, hiding a letter from their name in the weapon drawings. Can you solve murders while trying to get away with your own?<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />If you want non livestream content subscribe to my main Youtube channel<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CriousGamers">https://www.youtube.com/user/CriousGamers</a><br /><br />Want updates in case YouTube or Twitch breaks, follow me on twitter.
