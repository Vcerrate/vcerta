{% raw %}Ready to talk about top down burns? We are at the Chimney Safety Institute of America. Make sure that you've got your firewood ready, and that it's seasoned. Then follow the steps that veteran CSIA Instructor Bob Fish has. The type of fireplace doesn't matter. A top down approach, instead of log cabin style, should work very well.<br />The burn efficiency means less creosote in the chimney, long term. Make sure that before you use your fireplace or wood stove, that you know the shape it's in. That's where a CSIA Certified Chimney Sweep can come in handy. You can find a professional in your zip code by using the search engine locator on our website, csia.org/search.{% endraw %}
