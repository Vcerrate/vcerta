{% raw %}Putin humiliated as 300 troops 'hitchhike home' after feeling they were 'left for dead'<br />A post on Twitter claims to show troops from South Ossetia - a region the Georgian government considers a part of its territory - arriving on the border of Russia.<br />Alik Puhati, a writer from the Ossetia region, said: “Today, about 300 soldiers (mostly ethnic Ossetians) from the Russian military base returned to South Ossetia of their own free will, because they thought they had been left for dead during a special operation in Ukraine.<br /><br />&quot;The former president of South Ossetia called not to draw hasty conclusions and not to accuse the guys of desertion, but to carefully investigate the situation when soldiers are sent to combat operations without full outfit and stocks of weapons, warm clothing and protective equipment.&quot;<br /><br />Accompanying an image of soldiers, he added: &quot;Returned soldiers on the border of Russia and South Ossetia.<br /><br />“They hitchhiked home.”<br />South Ossetiais of significant importance to the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia.<br /><br />The breakaway region says plans are in place to become part of the Russian Federation.<br /><br />Russia recognised South Ossetia as an independent state in 2008 after fighting a short war with Georgia.{% endraw %}
