{% raw %}Today Architectural Digest brings you to Malibu, California to visit the Koenig Beach House, a glass-enclosed cliffside dream mansion currently on the market for just under $25 million. Designed by the late world-renowned architect Pierre Koenig, his namesake beach house is a one-of-a-kind marvel with 4 bedrooms and 5 baths across 4,000 square feet of interior space. Being in Malibu is about being outdoors though, so a retractable walkway offers private access to the pristine sandy beach below while a sleek car elevator gets your wheels down the hill and on the road with panache.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thumbnail photo by Nils Timm @nilstimmvisuals<br /><br /><br /><br />Fredrik Eklund, Sean Landon, and Jennifer Johnson of Eklund|Gomes at Douglas Elliman<br /><br />Want even more AD?
