So, anyone who is deemed to have affronted the Queen, or behaved badly in that regard, is just not going to go down well.&quot;<br />The award-winning author referenced the joke Rebel Wilson made about the infamous Oprah interview at the this year's' BAFTA awards.<br /><br />#MeghanMarkle #PiersMorgan #CeliaWalden{% endraw %}
