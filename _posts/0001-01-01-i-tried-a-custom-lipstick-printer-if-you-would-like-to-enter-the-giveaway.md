So, a couple of years ago I saw this custom lipstick printer in a video about the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas, and ever since, I have been desperate to get my hand so it! And now, after a few years, a few waiting lists, and a couple restocks, I have it. So today, we're going to be testing out the YSL Rouge Sur Mesure custom lipstick printer, which lets you choose custom lipstick colors to print, will recommend your lipstick colors based on your outfit, and will also let you take photos of things in the world and then print matching color lipsticks to them. So we're going to take this thing for a spin! Which color did you like the most? Do you want to see Urn Burgundy??<br /><br />Also - Closed Captions will be up ASAP!<br /><br />This video is NOT sponsored!!<br /><br />Check out our merch shop here!! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fiendishbehavior.com/">https://fiendishbehavior.com/</a><br /><br />My Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​">https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​</a><br />My TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?">https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?</a><br />Our new livestreaming channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler">https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler</a><br />Our new YouTube Shorts channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig</a><br /><br />MUSIC<br />Via AudioNetwork<br /><br />PRODUCED &amp; EDITED by<br />Safiya Nygaard<br />Tyler Williams<br />Nez Covington<br />Hannah Bruce<br /><br />GFX by Dayana Espinoza<br /><br />#beauty #gadget #lipstick{% endraw %}
