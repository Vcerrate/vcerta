{% raw %}For the best part of a decade, France has attempted to tackle Islamist insurgencies in the Sahel, a semi-arid region of Africa lying in an arc below the Sahara. Centred on Mali, the mission - Operation Barkhane - has now grown to include counter-terrorism operations in Burkina Faso and Niger. However, the French campaign is now in serious difficulties. As well as failing to rein in Islamist groups, Paris is now increasingly at odds with the Malian Government and facing growing public hostility. This has led many to ask whether France is now facing its own Afghanistan. Waging a seemingly unwinnable war, it can't stay - but nor can it leave.<br /><br />Hello and welcome!

Indeed, it has intervened well over 60 times in the region since then (more likely far more). However, its most significant mission has been in the Sahel, where it has been playing a leading role alongside the armed forces of the other countries of the regions (G5) in taking on various Islamist insurgent groups. However, since taking the lead on the mission in Mali, in 2013, it has faced growing difficulties. With the death toll now believed to be well over 10,000, and almost 4 million now believed to be in dire need of humanitarian assistance, relations with Mali have collapsed following two military coups own the country. Meanwhile, efforts to establish a wider European force, Task Force Takuba, are also running into difficulties. This now calls into question whether the mission has failed, and, if so, what France can now do about the situation.<br /><br />CHAPTERS<br />0:00 Introductions and Titles<br />0:22 The War on Terror in the Sahel<br />1:25 The Sahel Region <br />2:04 The Sahel: Islam and French Colonisation<br />3:04 Tackling Islamist Extremism in the Sahel<br />4:53 Operation Barkhane: Counter-Insurgency in the Sahel<br />5:55 Task Force Takuba and Mounting Problems <br />9:25 France in the Sahel: Can’t Stay, Can’t Leave<br />11:48 France’s Unwinnable War in the Sahel?<br /><br />RELATED PLAYLISTS<br />Current Issues and Disputes <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUzSOLzcfKuNQmS9wQNIIKzYLUlBTyHnb">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUzSOLzcfKuNQmS9wQNIIKzYLUlBTyHnb</a><br />Secession and Independence in Africa <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUzSOLzcfKuNVZfOBg0dtK1D-ZH1ca8cB">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUzSOLzcfKuNVZfOBg0dtK1D-ZH1ca8cB</a><br /><br />===============<br />FURTHER READING &amp; USEFUL SOURCES<br /><br />French Ministry of the Armed Forces [LINK]<br />Ministère des Armées YouTube Channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Y9vEv67BYRhgbRwJGj35w">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Y9vEv67BYRhgbRwJGj35w</a><br />France Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/">https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/</a><br />MINUSMA <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://minusma.unmissions.org/en">https://minusma.unmissions.org/en</a><br />French Military Operations Since 1960 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/pdf/rap-info/i2777.pdf">https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/pdf/rap-info/i2777.pdf</a><br />LINK [LINK]<br /><br />===============<br />MY BOOKS<br /><br />Secession and State Creation: What Everyone Needs to Know <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MPY3W2">https://amzn.to/2MPY3W2</a> [PRE-ORDER]<br />The Cyprus Problem: What Everyone Needs to Know <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2FaaBU2">https://amzn.to/2FaaBU2</a><br />Kosovo: The Path to Contested Statehood in the Balkans <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35jiBN2">https://amzn.to/35jiBN2</a><br />The Foreign Policy of Counter-Secession <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Qinm5t">https://amzn.to/2Qinm5t</a><br />My other books <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MlP13u">https://amzn.to/2MlP13u</a><br /><br />===============<br />MY PROFILES &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS<br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/JamesKerLindsay">http://www.twitter.com/JamesKerLindsay</a><br />LinkedIn <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-ker-lindsay-b31b9930/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-ker-lindsay-b31b9930/</a><br />Academia.edu <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lse.academia.edu/JamesKerLindsay">https://lse.academia.edu/JamesKerLindsay</a><br />Research Gate <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Ker-Lindsay">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Ker-Lindsay</a><br /><br />===============<br />EQUIPMENT&amp; TOOL USED TO MAKE THIS VIDEO<br /><br />Camera: Canon XA40 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3CLinzy">https://amzn.to/3CLinzy</a><br />Microphone: Røde VideoMic NTG <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MAHBZj">https://amzn.to/2MAHBZj</a><br />Key Light: Elgato <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3D85kJx">https://amzn.to/3D85kJx</a><br />Accent Lights: Aputure MC <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3kkoGSS">https://amzn.to/3kkoGSS</a> <br />Teleprompter: Parrot 2 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VLcRsm">https://amzn.to/2VLcRsm</a><br />Tripod: Geekoto 79&quot; Carbon Fibre <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2wWMNT1">https://amzn.to/2wWMNT1</a><br />Channel Analytics: TubeBuddy <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/JKL">https://www.tubebuddy.com/JKL</a><br />Channel Graphics: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://motionvfx.sjv.io/NKB34O">https://motionvfx.sjv.io/NKB34O</a><br /><br />===============<br />KEYWORDS<br /><br />#France #Sahel #Mali<br />#InternationalPolitics #CurrentAffairs #InternationalRelations<br />#Insurgency #Statehood #Independence #Francafrique<br />#InternationalLaw #InternationalHistory<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Some of the links above are affiliate links.
