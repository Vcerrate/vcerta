{% raw %}Should you strive to be the perfect leader?<br /><br />One question that we ask in our Frontline Leadership class is, &quot;If you think back to all the leaders for whom you have worked, what percentage of them were good leaders and what percentage were not good?&quot; Usually, it turns out to be a coin toss, you have good leaders, and you may have bad ones too. Very few people have a consistent set of great leaders.<br /><br />When you think of your good leaders, are they perfect? Or do they have flaws? Most people will say that even the best leaders have flaws. If your team knows that you care about doing the best job that you can and that you have their best interests at heart, then they are also going to cut you a bit of slack.<br /><br />This is not excusing bad leadership. Leaders cannot really be perfect.<br /><br />Use these tips to work towards excellence, not perfection{% endraw %}
