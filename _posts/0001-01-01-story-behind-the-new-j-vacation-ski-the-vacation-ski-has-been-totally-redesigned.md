{% raw %}“The Vacation” ski has been totally redesigned with a completely new innovative flex pattern and shape. I’ve  maintained the reliable flex in the tip and tail, while softening the flex under foot. This improves its ability to naturally conform to a larger variety of freestyle terrain and tight transitions with unprecedented comfort. You gain a much more playful feel for buttering and throwing tricks with less effort, while maintaining solid big air landings and high speed reliability. <br /><br />I also completely updated the tip geometry for a much surfier, effortless, nimble feel when maneuvering in the pow, even in the tightest of trees. With this new tip shape you’ll never worry again about catching your tips when buttering, popping to switch at high speed or throwing tricks in variable snow anywhere on the mountain. <br /><br />This ski is the ultimate getaway.... from traditional boring skis! If your idea of fun is to slash, butter, press, air, nollie &amp; jib your way down the hill from untracked pow to the groomers and everywhere in between, it’s time for a NEW Vacation!<br /><br />Learn more: jskis.com/collections/vacation{% endraw %}
