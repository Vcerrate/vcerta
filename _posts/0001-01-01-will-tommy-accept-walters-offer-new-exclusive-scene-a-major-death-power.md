{% raw %}In Power Book 4 Force Episode 8 we're gonna see Walter Flynn offering Tommy a proposition, one where he wants him to join the Flynn Family Organisation, but the thing is with Tommy, he's been there and done that where he's worked for someone else before and now that he's running his own hustle, will he go back to working for someone else?  It depends on what Walter Flynn's offer really is, but I highly doubt he would be relinquishing any sort of Power because we all know how controlling he is, after all, he called himself 'The Devil' So will Tommy accept The Devils offer? <br /><br />Exclusive Clip: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YxXpgKdp1g&amp;ab_channel=blackfilmandtv">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YxXpgKdp1g&amp;ab_channel=blackfilmandtv</a><br /><br />ðŸ””: Let's face it, if you've reached this far down the description box then you may as well hit the subscribe button (: <br />ðŸ“²: SOCIAL MEDIA: Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ig.moviebot/">https://www.instagram.com/ig.moviebot/</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/moviebot__">https://twitter.com/moviebot__</a> <br /><br />#PowerForce #PowerBookIVForce #TommyEgan{% endraw %}
