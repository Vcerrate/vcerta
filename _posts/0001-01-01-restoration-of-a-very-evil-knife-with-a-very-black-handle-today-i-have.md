{% raw %}Today I have the third of the four knives that I bought at auction on my desktop.<br />For this knife, I chose a block of very black stabilized wood!<br />Recovery process:<br />Rust was removed from metal by electrolysis. Electrolyte made from soda and water. I set the current to 5-7 Amperes, and left it like that until the morning!<br />Then I just had to wash off the dark coating.<br />This knife had a rather unusual handle, and I had to divide a block of wood into four parts.<br />Then I glued everything together using epoxy glue. After the glue had dried, I processed the handle on a grinding wheel, and then a lot of work with a rasp and a file.<br />In the end, I cleaned the handle with sandpaper, I used from 240 to 2000 grit. Then covered with Kornauba wax and polished with a felt wheel.<br /><br />I really liked the result, I hope you do too.<br />There are many more cool and interesting videos on the channel, I will be grateful if you watch some of them!<br /><br />Good luck to you all and take care of yourself!<br /><br />See you next week!<br />Best regards Max!<br /><br />#rusty <br />#knife<br />#restoration{% endraw %}
