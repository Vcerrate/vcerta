{% raw %}The Avalanche of Apostasy continues! Here are some brief testimonies of ex-Muslims and their friends that I found in the comments section in March! One is from a girl whose father is an Islamic scholar and who memorized the entire Quran before realizing she no longer believes in Islam! May God bless the brave men, women, boys, and girls who are putting themselves at risk by rejecting Muhammad.<br /><br />#ExMuslims #Apostasy{% endraw %}
