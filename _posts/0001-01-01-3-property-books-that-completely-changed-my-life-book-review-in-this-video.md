Like many young people, I was very much living in the today and now and as a result was very lacklustre when it came to budgeting, spending habits and savings. I would spend most of what I earned, with very little regard to the future. <br /> <br />Deep in my overdraft with little to no savings, I decided enough was enough. I began doing my own research, reading various books on personal development, finance and business and managed to pay off all of my consumer debt. <br /> <br />As Dave Ramsey said ‚ÄúPersonal finance is only 20% head knowledge and 80% behaviour‚Äù. It is not technically challenging, so much as it is socially challenging. But I truly believe everyone has the ability to reach financial freedom regardless of their income, background or upbringing. The goal of this channel is to give you the motivation required to become financially free.<br /><br />-------------       DISCLAIMER     --------------- <br />I am not a qualified financial advisor, and the content found on this channel is for educational and entertainment purposes only.
