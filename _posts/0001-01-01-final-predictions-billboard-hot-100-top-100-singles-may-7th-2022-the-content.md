Chart rankings are based on sales (physical and digital), radio play, and online streaming in the United States.<br /><br />The weekly tracking period for sales was initially Monday to Sunday when Nielsen started tracking sales in 1991, but was changed to Friday to Thursday in July 2015. This tracking period also applies to compiling online streaming data. Radio airplay, which, unlike sales figures and streaming, is readily available on a real-time basis, is tracked on a Monday to Sunday cycle (previously Wednesday to Tuesday). A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public by Billboard on Tuesdays.<br /><br />The first number one song of the Billboard Hot 100 was &quot;&quot;Poor Little Fool&quot;&quot; by Ricky Nelson, on August 4, 1958&quot;<br /><br />This video was uploaded by Billboard Top Songs. &quot;Billboard Radio Songs&quot; © 2021 Billboard/Eldridge/Nielsen<br /><br />My Social Medias:<br />&quot;☑️ Subscribe! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3jr7dak">https://bit.ly/3jr7dak</a><br />♫ Main channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2DYYags">https://bit.ly/2DYYags</a><br />✪ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3jnFVBE&quot;">https://bit.ly/3jnFVBE&quot;</a><br /><br />#Billboard #Predicitions #Hot100 #Top100 #BestSongs #BestMusic #BillboardRadioSongs #YouTube #Spotify #Deezer #AppleMusic #Radios<br /><br />Tags:<br />24kGoldn, 42 Dugg, 50 Cent, A7S, AJR, Anuel AA, Ariana Grande, Ashley McBryde, ATR Son Son, Ava Max, Bad Bunny, beabadoobee, Beyonce, Billie Eilish, blackbear, BLACKPINK, Blake Shelton , Brray, BTS, Calvin Harris, Cardi B, Chase Rice, Chris Brown, Chris Janson, Chris Stapleton, Chris Tomlin, Conan Gray, DaBaby, Dan + Shay, Devin Dawson, DJ Khaled, Doja Cat, Don Toliver, Drake, Dua Lipa, Emilee, Florida Georgia Line, Future, Gabby Barrett, Gucci Mane, Gunna, Gwen Stefani, HARDY, Harry Styles, Hillary Scott, iann dior, Internet Money, J Balvin, Jack Harlow, Jameson Rodgers, Jason Aldean, Jason Derulo, Jawsh 685, Jon Pardi, JP Saxe, Juanka, Juice WRLD, Julia Michaels, Justin Bieber, Justin Moore, Kane Brown, Keith Urban, Khalid, Lady Gaga, Lauren Alaina, Lee Brice, Lewis Capaldi, Lil Baby, Lil Durk, Lil Mosey, Lil Tjay, Lil Wayne, Luke Bryan, Luke Combs, Machine Gun Kelly, Maddie &amp; Tae, Maluma, Maren Morris, Maroon 5, Marshmello, Megan Thee Stallion, Migos, Miley Cyrus, Money Man, Moneybagg Yo, Morgan Wallen, Myke Towers, NAV, Nicki Minaj, Nio Garcia, Ozuna, Parker McCollum, Polo G, Pop Smoke, Post Malone, Powfu, Quavo, Reba McEntire, Rod Wave, Roddy Ricch, SAINt JHN, Saweetie, Selena Gomez, StaySolidRocky, surf mesa, Swae Lee, Tainy, Tate McRae, Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, Thomas Rhett, Tim McGraw, Topic, Tory Lanez, Trippie Redd, Ty Dolla $ign, WhoHeem, Young Thug, YoungBoy Never Broke Again{% endraw %}
