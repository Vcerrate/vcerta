{% raw %}By popular demand, here is Disney's latest entry to the iconic Disney Princess family; 'Encanto'! A story about the only Madrigal child with no powers, Mirabel goes on a quest to find out what's hurting her family's magic.<br /><br />Released in theaters and now available on Disney+,  audiences and critics seem to love this movie, and after seeing it for myself, here are some of my thoughts! <br /><br />UPDATE:<br />To avoid repeating comments, here's to clear things up:<br /><br />1. I'm not calling Mirabel a princess, I called her a Disney princess, two very different things. You don't have to be a princess/royalty to be a Disney princess.<br /><br />2. Yes, she's a Disney princess. It's a Disney princess movie. I based the script off of the Disney wiki, if you're against that source of information then that's not my problem. <br /><br />2. I don't count Dolores's 'soundproof room' which was confirmed by the creators cause it was never mentioned/established in the movie.<br /><br />3. No, I didn't call Antonio Mirabel's brother, I said she &quot;sees&quot; him as a brother, I'm aware he's her cousin.<br /><br />4. Dolores's &quot;I can hear him now&quot; can interpreted in both ways, either she was talking about Mariano or Bruno. I personally think Lin did that on purpose.<br /><br />5. I had to gloss through the last three songs cause the video was already too long as it is, to those who wanted my input on it, I'm sorry :( But here are my thoughts on them:<br /><br />‚Ä¢ What Else Can I Do?<br />Probably the most upbeat song, I like it a lot. The colors plus Isabella and Mirabel's voice blend so well. Lyrics are not as deep as 'Surface Pressure' but it's still great <br /><br />‚Ä¢ Dos Oruguitas<br />Underrated. With the song coupled with the flashback scene/Abuela &amp; Mirabel hugging scene makes it hit even harder. The song is simple and that's what makes it great. (I recommend listening to the Spanish version though)<br /><br />‚Ä¢ All of You<br />Not the strongest entry, but serves well for a finale.<br /><br /><br />0:00 Opening Skit<br />0:43 Intro<br />2:03 Welcome to Encanto<br />3:13 Opening Number<br />4:10 Animation and Visuals<br />4:54 Meet the Madrigals<br />10:15 The 'I Want' Princess Solo<br />11:05 Conflict<br />12:58 Surface Pressure<br />13:28 The Vision<br />14:51 Let's Talk About Bruno<br />16:23 Dinner Scene<br />17:00 Inside the Walls<br />18:21 Fixing the Miracle<br />20:33 Fixing the Family<br />22:58 Verdict<br /><br /><br />Thanks for watching üçØ<br />--<br />SOCIALS:<br />TikTok ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@beaniiebrian?">https://www.tiktok.com/@beaniiebrian?</a><br />Twitch ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/beaniiebrian">https://www.twitch.tv/beaniiebrian</a><br />Twitter ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/beaniiebrian">https://www.twitter.com/beaniiebrian</a><br />Instagram ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beaniiebrian">https://www.instagram.com/beaniiebrian</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE CONENT!<br />Main Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/beaniiebrian">https://www.youtube.com/c/beaniiebrian</a><br />Variety Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/beaniie">https://www.youtube.com/c/beaniie</a><br />--<br /><br />Have a great day and a great life!<br /><br />#disney #encanto{% endraw %}
