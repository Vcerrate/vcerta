{% raw %}Lyrics:<br />I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill<br />I threw the day old tea from the cup<br />Packed up the photo album Matthew had made<br />Memories of a life that's been loved<br />Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals<br />Poured the old ginger beer down the sink<br />Dad always told me, &quot;don't you cry when you're down&quot;<br />But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink<br />Oh I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know<br />A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved<br />So I'll sing Hallelujah<br />You were an angel in the shape of my mum<br />When I fell down you'd be there holding me up<br />Spread your wings as you go<br />And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah<br />You're home<br />I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up<br />Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case<br />John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek<br />And wiped a tear from the side of my face<br />I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know<br />A life with love is a life that's been lived<br />So I'll sing Hallelujah<br />You were an angel in the shape of my mum<br />When I fell down you'd be there holding me up<br />Spread your wings as you go<br />And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah<br />You're home<br />Hallelujah<br />You were an angel in the shape of my mum<br />You got to see the person that I have become<br />Spread your wing<br />And I know that when God took you back he said Hallelujah<br />You're home <br /><br />All rights by Ed Sheeran.<br /><br />This is a work whose sole purpose is to supply the need of some users, to repeat the same song several times. I hope you like it{% endraw %}
