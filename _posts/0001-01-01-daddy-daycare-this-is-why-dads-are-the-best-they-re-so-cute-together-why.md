{% raw %}Why do Dads have to break all the rules, why do they get away with everything too and do all the fun stuff. Oh wait, that's because they are big kids too.... Watch Amelia as she ditches the little kids play area and ventures into the 'big kids' playground! She's been here loads of times it's so cool its like a giant adult playground! They even have VR trampolining but that was supervised so we couldn't sneak past that haha. Its called playfactore under the chill factore by the Trafford centre in Manchester. Definitely worth a visit, although their snack prices are more than the cinema! Anyway Amelia loves the place and it but she had a taste of the dark side from early on so she gives up un the toddler bit pretty quick! Little thrill seeker......{% endraw %}
