{% raw %}Try not to laugh as I call an overprotective MOM as Abdo, who wants to date her daughter. I called and pranked the mom, telling her that Abdo wants to whisk the daughter away forever and Mom might never see her again. This is the Mom's worst nightmare as she had her own very bad experience dating a middle eastern man. This gets funnier and funnier as it goes along.
