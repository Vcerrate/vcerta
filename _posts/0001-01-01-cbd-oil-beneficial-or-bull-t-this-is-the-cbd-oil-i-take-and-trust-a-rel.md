DISCLAIMER: he’s not recommending that you use CBD oil.  You need to do your own research. In this video men’s style, grooming, fitness and lifestyle expert, Aaron Marino of IAmAlphaM, AaronMarino, Pete &amp; Pedro , Ollie , and ENEMY  is discussing what he’s experienced by using CBD oil daily for the last 7 months.<br /><br />The Issue with CBD<br />The issue is CBD is that ANYONE can make their own private label CBD oil company. There are so many brands — what are potency are you taking? You have no idea unless you have a super pure form of CBD oil and a company that is tested and standardized. Plant Therapy is not only tested and standardized, but the company has been around for years, specializing in extracts, essential oils, and oil therapy.<br /><br />Why Did Alpha Starting Using CBD?<br />Alpha started 7-months ago because he had been suffering from anxiety and working out injuries (specifically plantar fasciitis). Reported benefits of CBD are sleep, anxiety, and inflammation. Alpha believes in nutrition, supplements, vitamins, and the power of the body healing itself. So, he decided to give CBD a try.<br /><br />Alpha’s been using Plant Therapy’s CBD for the past 4-months. They are make sure the quality and purity are there along with transparency. Check out their three sections: FAQs, Proposed Benefits, and Serving Chart. If after you do your research, you won’t go wrong from buying from Plant Therapy.<br /><br />His CBD Journey<br />There are two types of CBD: full spectrum (has THC) and broad spectrum. For months 1 -3, Alpha went broad spectrum and took one dropper nightly. He slept like a rock and woke invigorated. Both the anxiety and plantar fasciitis weren’t affected, however. He started take it twice a day, night and afternoon. He started feeling a calmness daily — feeling better. Something else happened two weeks after taking it twice a day, his plantar fasciitis started to subside. He upped the dosage thereafter, and his foot pain went away completely. He’s on his 4 bottle of Plant Therapy CBD.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />Although he was skeptical going into it, he feels like he has his ‘CBD formula’ and will continue to take it. For him, it’s been beneficial with sleep, anxiety, and body aches. He feels better, and it’s a game-changer for his his overall well-being and health. You need to decide for yourself and be careful with the brand you’re buying.{% endraw %}
