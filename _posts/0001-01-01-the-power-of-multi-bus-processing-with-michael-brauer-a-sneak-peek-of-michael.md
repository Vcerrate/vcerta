{% raw %}A sneak peek of Michael Brauer's 'Inside The Track' series in which he demonstrates the impact of his ABCD mix busses.<br />Full video available exclusively on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mwtm.com/itt11">https://mwtm.com/itt11</a><br /><br />Join us at the prestigious Electric Lady studios in New York to learn from iconic mixer Michael Brauer! In this series of ‘Inside the Track’, we look under the hood of the 2016 rock single ‘This House Is Not for Sale’ by Bon Jovi. Brauer auditions and comments on the high-quality rough mix provided by the producer and guitarist John Shanks, then discusses potential improvements. Using an SSL 9000 J Series console, he reveals his hybrid processing on drums, bass, guitars, piano, pads, and vocals, guides you through his ‘ABCD’ multi-buss template, and shows the parameters of his master chain. He also discusses pre-compression signal levels, automation moves, overall dynamics, artist requests, and more!{% endraw %}
