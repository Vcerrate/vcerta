{% raw %}Even though dogs are known for being innocent, harmless creatures that would make for the best four-legged friends, not all dogs are good for all people. From a wolf killer, and a lion hunter, to one that can literally climb over walls to get to their target, here are ten dog breeds only the brave can handle! <br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ">https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ</a><br /><br />Watch our “12 Rarest Horse Breeds In The World”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/e85-LivRfYQ">https://youtu.be/e85-LivRfYQ</a><br />Watch our “12 Times Animals Saved Human Lives”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/QV2xq1yEPxY">https://youtu.be/QV2xq1yEPxY</a><br />Watch our “12 Times Animals Took Revenge On Cars”<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/3Z_RdzYVLew">https://youtu.be/3Z_RdzYVLew</a><br /><br />Caucasian Shepherd Dog <br /><br />While small dogs can be a little hard to keep up with, there’s no denying the fact that big dogs are a whole other challenge, and the Caucasian Shepherd Dog is one of the biggest ones of them all! On its hind legs, this 30-inch dog can easily match an adult human’s height, but it’s its insanely thick coat that sets them apart. It straight up makes them look like a walking bear! With all that, also comes incredible strength too. They’re so strong that in a lot of parts of the world, they’re called “wolf killers.” <br /><br />That’s because if they want to, they can easily pin down a vicious wolf under their 180-pound weight like they’re just “play fighting”. What’s great about this dog though, is the fact that they’re remarkably intelligent and can recognize their family members. Once they know who their family is, they’ll do anything to protect them. So if anyone gets on their bad side, they’ll get taken down. All of this also means that they’re not the easiest dogs to train, and if you’re not brave enough to be the alpha in the situation, you might find yourself being dragged around by a walking killing machine! <br /><br />Bully Kutta<br /><br />When a dog’s name has the word “Bully” in it, you should know that it’s not going to be an easy ride having one of these around. Bully Kutta is a variation of the bulldog that hails from the India and Pakistan region. These are extremely strong-willed, intense dogs that will do whatever they want unless they’re trained to withhold, and well, let’s just say not everyone is able to do that. For starters, you’re looking at quite a big dog here. <br /><br />The full-grown Bully Kutta is 32 inches tall and weighs around 170 pounds of pure muscle, and they’re not afraid to use all that muscle either. If something ticks them off, they just lunge at it and will attack teeth first! Once they do, they just hold on for dear life and don’t let go, no matter what you try! So if the keeper isn’t brave enough, they don’t stand a chance against this insane dog! <br /><br /><br /><br />Follow Us On Social Media <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► For copyright issues, send us an email at : factsjunkie@gmail.com{% endraw %}
