There are toxic products for women on the market that are unsafe. But, there are also great healthy alternatives for these products that you should check out. <br /><br />Women’s products to avoid:<br />1. Compact powder (talcum powder)<br />This is in many different makeup products and beauty creams. Up to 20% of products that contain talcum powder are contaminated with asbestos. Asbestos can lead to mesothelioma. <br /><br />2. Nail polish and nail polish remover <br />These contain different toxic chemicals that can be absorbed through the nails. These chemicals can lead to central nervous system toxicity and problems with the reproductive organs. Acetone is even on the hazardous substance list and can lead to many different health problems. <br /><br />3. Intimate wash products <br />These contain chemicals that kill your microflora and alter your pH. These products increase your risk of cervical cancer, UTIs, pelvic inflammatory disease, HPV, genital warts, and genital herpes. Try a probiotic for vaginal health instead.<br /><br />4. Hair removal creams <br />Many of these contain an acid that dissolves the keratin in your hair. This acid is on the hazardous substance list. These products can severely irritate or burn your skin. <br /><br />5. Permanent hair dyes <br />There are over 5,000 different chemicals in hair dye, and some of them are known carcinogens. Some of these chemicals may affect your hormones, and some of them are considered endocrine disruptors. Hair dyes may also increase your risk of breast cancer and bladder cancer. <br /><br />ADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description">https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description</a><br /><br />Follow Me On Social Media:<br />Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/FB-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/FB-DrBerg</a><br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/IG-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/IG-DrBerg</a><br />Anchor:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Anchor-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/Anchor-DrBerg</a><br />TikTok:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/TikTok-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/TikTok-DrBerg</a><br /><br />FREE COURSE➜ ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse">http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse</a><br /><br />Talk to a Dr. Berg Keto Consultant today and get the help you need on your journey.

His use of “doctor” or “Dr.” in relation to himself solely refers to that degree.  Dr. Berg is a licensed chiropractor in Virginia, California, and Louisiana, but he no longer practices chiropractic in any state and does not see patients so he can focus on educating people as a full time activity, yet he maintains an active license.

It should not be used to self-diagnose and it is not a substitute for a medical exam, cure, treatment, diagnosis, and prescription or recommendation.  It does not create a doctor-patient relationship between Dr. Berg and you.  You should not make any change in your health regimen or diet before first consulting a physician and obtaining a medical exam, diagnosis, and recommendation.  Always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. <br /><br />#keto #ketodiet #weightloss #ketolifestyle<br /><br />Thanks for watching!
