{% raw %}We got the call from our good friends at Crossroads Powersports in Upper Darby Pa that the new just released 50 cc honda e2 electric bikes were in. We had to go test one out before we took it home. 15 mph and the battery is removable to swap out when it dies if you have an extra. <br /><br />Be sure to SUBSCRIBE <br /><br />INSTAGRAM @oneway_lilman{% endraw %}
