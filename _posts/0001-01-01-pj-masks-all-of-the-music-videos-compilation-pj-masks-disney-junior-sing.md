But when something goes awry in the city, these special kids, filled with curiosity and a sense of justice, get ready for their mission â€“ but they have to wait until nightfall when the city is asleep and they can go undetected. When our heroes get their pyjamas on, and activate their animal amulets, they magically transform into their dynamic super hero alter egos. PJ Masks are on their way - into the night to save the day!<br /><br />#pjmasks #disneyjunior{% endraw %}
