{% raw %}So many of us have the same stories, the same memories. You are right with each passing generation we lose a part of our Italian culture. We must pass our traditions to our children, we must teach them to make homemade pasta and to cook with love, for our families. To be proud of their nationality and to keep the traditions and memories alive. I just recently became an Italian citizen, a gift from my grandfather from the grave. They worked hard and sacrificed so much for us. Please take the time for Sunday dinner with your family make the food with your hands like grandma did. Tell your children stories, they will be proud to be Italian too. I am second generation but my wife still cook all grandma's recipes just like she My mother taught my wife to make homemade wedding soup, ravioli ect. We must not let their traditions disappear. It's the simplest things that bring the greatest pleasures in life. It's all about love, food and respect. We show our love thru the food we make. <br /><br />Buon appetito.<br /><br />This is the Revised Edited and Narrated by Jack Bogut with the original Musical Score by Vito DiSalvo<br /><br />This is a 12- 13 minute audio narrative.<br /><br />I am not the author of this but this is the way it was when I was growing up in Western Pa. and I would like to share it with all of you.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you all very much (Mille Grazie) for watching this Slide Show...If you would like to purchase a CD of the music and the narration only &quot;The Joys of Growing up Italian&quot; (Not the Slide Show) visit the website www.Aspetto.com click on the tab (Italian Music).
