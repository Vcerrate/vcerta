{% raw %}The river water at Kannogawa Campsite is very clean.<br />The sites are also gravel, so there is no need to worry about Ui eating the mud.<br />Ui did not want to swim so much in the Doshi River, but for some reason she really wanted to get in the river here.<br />The Doshi River is also a clean river, but I wonder if the cleaner the river is, the more the otter's desire to swim increases.<br />I was a little bit excited to see Ui swimming so happily.<br /><br />The location of this movie is here (Kannogawa Campsite).<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kannogawa.jp">https://kannogawa.jp</a><br /><br />★Filming equipment<br />GoPro Hero 10 Black, iPhone13 Pro<br /><br />★Membership is now open!
