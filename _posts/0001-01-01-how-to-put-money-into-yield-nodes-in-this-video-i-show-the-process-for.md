{% raw %}In this video, I show the process for depositing money into yield nodes!<br /><br />1.  Create an account with yield nodes <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://yieldnodes.com?a=n7a1rQyEz5Q4emd">https://yieldnodes.com?a=n7a1rQyEz5Q4emd</a><br /><br />2. Generate bitcoin wallet address on yield nodes.<br /><br />3. Buy bitcoin (I showed this on crypto.com but any platform works)<br /><br />4. Send the bitcoin to the yield node address.<br /><br />5. Wait 1 day for the funds to arrive at yield nodes. (Don't freak out if it isn't showing up right away)<br /><br />6. Wait another 7 days for the funds to be added to a master node.<br /><br />7. Enjoy profits!!{% endraw %}
