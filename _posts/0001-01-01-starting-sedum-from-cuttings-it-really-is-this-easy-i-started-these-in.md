If you have some sedum, give it a try.<br /><br />If you would like to be notified when new videos are posted, please subscribe at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/WarLetters">https://www.youtube.com/user/WarLetters</a><br /><br />Home Base Groove by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a> <br /><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100563">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100563</a> <br /><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a> <br /><br /><br />I garden in zone 6b. We have some pretty challenging weather sometimes. I don't claim to be an expert, so you will see my successes and my failures.<br />Although most of my videos are about gardening, I will occasionally post videos about nature, or other things that interest me.<br />I really appreciate feedback, so please say hi so I'll know you've dropped by. <br /> <br />I recently started a page on facebook. It will include photos and some additional information that doesn't show up on youtube. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/midwestgardener">https://www.facebook.com/midwestgardener</a>{% endraw %}
