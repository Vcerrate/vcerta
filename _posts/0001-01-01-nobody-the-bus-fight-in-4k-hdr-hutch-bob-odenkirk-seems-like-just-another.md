As an overlooked and underestimated father and husband, he takes life's indignities on the chin and never rocks the boat. But when his daughter loses her beloved kittycat bracelet in a robbery, Hutch hits a boiling point no one knew he had. What happens when a pushover finally pushes back? Hutch flips from regular dad to fearless fighter by taking his enemies on a wild ride of explosive revenge. The writer of John Wick showcases Emmy® winner Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul) as fans have never seen him before: an average family man who becomes a lethal vigilante unlike any ordinary action hero.<br /><br />© 2020 Universal Studios.
