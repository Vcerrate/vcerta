{% raw %}The Flexibility vs. Usability Tradeoff, or known as the Flexibility/Specialisation Principle, is a rule that states that the more a product can do, the harder it is to learn and use, so developers must be careful in how versatile their product is.<br /><br /><br /><br />For comparison the Nintendo DS and the Sony PSP were chosen, the DS being a specialised piece of gaming hardware, and the PSP likewise but with several extra features added, at the cost of it being more expensive to produce and sometimes harder to use.<br /><br /><br /><br />Vectors were created in Flash and Illustrator then imported into After Effects.<br /><br /><br /><br />Voiced by Robbie Reid.{% endraw %}
