I'm refinishing it with a traditional rust bluing formula, that I took the occasion of sharing with all of you. I'm also explaining how this iconic gun design works, and the challenges of designing a semi-automatic pistol in the last years of the 19th century.<br /><br />*A special thanks goes to Michelangelo Neri Orliani for helping in the making of this project*<br /><br />If you can and want to help me making videos like this, you can directly support me on Patreon:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/backyardballistics">https://www.patreon.com/backyardballistics</a><br /><br />with your help, I can keep making educational content without having to give up my freedom of speech to the advertiser's needs.{% endraw %}
