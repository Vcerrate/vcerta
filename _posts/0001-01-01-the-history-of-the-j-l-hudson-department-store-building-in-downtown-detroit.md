{% raw %}The original J.L. Hudson Department Store was built in downtown Detroit, Michigan in 1891. Needing a larger building, expansion began on the same block. The original location was demolished by 1923 but new construction had started 1911. After twelve separate expansions, the final renovation was finished in 1946 and Hudson took up the entire block. With over 2.1 million square feet and five separate basements, the structure was once the tallest department store in the world and was also once the second largest department store in the United States. Unfortunately, with Detroit declining in the 1960s and beyond, there was a lot of theft in the store and many shoppers avoided downtown due to a lack of safety. Dayton's purchased J.L. Hudson in 1969 and continued to use the building until finally closing on January 17, 1983. The final use of the J.L. Hudson Department Store in Detroit was to house operations and executive employees until they were transferred to Minneapolis, Minnesota by 1986. The building was sold and eventually demolished  on October 24, 1998. #retailrewind<br /><br />Please subscribe and check out more at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://retailrewind.weebly.com/">https://retailrewind.weebly.com/</a>{% endraw %}
