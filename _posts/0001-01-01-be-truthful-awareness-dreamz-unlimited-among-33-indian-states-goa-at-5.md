{% raw %}Among 33 Indian states Goa at 5.48% has one of the slowest growth rates among six other states at 5.48%., the states with lower per capita income include, Andhra Pradesh at 11.83%, Chandigarh at 10.74%, Punjab at 8.79%, Jharkhand at 8.68%, West Bengal at 5.16%, Nagaland at 5.46%, and Puducherry at 4.69%. Six states and union territories have an average growth rate of 8 per cent from 2012-19 fiscal years. Bihar at 9.61%, on the other hand, has the fastest-growing per capita income but is one of the poorest states in India.<br />Letâ€™s not misunderstand per income capital as a source of proving the wealthiness of a state. Goa has the highest per capita income but is not the richest state. Whereas, Maharashtra is the richest state in India while not being one of the top five contributing states of per capita income.<br /><br />Henceforth, the wealthiest state in India is Maharashtra with a GSDP of 32.42 trillion followed by Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan, but the poorest of the states includes Jharkhand, Meghalaya, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh. It is to note that the richest states are inclusive solely of the economy of the particular state, while the poorest states are often defined with the percentage of poverty line and accessibility.{% endraw %}
