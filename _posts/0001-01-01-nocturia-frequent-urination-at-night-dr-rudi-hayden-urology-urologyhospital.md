Causes are varied and can be difficult to discern.[Although not every patient needs treatment, most people seek treatment for severe nocturia, waking up to void more than 2–3 times per night.<br /><br />If you have any concerns regarding any urological problems or symptoms, please get in touch with us at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://urology.co.za/">https://urology.co.za/</a>{% endraw %}
