{% raw %}When you plan a trip, the first thing you search for are tips from other travelers, based on their personal experiences. And when it comes to summer holidays in Greece, it appears that there is one specific thing, most of them agree on: &quot;…once you’re in Greece, you will want to stay forever&quot;.<br /><br />And why is that? Because the unpretentious simplicity of Greece – our friendly locals, the narrow alleys, the picturesque boats, the white houses, the everlasting sun, the endless sea, our traditional flavours … all these may act as a &quot;dangerous&quot; temptation, so intense, that you may never want to leave.<br /><br />#AllYouWantIsGreece #YouWillWanttoStayForever #VisitGreece<br /><br />Credits | Advertising Agency: Ogilvy, Production House: FOSS PRODUCTIONS, Director: Manolis Mavris{% endraw %}
