{% raw %}Welcome Nursing Students! <br />If you just graduated nursing school and have no idea where to begin with studying for the NCLEX, YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE! I felt the same way and I want to help relieve some of your stress and anxiety with going over the big topics that you should know. <br /><br />!!!!NOTE: The ABG question in this video was unclear. I apologize for any inconvenience. I do have a FREE ABG guide with practice questions on my website: beautifulnursing.com that are more clear cut! I really hope you pass the NCLEX! Good luck everyone! <br /><br />This video includes: <br />-Pharmacology<br />-Ob-Maternity<br />-Med Admin<br />-Safety Precautions<br />-PPE<br />-Diabetes<br />-Chest Tubes, Trachs<br />-Lab Values<br />-EKGs<br />And more!!! Enjoy!<br /><br />I did my best to condense all the most important information that I think you should know for your NCLEX into a 1 hr video! Some information and values may differ nationally so please be kind! I hope this helps you! <br /><br />NURSING NOTES: www.Etsy.com/shop/beautifulnursing<br /><br />NCLEX PHARM MEDS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://quizlet.com/558570870/nclex-prep-pharm-flash-cards/">https://quizlet.com/558570870/nclex-prep-pharm-flash-cards/</a><br /><br />FREE nursing school printables and organizers at: www.BeautifulNursing.com<br /><br />Good luck everyone!{% endraw %}
