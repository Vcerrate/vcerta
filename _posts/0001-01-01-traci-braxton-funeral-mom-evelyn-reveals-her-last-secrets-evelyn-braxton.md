{% raw %}Evelyn Braxton, mother of Traci Braxton, is responding to the news about the untimely passing of her daughter, who died from cancer on Saturday March 12th<br /><br />Heading to her Instagram account on Monday she shared a heartfelt post alongside a collage of photos of her late daughter as you will later see them on here.<br /><br />She said,<br /><br />‚ÄúMy dear sweet wonderful, incredible daughter, we slept in the same bed before she became so terminally ill all night talking while sharing so many secrets,‚Äù <br /><br />she began her IG caption, noting that Traci ‚Äúheld on to her determination that she could be an example for someone else‚Äù potentially suffering from the same disease.<br /><br />Braxton recalled Traci telling her, &quot;Mommy, I'm going to beat this! My healing is right around the bend!&quot; to which she told her daughter, &quot;Absolutely oh yes, you will be healed baby girl without a doubt.&quot;<br /><br />The Braxton Family Values star wrote that Traci held on &quot;to her determination&quot; as the weeks and months passed, and said she &quot;never complained&quot; in spite of her illness.<br /><br />&quot;As I watched her every day her mind grew stronger &amp; more determined,&quot; Braxton wrote. <br /><br />‚ÄúShe just knew she was going to get through this, didn't matter how it looked. Life was hers and she was going to have it! I watched the weight drop off. I watched tears streaming down her face as she held onto her faith and her beliefs. She fought a good fight and held on until she could not hold on anymore.&quot;<br /><br />The reality star concluded her sweet message by thanking God for giving her 50 years with Traci, and for &quot;allowing me to be her Mommy.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It will always be an empty place in my heart that will never be fulfilled,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Although she came through me but she comes from God. Yes we will miss her because we love her. Lord, Thank you, you loaned to us such a beautiful treasure in vessel that will never be forgotten.. NO I won't complain! Look at God Forever in my heart!&quot;{% endraw %}
