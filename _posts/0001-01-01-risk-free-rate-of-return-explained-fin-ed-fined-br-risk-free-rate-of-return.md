{% raw %}#fined<br />Risk-free rate of return explained | FIN-Ed<br /><br />Hi, in this video, we will discuss the real risk-free rate and how it is measured using a hypothetical example.<br /><br />The real risk-free rate of interest, which is usual denoted as r*, is the interest rate that would exist on riskless security if no inflation were expected. In other words, the rate of interest on short-term default-free U.S. Treasury security in an inflation-free world is the real risk-free rate. Because there is no such economy as inflation-free, it isn't easy to measure the real rate precisely. Generally speaking, a 3-months US treasury bill is used as the risk-free rate. However, the use of a 10-year US treasury bond as the risk-free rate is not uncommon. It all depends on what purpose it is used for and who the analyst is. The equation that is used to measure interest rate is:<br /><br />Quoted interest rate = r = r*+IP+DRP+LP+MRP<br /><br />Example: <br />You read in The Wall Street Journal that 30-day T-bills are currently yielding 5.8%. Your friend, a broker at Safe and Sound Securities, has given you the following estimates of current interest rate premiums:<br />• Inflation premium = 3.25%<br />• Liquidity premium = 0.6%<br />• Maturity risk premium = 1.85%<br />• Default risk premium = 2.15%<br />On the basis of these data, what is the real risk-free rate of return?<br /><br />Source: Fundamentals of Financial Management (Concise Edition) Brigham and Houston <br />Chapter 6: Interest Rates <br />Problem: 6-2 <br /><br />========Recommended Videos============= <br />Pure Expectations Theory: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/zOeppOAIfD4">https://youtu.be/zOeppOAIfD4</a><br />Default risk premium: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/FSYC5ZIKy0E">https://youtu.be/FSYC5ZIKy0E</a><br />Expected interest rate: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Ujn6-fWYNzs">https://youtu.be/Ujn6-fWYNzs</a><br />======================================== <br /><br />Thanks for watching.....!!!{% endraw %}
