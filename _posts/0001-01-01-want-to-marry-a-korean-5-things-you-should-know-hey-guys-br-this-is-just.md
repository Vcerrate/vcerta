{% raw %}Hey guys ~<br />this is just some of my experience regarding marriage with a Korean while living in Korea.  My husband has pretty much lived in Korea his whole life, whereas I grew up in the States most of my life. My wedding was in Korea, and therefore, a lot of the preparation was Korean style or Korean tradition.  <br /><br />I am just talking about my experience. Hope this helps. I{% endraw %}
