{% raw %}Kerbside Collection - Round The Corner (2022)<br />(J Bell, L Symons, A Fincher)<br /><br />⥰  Digi single available on all platforms:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lnk.to/l0o9sl">https://lnk.to/l0o9sl</a><br /><br />Australian ‘down-under’ dusty jazzfunk and gritty rare grooves ensemble ‘Kerbside Collection’ <br />return on their 4th studio album (written and constructed during the last 12-18 months of the <br />cv-19 climate), following the first taste of the lush &amp; laidback ‘Glaze’, with the second single (and album title) ‘Round The Corner’. Referring to some of the ‘unknowns’ and ‘uncertainties’ around the corner post cv-19, it’s also an uplifting groove affirmation looking forward to the positive things, and seasons to come round these kinds of unknown corners, and the incoming new year. <br /><br /><br /><br />In contrast to the cruisy, layered and cinematic first single, ‘Round The Corner’ is a tight, dancy, uptempo, jazz-funk-fusion burner featuring the group’s core trio raw and upfront. The Rubbery, pulsating electric bass guitar of Lachlan 'swampdog' Symons, the silky Fender Rhodes (and acoustic piano solo) + jazzy guitar of Andrew 'manny' Fincher, and the gritty, razor sharp grooves and percussion of drummer Paprika, are all wrapped up into this dance-floor friendly, contemporary live jazzfunk track!<br /><br /> <br /><br />‘Round The Corner’ embodies little touches of the current resurgence of live jazz-house crossover sounds coming out of Australia (Beatnik Collective, Horatio Luna, First Beige etc), whilst also reminding us of acid jazz music from people like Incognito, The Rebirth and Herbie Hancock’s 70’s jazz fusion years. <br /> Another sumptuous taste of what to expect on this special new record from ‘down-under’ <br />out in 2022 on modern funk and soul label Légère Recordings.<br /><br /><br /><br />Digi single out 21st January 2022<br />full length ‘Round the Corner’ album &amp; LP package <br />out 18th  February 2022.<br /><br />visuals: Gina Tratt<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ginatratt.com">https://ginatratt.com</a><br /><br />Fender rhodes / Piano / Guitar - Andrew 'manny' Fincher<br />Electric Bass - Lachlan 'swampdog' Symons<br />Drums / Percussion - Paprika<br />Recorded by Marly Lüske @ Alchemix Bne/Au Jan 24th 2021.<br /><br />℗ Mr Mellow’s Music Publishing (Hamburg/Germany)<br /><br />follow Kerbside Collection<br />⥰ Spotify <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6OOY4mJJDFE32QIWK171zh">https://open.spotify.com/artist/6OOY4mJJDFE32QIWK171zh</a><br />⥰ Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kerbsidecollection_/">https://www.instagram.com/kerbsidecollection_/</a><br />⥰ Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/KerbsideCollection">https://www.facebook.com/KerbsideCollection</a><br />⥰ Bandcamp <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kerbsidecollection.bandcamp.com/">https://kerbsidecollection.bandcamp.com/</a><br />⥰ Soundcloud <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/kerbside-collection">https://soundcloud.com/kerbside-collection</a><br />⥰ Youtube <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/KerbsideCollection">https://www.youtube.com/c/KerbsideCollection</a><br /><br />follow Légère Recordings<br />⥰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://legererecordings.bandcamp.com/">https://legererecordings.bandcamp.com/</a><br />⥰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/legere.recordings">https://www.facebook.com/legere.recordings</a><br />⥰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/legere_recordings/">https://www.instagram.com/legere_recordings/</a>{% endraw %}
