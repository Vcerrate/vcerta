{% raw %}• • Do you want to be a PAID teacher while working on your teaching certificate?  It's true; you can!<br /><br />With your education certification, you'll find more job opportunities and better pay. There are a lot of options available.  I even found a FREE master's degree!<br /><br />With many alternative certificate programs, you can be a **PAID** teacher (with benefits!) while working through the program.
