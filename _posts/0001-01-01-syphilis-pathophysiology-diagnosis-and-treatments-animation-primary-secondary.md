Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.<br />Syphilis is a bacterial infection caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum, and is considered a sexually-transmitted disease (STD). Syphilis is readily treatable with penicillin, but if left untreated, it may cause severe damage to most bodily organs and can be life-threatening. Syphilis is known as “the great imitator”, as it mimics a large number of different conditions. Syphilis patients are at increased risk of contracting HIV.<br />Syphilis develops in 3 symptomatic stages: primary, secondary and tertiary, which are typically separated by periods of no symptoms. There is also a prominent latent phase in between secondary and tertiary syphilis.{% endraw %}
