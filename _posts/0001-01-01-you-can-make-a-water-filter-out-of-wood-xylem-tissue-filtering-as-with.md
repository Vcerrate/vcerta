{% raw %}As with anything, I always like to find ways around or alternative ways to do something.  While charcoal filters and artificial membrane filters are indeed amazing traditional ways to filter water, I wanted to see if there was any other alternatives worth exploring.  Enter the Xylem filter.  Now the Xylem tissue of a tree is what carries water, sap, and nutrients up and down a tree.  The theory being trees can absorb dirty water from the roots and put purified water into its fruits and sap.  There was research done by MIT to see if this type of filter is doable and they found it to be successful.  I wanted to see if this type of filter was better than the traditional Charcoal filter.  So this video is my experimenting with the flow and taste of the filtered liquids.<br /><br />MIT article that gave me this whole idea:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://news.mit.edu/2014/need-a-water-filter-peel-a-tree-branch-0226">http://news.mit.edu/2014/need-a-water-filter-peel-a-tree-branch-0226</a><br /><br />#Waterfilter<br />#SelfReliance<br />#PalmettoPrepared{% endraw %}
