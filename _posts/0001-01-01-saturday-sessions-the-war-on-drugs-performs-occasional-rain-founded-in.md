{% raw %}Founded in Philadelphia in 2008, The War on Drugs were an underground favorite — until they hit it big with their 2014 album, leading to critical acclaim and sold-out tours. Now, the band is preparing for a worldwide tour in January. For Saturday sessions, The War on Drugs performs &quot;Occasional Rain.&quot;<br /><br />“CBS Saturday Morning” co-hosts Jeff Glor, Michelle Miller and Dana Jacobson deliver two hours of original reporting and breaking news, as well as profiles of leading figures in culture and the arts. <br /><br />Subscribe to “CBS Mornings” on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/CBSMornings">https://www.youtube.com/CBSMornings</a> <br />Watch CBSN live: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cbsn.ws/1PlLpZ7c​">http://cbsn.ws/1PlLpZ7c​</a><br />Download the CBS News app: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cbsn.ws/1Xb1WC8​">http://cbsn.ws/1Xb1WC8​</a><br />Follow &quot;CBS Mornings&quot; on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3A13OqA">https://bit.ly/3A13OqA</a><br />Like &quot;CBS Mornings&quot; on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3tpOx00">https://bit.ly/3tpOx00</a><br />Follow &quot;CBS Mornings&quot; on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/38QQp8B">https://bit.ly/38QQp8B</a><br />Subscribe to our newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cbsn.ws/1RqHw7T​">http://cbsn.ws/1RqHw7T​</a><br />Try Paramount+ free: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2OiW1kZ">https://bit.ly/2OiW1kZ</a><br /><br />For video licensing inquiries, contact: licensing@veritone.com{% endraw %}
