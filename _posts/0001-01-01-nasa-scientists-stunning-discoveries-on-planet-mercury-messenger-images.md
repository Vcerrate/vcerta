Which is one of the reasons why in all of human history, there have only ever been 2 missions to Mercury, with just one more on the way. Mariner 10 in 1974, MESSENGER in 2011 and BepiColombo due to arrive in 2025. Of these prior two missions, only MESSENGER went into orbit around Mercury, and so it is the only mission to ever give us close up shots of Mercury’s surface. And crazily enough, some of the formations we’ve seen on the surface are still unsolved mysteries even more than a decade on, while other formations give us hints at the raw primal power of the early solar system.{% endraw %}
