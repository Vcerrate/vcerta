{% raw %}This week I'm joined by Rif Hutton.  You may know Rif best from his recent work as Lenny Caulfield on General Hospital, but Rif has had an extensive voice-over career and has also appeared on other television series such as Doogie Howser, M.D., JAG Star Trek: Generations along with other film work.<br /><br />Rif tells me what it was like living with parents who both had undiagnosed mental illness and overcoming adversity while pursuing his dream of acting. We talk about General Hospital and what working together meant for each of us.<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mauricebenard/">https://www.instagram.com/mauricebenard/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mauricebenard">https://twitter.com/mauricebenard</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MauriceBenard/">https://www.facebook.com/MauriceBenard/</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mbstateofmind/">https://www.instagram.com/mbstateofmind/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mbstateofmind">https://twitter.com/mbstateofmind</a><br />Learn more about State Of Mind at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mbstateofmind.com.">https://www.mbstateofmind.com.</a><br /><br />If you'd like to learn more about my life, I've recently released &quot;Nothing General About It - How Love (and Lithium) Saved Me On and Off General Hospital&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062973371?tag=harpercollinsus-20">https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062973371?tag=harpercollinsus-20</a>{% endraw %}
