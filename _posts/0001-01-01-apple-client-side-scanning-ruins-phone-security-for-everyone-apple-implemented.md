{% raw %}Apple implemented a hash based Client-Side scanning of images on iPhones last year. The purported reason is to catch those with illegal images. Now here we are a year later with unintended consequences for this very bad decision. Well, not a bad decision for Intelligence agencies. But very bad for all the users of any Apple or even potentially Google phones.<br /><br />Understand the implications of this. Apple cannot take this technology back. Since it's been revealed to governments that it was completed, then all governments have to do is demand access. And we will never know if anything is happening quietly.<br /><br />Bruce Schneier Take on Client-Side Scanning<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/10/security-risks-of-client-side-scanning.html">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/10/security-risks-of-client-side-scanning.html</a><br /><br />Oh, are you enjoying those Airtags?<br /><br />Merch Store (See the de-Googled shirt I was wearing)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://my-store-c37a50.creator-spring.com/">https://my-store-c37a50.creator-spring.com/</a><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />I'm the Internet Privacy Guy. I'm a public interest technologist. I'm here to educate. You are losing your Internet privacy and Internet security every day if you don't fight for it. Your data is collected with endless permanent data mining. Learn about a TOR router, a VPN , antivirus, spyware, firewalls, IP address, wifi triangulation, data privacy regulation, backups and tech tools, and evading mass surveillance from NSA, CIA, FBI. Learn how to be anonymous on the Internet so you are not profiled. Learn to speak freely with pseudo anonymity. Learn more about the dangers of the inernet and the dangers of social media, dangers of email.<br /><br /><br />I like alternative communication technology like Amateur Radio and data communications using Analog.
