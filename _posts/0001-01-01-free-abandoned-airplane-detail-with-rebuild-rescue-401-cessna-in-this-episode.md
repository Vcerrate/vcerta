{% raw %}In this episode, I was invited down to PA to detail a free abandoned 1969 Cessna 401 Phoenix Airplane found by my friends at Rebuild Rescue in an airport parking lot. The owner gave him this airplane for FREE, so he now needs to detail and restore the interior, polish the paint, and overhaul the engines to get it flying again. Inside is a complete disaster as mice, birds, and wasps have infested the cabin, and used it as a disgusting toilet. Years of poop have destroyed the seats, carpets, and walls of the interior cabin. I clean the interior with AMMO Lather, scrub pad, drill brush, steam machine, steam vac, tons of towels and lots of gagging. When I was done, I Disinfected the cabin using the ALL NEW AMMO RESTOR, which has been approved by the EPA!
