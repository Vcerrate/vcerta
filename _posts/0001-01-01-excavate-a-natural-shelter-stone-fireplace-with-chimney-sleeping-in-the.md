{% raw %}The video is about an overnight stay deep in the wilderness<br />I found a gigantic stone as accommodation and half dug it under tunter and slept there. For the heat, I built a stone fireplace with a chimney so that the night is warm!<br />If it would rain I would use a tarp tent to cover the nature shelter<br />To eat I grilled 1 kilo steak.<br /><br /><br />I want to be a part of nature, not a spectator who just comes to visit. Not a tourist because we are all tourists in nature. People visit nature but are not part of it. Being a part of nature means being completely naked, without modern technology, with nothing, a true human animal in the wild. We have lost our ability to live like this in nature, so we have to apply technologies that make us tourists in nature. But if we relearn old skills, we can go out into nature and become one with that environment, a part of it. Only then will we become human again!<br /><br />Subscribe to my channel so that you wont miss any adventures of me!<br /><br />Have fun by watching!<br /><br />Follow me on<br />Insagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bushcraft.gr/?hl=el">https://www.instagram.com/bushcraft.gr/?hl=el</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/dinos.d.b">https://www.facebook.com/dinos.d.b</a><br />Twitter:      <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BushcraftGr">https://twitter.com/BushcraftGr</a><br /><br />Mailbox for my fans:<br />BUSHCRAFT GR<br />P.O.
