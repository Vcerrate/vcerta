{% raw %}We are coming off of an enormously difficult two years as educators where the pandemic pushed us to our limits. Although it was stressful and challenging, we learned so much about ourselves. We are capable of more than we imagined. <br /><br />In honor of teacher appreciation week, Dr. Eib would like to thank everyone at CLIU for their tireless work during one of the worst eras in modern history. We look forward to continuing the mission of helping children learn.<br /><br />#helpingchildrenlearn{% endraw %}
