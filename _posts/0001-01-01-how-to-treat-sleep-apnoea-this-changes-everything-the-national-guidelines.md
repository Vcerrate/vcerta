{% raw %}The National guidelines for treating people with sleep apnoea have dropped and so much has changed.  In some cases surgery should now be offered before CPAP.  I explain how the new National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines have changed how we treat sleep apnoea in this country forever.  For many years our team has lobbied the NICE committee to make these changes and finally we have some modern guidelines to treat people with.  This is great for the NHS and all those with sleep apnoea.<br /><br />NEWSLETTER<br />If you would like more information, news and have access to various devices I give away for free, please sign up to my Newsletter.

They aren't for sale yet, but once I have a few I will put them on the blockchain.  All profits will be donated to charities.  This first one is about plastic in the sea, and I will find a charity that will accept a crypto donation.  I will also make a video one day explaining the benefits of NFTs.  It also gives me a chance to flex some artistic brain cells I haven't used in many many years. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/56498520906410650706976433047475304378937764116199428096899550537262447984641/">https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/56498520906410650706976433047475304378937764116199428096899550537262447984641/</a><br /><br /><br />** Disclaimer - The information in this video is not intended nor implied to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.
