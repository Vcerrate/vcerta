{% raw %}Last minute! A clear threat from Russia to England: This will have an answer!<br /><br />The Russian Ministry of Defense has made it clear that if the weapons supplied by Britain to Ukraine are used to attack targets in Russia, the decision-making centers in Kiev will be hit.<br /><br />In the statement made by the ministry, it was reminded that the British Secretary of State for Defense James Heappey said that &quot;it would not be a problem&quot; to attack targets on Russian soil with weapons supplied to Ukraine.<br /><br />In the statement, it was stated that the Russian army was ready for 24 hours to launch retaliatory attacks on the decision-making centers in Kiev with long-range high-precision guided missiles.<br /><br />&quot;We want to emphasize that London's direct provocation of the Kyiv regime to such actions will prompt our immediate proportional response if it is attempted to be carried out. The presence of advisers, who are citizens of any of the Western countries, at the Ukrainian decision-making centers in Kiev, reflects Russia's decision on its response. It won't be a problem.&quot;<br /><br />British Secretary of State for Defense James Heappey, when asked about the news that Ukraine targeted a fuel tank on Russian soil, used the following statements:<br /><br />&quot;The question is, is it acceptable to use our weapons systems by Ukrainians against legitimate Russian military targets? First of all, it's the Ukrainians, not the manufacturers or exporters of military equipment, who make the targeting decision in the first place. Second, it's perfectly legitimate to go after targets deep inside your competitors to disrupt their logistics and supply lines. &quot;{% endraw %}
