{% raw %}Hi, I'm Dr. Jarrod Long and I practice low vision care in south-central Indiana and see patients from around the world.  As a low vision doctor there are many ways that I can help a variety of patients with vision loss.  This video features special Side Vision Awareness Glasses that can help patients struggling to function due to partial or complete vision loss in both eyes to one side of their visual field.  This condition sometimes occurs with a stroke or brain injury.<br /><br />Contact Information for Dr. Long and Midwest Low Vision:<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://midwestlowvision.com/">https://midwestlowvision.com/</a><br />Email: drlong@midwestlowvision.com<br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/midwest-low-vision">https://www.linkedin.com/company/midwest-low-vision</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/drjarrodlong">https://www.facebook.com/drjarrodlong</a><br />Toll-free phone:  1-877-577-2040<br />Address:<br />  Walter Jarrod Long, OD<br />  Midwest Low Vision<br />  660 S.
