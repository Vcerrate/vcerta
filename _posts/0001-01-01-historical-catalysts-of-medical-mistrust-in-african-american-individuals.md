The first news article discusses a study on the lack of racial diversity in cell lines utilized within medical research such as breast, prostate, and cervical cancer, (Hooker Jr., 2019). The second news article discusses multiple different studies that determine the correlation between medical mistrust and ethnicity. <br /><br />This video was made by McMaster students Lovejot Mangat, Madison Hunter, Samuel Park, and Areesha Saeed.  <br /> <br />Copyright McMaster University 2021.  <br /><br />References <br />Alpers, L.-M.
