{% raw %}Business Psychologist Andrew Sillitoe explores why some people rise to the top 20% in their field starting with research into why young people stay engaged with sport throughout their teens. Engaging others to operate at their full potential may be less of a mystery than we think – listen to Andrew’s story about what he learnt on the road playing street hockey and what it takes to create a high performance culture.<br /><br /><br /><br />All TEDxRoyalTunbridgeWells videos recorded by Graham Hobbs, Clockhouse Productions. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.clockhouse.co.uk/">http://www.clockhouse.co.uk/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />When Andrew Sillitoe was 9 his mum bought him a street hockey stick. An unusual gift for an English boy living in the South East of England, but in that moment, his life would never be the same. He is now one of the most recognisable names in the inline hockey scene, both as a player and coach.<br /><br /><br /><br />Andrew studied an MSc in Organisational Psychology from Birkbeck University. He wrote his first book Managing the Mist How to develop winning mind-sets and create high performing teams in 2013.<br /><br /><br /><br />Andrew helps organisations achieve commercial success by creating teams with purpose. He passionately believes that a team with purpose is more innovative, diverse and agile to any organisation.<br /><br /><br /><br />He lives in Royal Tunbridge Wells with his wife Lucie and their two daughters Izzie and Freya.<br /><br /><br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
