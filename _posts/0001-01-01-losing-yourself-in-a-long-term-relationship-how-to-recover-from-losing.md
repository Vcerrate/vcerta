{% raw %}How to recover from losing yourself in a long term relationship to regain attraction and intimacy.<br /><br />In this video coaching newsletter I discuss an email from a viewer who says he lost himself in his long term relationship. His father died a year ago and he lost his center, started acting needy and treating his girlfriend like his mommy and therapist. She eventually got turned off and told him to get his act together. He mostly has, but his relationship still has not recovered. He is acting needy and smothering her now that her attraction has dropped.<br /><br />“Masculinity is calm, relaxed, playful and unperturbable. Men in their masculine who appear to be able to handle anything life throws at them, make their women feel safe and comfortable enough to be extremely feminine and submissive. Men who are quick to anger and easy to perturb make women feel unsafe and cause them to become more masculine and less romantically attracted to them. Never make your woman your mommy or your therapist unless you want her to lose respect and attraction for you.” ~ Coach Corey Wayne <br /><br />If you have not read my book, “How To Be A 3% Man” yet, that would be a good starting place for you.
