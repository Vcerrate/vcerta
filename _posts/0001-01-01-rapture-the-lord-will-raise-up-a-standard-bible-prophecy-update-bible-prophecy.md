{% raw %}Bible Prophecy Update w/ Dr. Bruce Ruisi: &quot;RAPTURE: The Lord Will &quot;RAISE UP⬆&quot; a Standard&quot;.  In the days of Noah, God &quot;raised up&quot; the ark against the flood.  In the days of the Exodus, God &quot;raised up&quot; the waters of the red sea against Pharaoh and his armies.  In this final generation, God will once again &quot;raise up&quot; a standard for the believer against the fast approaching great tribulation.  In today's End Times For The Believer bible prophecy update, Dr. Bruce Ruisi discusses in detail &quot;this standard that God is raising up&quot; against the enemy in these final moments of the church age.  Yes, the flood of iniquity is upon us.  Yes, the flood of tribulation is just before us.  But God tells us, &quot;when the enemy comes in like a flood, God will raise up a standard against him.”   <br /><br />➡➡➡If this ministry has become a blessing to you and you would like to help support Sheepsong Ministries financially, please click the below link to make a tax-deductible donation.  100% of contributions goes directly into the ministry to continue &quot;reaching the ones among the 99&quot; with the message of the cross.  <br /><br />➡➡➡SECURE DONATION LINK  ❤️️: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/sheepsongministries">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/sheepsongministries</a> <br /><br />➡➡➡ STAY CONNECTED WITH US ❤️️:<br />@Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/sheepsongministries">https://www.facebook.com/sheepsongministries</a> <br />@YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/sheepsongministries">https://www.youtube.com/sheepsongministries</a> <br />@Rumble: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rumble.com/sheepsongministries">https://www.rumble.com/sheepsongministries</a>  <br /><br /><br />➡➡➡WHAT IS END TIMES FOR THE BELIEVER? <br />It is a weekly end times bible prophecy update led by Dr. Bruce Ruisi of Sheepsong Ministries that is designed to equip the believer with a hopeful perspective of the end times.  Many Christians relate bible prophecy to &quot;doom and gloom&quot;, and for the unbeliever, this may be true.  But for the believer, this is the most exciting time to be alive.  God chose us to be present for this final generation, and for good reason.  We are to fight the good fight of faith, and lead as many to the cross as we can before the judgement falls upon the world. <br /><br />➡➡➡WHO IS SHEEP|SONG MINISTRIES?<br />Luke 15, “reaching the one’s among the 99” is our mission.
