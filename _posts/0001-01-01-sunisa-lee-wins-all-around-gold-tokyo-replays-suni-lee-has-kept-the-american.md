{% raw %}Suni Lee has kept the American streak alive. Coming into these Games, an American woman has won the women's gymnastics all-around title in each of the last five Olympic Games.<br /><br />She totaled 57.433 for gold, holding off Brazil's Rebeca Andrade (57.298) and ROC's Angelina Melnikova (57.199). Lee joins U.S. greats Mary Lou Retton (1984), Carly Patterson (2004), Nastia Liukin (2008), Gabby Douglas (2012) and Simone Biles (2016) as the only U.S. women to win the all-around title at the Olympic Games. Lee is the first Hmong American gymnast.<br /><br />Andrade's medal is the first for a South American woman in the women's all-around final. Prior to Thursday, the best finish by a Brazilian woman was Jade Barbosa's 10th place finish in 2008. _____________________________________________________<br />👉 News from the Olympic world: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oly.ch/Home">https://oly.ch/Home</a><br />🔔 Subscribe &amp; hit the bell: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oly.ch/SubscribeGym">https://oly.ch/SubscribeGym</a><br />📺 Exclusive documentaries: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oly.ch/Channel">https://oly.ch/Channel</a><br />🏃‍♀️ Replays from #Tokyo2020: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oly.ch/Replays">https://oly.ch/Replays</a>{% endraw %}
