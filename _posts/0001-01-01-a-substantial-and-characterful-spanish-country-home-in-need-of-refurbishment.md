{% raw %}FANTASTIC FINCA !! - This substantial and charming farmhouse residence is found within beautiful countryside surroundings, located within just 4.7 km from the town of Montforte del Cid, 24 km from the city of Alicante, and within a 20 minute drive of Alicante international airport. The house is set within a fully fenced, flat and extensive grounds (4,549 m2) which offer a private swimming pool (9m x 4m), an orchard, plus an internal courtyard perfect for hosting parties / creation of private gardens.   <br /><br />The house was constructed in 1900 and the original features have been retained. It is arranged over ground and first floors with the majority of the bedrooms being arranged over first floor level. The property currently provides 7 bedrooms, although there are further rooms that can be converted into bedrooms if required, including an independent guest suite with independent access. It lends itself perfectly to being converted into a small boutique hotel / countryside guest house. It needs further renovation and refurbishment but this is reflected in the asking price.{% endraw %}
