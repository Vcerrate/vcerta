{% raw %}This vertically scrolling shmup is also known as &quot;Tatsujin&quot;, which means &quot;expert player&quot; or something similar-- fitting; since this game is difficult!  Perhaps not so much in the sense that it's bullet hell like later shooters like ARMED POLICE BATRIDER, but it's still really hard due to lots of bullets and some fast bullets/lasers that are tough to avoid.  Even with the daunting difficulty it's a more than respectable shooter with its unique power up system and very cool weapons.  In order to upgrade a weapon you must collect 5 P icons (usually in shmups you get a power up right away when you collect one), and the 5th will have a red border around it indicating you will get the power upgrade.  The weapons are but 3: Orange Power Shot (spread), -- and the Orange shot is your default and it's 3-way.. yes, you start the game with a 3 way shot!  Also, you can collect the Green Truxton Beam, which is the strongest shot, and the cool but weak Blue Thunder Laser which you can HOLD DOWN for a constant laser shot that also homes in on tougher enemies.  Still useful to have when your fingers get tired from constantly firing with the other weapons.  Anyway, all 3 weapons upgrade a maximum of twice, with 3 times the firepower of the initial weapon and the final upgrades adds to the firepower with 2 option fighters with you (you can't lose them unless you die).  Loss of a life will lose your upgrade but the amount of P icons-- up to 4-- that you collected will be intact.  TRUXTON is highly regarded by shmup fans from the 80s, and warranted a good Genesis port and sequel: TRUXTON II.  Created by shmup mavens Toaplan and also licensed to Taito and Midway.{% endraw %}
