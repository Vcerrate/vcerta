BOX  383304<br />Germantown, TN 38183-3304<br /><br />thecountrycouponer.com@gmail.com<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question 🙋‍♀️ You told me “don’t ask Employees about Penny Items” <br />That just means Do your homework 📄 be prepared, have a list and check the prices before you check out…. Don’t bug overworked employees and make his /her job harder <br /><br />So definitely don’t say anything not at first, because you don’t want to give the manager a reason to pull the Penny items before you go and pull them yourself, but employees are not stupid they know exactly what you’re doing… after you go and look for all the penny items and the employees are in a good mood and they are approachable, it’s not that big of a deal….. on the other hand if they’re not in a good mood and they do not like Penny Shoper‘s they can drastically affect the outcome of you Penny shopping at that location. You have to be able to look at their body language and read people and see if they are approachable, and how they feel about Penny shopping in general.{% endraw %}
