{% raw %}Honestly he’ll kill me for even writing that title 😅😅. My husband is a very low key guy. He does NOT like the spotlight 😬. LOL maybe thats one of the reasons were such a great team? We bring out the best in each other, and each of us takes turns “ taking the wheel” depending on our strengths. After 22 years of marriage I can absolutely confirm that commitment is NOT about “completing” each other, but rather “complimenting” each other. ❤️❤️❤️ Thank you A-List Showroom for the invite!!{% endraw %}
