{% raw %}How to pronounce 100 brand names in British and American English. Many people mispronounce brands when they speak English. It's logical because some brand names don't follow typical pronunciation rules. Plus it's not always clear how to anglicise foreign names.<br /><br />In this video I give you the English pronunciations of 100 well-known brands. For foreign brands, where possible, I also give you the original pronunciation. I prefer not to give the original pronunciation if I don't speak the language at all, because I don't want to risk saying it incorrectly. I speak French, German, Spanish and some Italian.<br /><br />#englishwithmax #englishpronunciation #advancedenglish #learnenglish #englishteacher #brandnames #pronunciation ðŸ”¹<br /><br /><br /><br />ðŸŽˆ Discount on ADVANCED VOCABULARY Course:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/toefl-words-advanced-english-vocabulary/?couponCode=GEORGEFEB22">https://www.udemy.com/course/toefl-words-advanced-english-vocabulary/?couponCode=GEORGEFEB22</a><br /><br /><br />ðŸŽˆ Discount on COMMON MISTAKES Course:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/perfectyourenglish/?couponCode=FRANKFEB22">https://www.udemy.com/course/perfectyourenglish/?couponCode=FRANKFEB22</a><br /><br /><br />ðŸŽˆ FREE advanced English email lessons every two weeks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://englishwithmax.com/free-email-lessons/">https://englishwithmax.com/free-email-lessons/</a><br /><br /><br />ðŸŽˆ Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://englishwithmax.com/">https://englishwithmax.com/</a><br /><br /><br />SOCIAL MEDIA:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/englishwithmax/">https://www.instagram.com/englishwithmax/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/EnglishWithMax/">https://www.facebook.com/EnglishWithMax/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EnglishWithMax">https://twitter.com/EnglishWithMax</a>{% endraw %}
