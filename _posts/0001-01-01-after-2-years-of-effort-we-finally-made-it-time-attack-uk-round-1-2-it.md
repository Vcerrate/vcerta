{% raw %}It feels surreal to actually be uploading this video. Ever since I strapped a turbo to my first MX5, I knew that Time Attack is where I wanted to end up. We might not be there in the car we intended (yet) but to be on track competing in a car that I own is a very special feeling.<br /><br />If you enjoy the video then please hit that like button!<br /><br />Help support the channel over on my Patreon page - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/jimmybroadbent">https://www.patreon.com/jimmybroadbent</a><br /><br />Twitch - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/jimmy_broadbent">https://www.twitch.tv/jimmy_broadbent</a><br />Business Enquiries - jimmy@coderedesports.com<br />Discord - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/HKw9Vtqdf6">https://discord.gg/HKw9Vtqdf6</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JimmyBroadbent">https://twitter.com/JimmyBroadbent</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/jimmerinoBombino/">https://www.facebook.com/jimmerinoBombino/</a><br /><br />Most the music on this channel comes from the very talented Amphobious.
