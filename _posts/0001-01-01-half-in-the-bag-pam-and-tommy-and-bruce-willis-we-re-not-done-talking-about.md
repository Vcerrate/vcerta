{% raw %}We're not done talking about Bruce Willis movies! For some reason. Or more specifically, for no reason. There's been two more terrible Bruce Willis movies in just the month since our previous Bruce Willis video so we wanted to get caught up. Also discussed: the Hulu series Pam and Tommy, a good show that you probably don't care about.{% endraw %}
