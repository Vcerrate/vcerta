{% raw %}In this video I will show you a simple solution that I came up with so that I could advertise on my pages again. Make sure to subscribe to this page.  And to check out my training courses at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://entrepreneursuccessuniversity.com">https://entrepreneursuccessuniversity.com</a><br /><br /><br />So back in May my Facebook Ad account became permanently restricted due to Ad quality.  Well watch this video to see what I did to begin advertising on my pages again.  I was so distraught when this happened to me. It took me a couple of months to figure out how to advertise again.  My Facebook Ad Account was Permanently Restricted.  In this video I explain what I did and maybe this can help you.  Leave a comment below to let me know if this helps.
