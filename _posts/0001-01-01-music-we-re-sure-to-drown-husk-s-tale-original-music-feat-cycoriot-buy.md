{% raw %}BUY/STREAM THE SONG:<br />Bandcamp: Coming Soon<br />iTunes: Coming Soon<br />Spotify: Coming Soon<br />Apple Music: Coming Soon<br /><br />A brand new original song based around Husk, featuring originally created backing music, sound design, voice acted story and artwork.<br /><br />This one is quite the departure from my previous song writing exercises, not only because of the genre this song is focused on, but due to the character choice being one of the hardest voices for me to imitate and expand upon. Husk is a character who has very little known about him in terms of actual canon, yet his potential as one of the hardest cases for the hotel to crack is very strong through how he conducts himself caring and feeling very little about his predicament and others around him.<br /><br />The song itself is an attempt to capitalise on that potential, framed around the storytelling device of Charlie attempting to use her position as the hotel's manager to help Husk explain more of his situation and how he came to be under Alastor's employ. But Husk's answer is less in relevance to himself and more to act as a warning to her: that many others like him have already accepted that they were sent to Hell for a reason and that their issues aren't as simple as &quot;behaving better&quot; in order to earn their redemption.<br /><br />To that end, having the incredible vocal talents of Cycoriot to play the role of Charlie in this song was a dream come true. Able to be a natural mimic towards a lot of the female cast of Hazbin through their own work as part of dubbing groups and being a fantastic artist in their own right, their aid in both singing and helping with the writing of these characters in the lyrics was such a treat to assemble and I look forward to showing you more of what we're making together.<br /><br />And finally, a gigantic thank to the also immensely talented NinjaHaku21Art for providing two amazing pieces of artwork to use in the song. After seeing a lot of their brilliant merch designs for multiple fandoms and the fan pieces they had made based on my other original songs, I was very pleased to ask them to come aboard to help with creating the detailed art you can see here.
