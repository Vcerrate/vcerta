{% raw %}A love story that has bewitched audiences and critics worldwide, Mademoiselle Chambon is an &quot;exquisite chamber piece&quot; (LA Times) that delicately captures the initial stirrings of romance.<br /><br /><br /><br />Vincent Lindon plays Jean, a burly and happily married housing contractor. One fateful afternoon, he picks up his son (Arthur Le Houérou) from school and meets the teacher, a willowy beauty named Mademoiselle<br /><br />Chambon (Sandrine Kiberlain). Their flirtation slowly builds over lingering glances and an impromptu violin solo in Chambon's apartment. Like the classical music they swoon over, their relationship builds through subtle<br /><br />movements: the tilt of a head, or an inadvertent brush of the cheek, fills their hearts with longing. Jean soon comes to a crossroads, having to choose<br /><br />between the intensity of his bond with Chambon or the responsibility and<br /><br />care he feels for his wife (Aure Atika) and child.<br /><br /><br /><br />A &quot;beautifully observed&quot; (NY Magazine) evocation of what it feels like to fall dizzyingly in love, Mademoiselle Chambon won the Cesar (the French Oscar) for best Adapted Screenplay, and is an unqualified triumph for<br /><br />director Stéphane Brizé.{% endraw %}
