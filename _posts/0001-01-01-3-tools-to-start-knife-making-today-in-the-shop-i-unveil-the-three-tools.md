{% raw %}Today in the shop I unveil the three tools that I think are most important for those of you who want to get into knife making. These three tools will let you build a quality knife that looks good, works well, and holds an edge.<br /><br />The 4 1/2&quot; Angle grinder allows you to cut and shape your steel, the 1x30 Belt Grinder lets you finish that shape, and grind your bevels, as well as shape your handle material. Lastly the Propane Torch enables you to heat treat your steel. The heat treat is by far the most important part of a good knife, so make sure that you are using known steels, and heat treating your knife the ways recommended for the steel you are using. <br /><br />As always, there are of course cheaper versions of each of these tools, including files, a Dremel or rotary tool, a hack saw, and a fire pit/hair dryer combo, but for about $100, these three tools will get you started much easier and more successfully into knife making. Like wise, there are more expensive and sophisticated versions of each of these, including a metal cutting band saw, a 2x72 belt grinder, and a forge or heat treating oven. These will give you more control over your knife making and step you up to the professional level, but are going to cost you much more. <br /><br />The most important part is just getting started. If you do not have the funds to get the tools I have suggested, make a knife how ever you can. The creation of a knife is a skill that goes back as far as human kind, and there is a great sense of accomplishment that comes along with making one yourself.<br /><br />Check out our podcast, The Art of Craftsmanship, on all of your favorite podcasting platforms, where we talk about making things, shop tips, fun stories, and YouTube content creation. <br /><br />Follow us on Instagram @theartofcraftsmanship and @theartofcameraguy to see whatâ€™s happening in the shop on a daily basis, join in with the live streams, and catch sneak peeks of our up coming videos. <br /><br />If you would like to purchase AOC merchandise, you can find us on Tee Spring here...<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://the-art-of-craftsmanship-3.creator-spring.com/">https://the-art-of-craftsmanship-3.creator-spring.com/</a><br /><br />To those of you who feel like you got something special from our videos and want to know how you can support us further, check out our Patreon page here... <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/theartofcraftsmanship">https://www.patreon.com/theartofcraftsmanship</a>{% endraw %}
