{% raw %}Hi! A spikes trap from nowhere appeared on the road in the BeamNG.Drive game. Cars don't notice the spikes and at high speed fall into a trap. Vehicles damage wheels and bodies. Fortunately, not far from the trap is an excellent tire and wheel repair service. The service master do transfers to his workshop with his tow truck. Repairs are not cheap, but in this jungle you will not find other help. If you are in trouble &quot;Good Hope&quot; tire service will help you!<br /><br />Thank you for watching!

Every component of a Beam NG vehicle is simulated in real-time using mass points and beams. In addition, crashes feel realistic, as the game uses an incredibly accurate damage model. This early access game is not complete, but you can play it already now.<br /><br />Beamng drive mods: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.beamng.com/resources/">https://www.beamng.com/resources/</a>{% endraw %}
