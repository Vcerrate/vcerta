{% raw %}An unidentified aircraft was shot down over Kharkov.<br /><br />A few hours ago, air defense systems destroyed an unidentified flying object (UFO) over Kharkov. This wording was given on the basis that so far it has not been possible to establish in a timely manner whether the aircraft or cruise missile was shot down.<br />According to the initial information that appeared, an unidentified flying object was hit by anti-aircraft guns. However, on video frames taken from a different angle, you can see that the fire on an unidentified flying object was carried out using an anti-aircraft missile system, since another missile of an unknown type was fired at the hit target.<br />On the presented video frames, you can see that the object was hit over the outskirts of Kharkov and began to fall apart right in the air. Judging by the absence of detonation, we can talk about an airplane or an unmanned aerial vehicle (the Armed Forces of Ukraine are armed with Bayraktar TB2 UAVs newly delivered from Turkey - ed.).<br />At the moment, there are no official statements on this subject, but there are also unconfirmed reports that the object could be a bait in order to establish the area where the air defense systems of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are located with the aim of their subsequent destruction.{% endraw %}
