{% raw %}BX is ultimately about fusing your front office of sales, marketing, service and product functions (no more siloes) and connecting it to the back office (e.g., HR, supply chain, etc.). It is an operating model change across the board that flips the focus from engaging customers at touch points to the full customer journey instead.{% endraw %}
