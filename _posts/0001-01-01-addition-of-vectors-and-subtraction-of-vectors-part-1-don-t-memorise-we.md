{% raw %}We know that to add two vectors we can apply the triangle law of vector addition or parallelogram law of vector addition. Can we apply any of these laws for addition of vectors? Or we have to use a particular law depending upon the vectors? Also what if we want to subtract one vector from another? Which law do we need to apply for the subtraction of vectors? Watch this video to know the answer to these questions. <br /><br />To watch more High School Math videos, click here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/HighSchoolMath_DMYT">https://bit.ly/HighSchoolMath_DMYT</a><br /><br />Donâ€™t Memorise brings learning to life through its captivating educational videos.
