{% raw %}This course aims to provide the students with hands-on training on programming languages and improve their logic building ability for problem solving. There are a total of 13 chapters where we gradually travel through basic concepts to advanced applications. <br />Each chapter has been designed with proper demonstration with a screen reader and students can easily follow through the contents. Apart from the videos, an extensive lectures notes will also be attached in the description box so that students can anytime refer them while studying. After every chapter, there will be 1 practice sheet which students are supposed to solve by them selves. These exercises will be fundamental for better practice and logic building. <br /><br />If you have any sort of concern or doubt, feel free to put them on the comment box. We will try to respond ASAP. <br /><br />About me:<br />I am Saurabh Prasad, a third year BTech student at IIIT Delhi in CSE branch and an incoming SWE intern at microsoft.
