{% raw %}Semi Automated Robotic Centrifuge Galvanizing plant designed to produce high volume hot dip galvanized zinc coatings of a high quality on a consistent basis. Each different type of article galvanized can be processed to follow a specific and unique program that has been designed, saved and then re-calibrates the process parameters for that specific batch of material.{% endraw %}
