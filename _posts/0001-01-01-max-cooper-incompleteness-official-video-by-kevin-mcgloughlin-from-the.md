That was the musical task with this one, and Kevin McGloughlin has beautifully delivered the visual representation of Incompleteness with all those hidden structures out of view from our restricted perspectives.<br /><br />The ideas came from the new album project with themes around the brain, in this case delving into some fundamentals of thinking machines, and what can or cannot be knowable. It turns out, quite amazingly, that you can prove that there's an infinitude of things out there which you cannot prove - a huge realm of unknowable truths putting a limit on our potential knowledge, so we're forever stuck with our single perspective out into the expanse, as in this music/video project released today.<br /><br />I apologise if I've explained that badly in my attempts to shorten it down, you can read the whole explanation of what I'm banging on about here on the album site, this being chapter 1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.onehundredbillionsparks.net/&quot;">https://www.onehundredbillionsparks.net/&quot;</a><br /><br />- - -<br /><br />Kevin McGloughlin:<br /><br />&quot;Incompleteness is a representation of 'the unprovable truth'.<br />The hidden truth in plain sight is impossible for the human brain to comprehend.<br />Quite an overwhelming fact. We can understand ideas, yet we can't comprehend or know them.<br />The fact that out there in the expanse there is a universe of possibility and conditions that we can never know or prove is a little bewildering. <br /><br />Collectively as humans we are gifted quite a sheltered existence.<br /><br />It's nice to think we can one day know these things...possibly in the next life, if it exists...but for now as humans, we cannot.<br /><br />I also tried to add the notion that people are unwilling or unable to appreciate their surroundings and choose to immerse themselves in an alternate, more materialistic world.<br /><br />It's a little ironic to say here...But, I think we have to look outside the screens and really live in the world outside.<br /><br />The technique in the video is inspired by the work of MustardCuffins, in particular his short film 'Plain Sight'.<br /><br /><br />- - -<br /><br />Shot in The Burren Co.Clare and Streedagh Co.Sligo.<br />Starring : Mike Lee<br /><br />- - -<br /><br />Further information:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://maxcooper.net">https://maxcooper.net</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kevinmcgloughlin.com">https://kevinmcgloughlin.com</a>{% endraw %}
