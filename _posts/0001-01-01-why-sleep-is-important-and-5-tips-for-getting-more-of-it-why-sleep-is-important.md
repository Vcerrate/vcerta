{% raw %}Why Sleep Is Important (And 5 Tips For Getting More Of It!)<br /><br />Meet Rahul, just your average guy. Like so many of us, he wants to get fit and look shredded. That’s why he goes to the gym, watches what he eats (most of the time), and sips on black coffee while munching on “low fat” snacks. <br /><br />But there’s a problem: despite all this, Rahul’s dream body is still just that - a distant dream! No matter how hard he tries, he can’t get rid of his belly fat. And over time, Rahul has noticed that his energy levels are down, and he’s feeling and looking worse with each passing week.<br /><br />What could be the problem?<br /><br />Rahul has been neglecting an important component of health and fitness - SLEEP! In this video, we explain why sleep is the missing link in your fitness journey, and share 5 simple yet effective tips to get in more snooze time.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Get Your Free Diet &amp; Workout Charts.
