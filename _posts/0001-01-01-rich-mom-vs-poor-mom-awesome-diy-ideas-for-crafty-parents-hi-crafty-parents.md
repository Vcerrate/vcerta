{% raw %}Hi, crafty parents! We prepared a lot of fun ways to entertain your kids. Some of them are cheaper, some of them are more expensive. But we ensure you that your kids will love these activities :) If your child loves playing with liquid soap and uses too much of it, try out our hack with a hair scrunchy ;) If your kid loves drawing, you can use different objects to draw on them. For example, you can reuse an empty pizza box and let your kid draw on it.<br />In this video, we will show you lots of cheap alternatives for everyday things. When it’s rainy outside, and your umbrella is broken, don’t worry! Use a plastic bag as a raincoat ;) Keep watching to find more DIY ideas and food hacks to surprise your kids.<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />01:09 — How to reuse a pizza box<br />02:21 — Fun DIY ideas with glasses<br />03:53 — DIY game for future hairstylists<br />08:12 — How to transform a boring t-shirt<br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
