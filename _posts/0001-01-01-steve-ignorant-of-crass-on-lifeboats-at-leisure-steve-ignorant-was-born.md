{% raw %}Steve Ignorant was born Stephen Williams in Dagenham in 1957. With a tough early family life, he moved to Bristol for a job working in a hospital putting plaster casts on broken limbs. <br /><br />Inspired by seeing a gig by The Clash, he decided to try and form a band, but finding that his old Essex pals weren't interested, he headed to poet and artist Penny Rimbaud's Dial House commune on the edge of Epping Forest in Essex. <br /><br />Rimbaud agreed to play the drums in what would become Crass, and the duo was joined by, among others, Eve Libertine, Phil Free, Joi De Vivre and Gee Vaucher.{% endraw %}
