{% raw %}Whilst in Japan shooting my next documentary, The Longevity Film, I was lucky enough to live with a local family who provided an insight into the diet of the immortals. <br /><br />On a small island called Okinawa in Japan, small communities exist where the average lifespan is far greater than that of all other countries in the world. In Okinawa, people are expected to grow into their 90s without getting sick, whilst remaining independent, and often with a big smile on their face. <br /><br />It was such a blessing to discuss and learn about their dietary habits and how this affected their longevity. I also noticed some non-dietary factors in their lifestyle which I think could contribute to their longevity such as purpose, community engagement &amp; a sharp attitude. <br /><br />If you enjoy this video subscribe to the channel now &amp; let me know in the comments what else you want to see. <br /><br />If you'd like to supercharge your gut health, head on over to The Gut Health Store website to grab some of the world's best gut health products <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.do/NiceLife">http://bit.do/NiceLife</a><br /><br />MY INSTAGRAM - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/kalesbroccoli">http://bit.ly/kalesbroccoli</a><br /><br />BOOKS I'VE WRITTEN - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/KaleBrockBooks">http://bit.ly/KaleBrockBooks</a><br /><br />THE GUT MOVIE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/GutMovie">http://bit.ly/GutMovie</a><br /><br />GUT HEALTH PRODUCTS - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.do/NiceLife">http://bit.do/NiceLife</a><br /><br />MY ONLINE COURSES - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/KaleBrockCourses">http://bit.ly/KaleBrockCourses</a>{% endraw %}
