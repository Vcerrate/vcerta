Unless these issues are resolved and codified, the entire edifice of international law - and, more specifically, the law of war - is in danger of crumbling. The contemporary multilateral regime proved inadequate and unable to effectively tackle genocide (Rwanda, Bosnia), terror (in Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East), weapons of mass destruction (Iraq, Iran, India, Israel, Pakistan, North Korea), and tyranny (in dozens of members of the United Nations, Russia and China included).<br /><br />This feebleness inevitably led to the resurgence of &quot;might is right&quot; unilateralism, as practiced, for instance, by the United States in places as diverse as Grenada and Iraq. This pernicious and ominous phenomenon is coupled with contempt towards and suspicion of international organizations, treaties, institutions, undertakings, and the prevailing consensual order.<br /><br />In a unipolar world, reliant on a single superpower for its security, the abrogation of the rules of the game could lead to chaotic and lethal anarchy with a multitude of &quot;rebellions&quot; against the emergent American Empire. International law - the formalism of &quot;natural law&quot; - is only one of many competing universalist and missionary value systems. Militant Islam is another. The West must adopt the former to counter the latter.{% endraw %}
