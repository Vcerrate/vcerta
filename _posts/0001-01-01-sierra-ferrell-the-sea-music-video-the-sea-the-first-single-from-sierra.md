{% raw %}“The Sea”, the first single from Sierra Ferrell’s debut album ‘Long Time Coming’, available August 20th. Pre-order it: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/SFLongTimeComing">https://found.ee/SFLongTimeComing</a><br /><br />I wrote &quot;The Sea&quot; to express my love for the ocean and the mysteries it possesses (my name is “Sea-erra,” after all!). The song came to me while I was living out of my van in Port Townsend, WA. The beach quickly became one of my favorite places. I would walk there every day and look for items that had washed ashore. At the time, I was seeing a blue-eyed Pisces and there was someone else I was interested in who was a Cancer. Those are both water signs so that’s how they weaseled their way in there! I had an amazing time working with director Casey Pierce and producer Bella Mazzola on this video and hope you enjoy It!<br /><br />Produced by: Bella Mazzola <br />Directed by: Casey Pierce<br />1st AD: Michael Mallicote<br />Production Assistant: James Gibson<br />Shot at Studio 8 Red King Productions<br /><br />Listen to “The Sea”:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/sierraferrell_thesea">https://found.ee/sierraferrell_thesea</a><br />Apple Music <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseaAM">https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseaAM</a><br />iTunes <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseaiTunes">https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseaiTunes</a><br />Spotify <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseaSp">https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseaSp</a><br />Amazon <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseaAmz">https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseaAmz</a><br />Amazon Music <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseaAmzu">https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseaAmzu</a><br />Pandora <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseaPandora">https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseaPandora</a><br />Youtube Music <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseaYTm">https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseaYTm</a><br />Tidal <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseatidal">https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseatidal</a><br />Deezer <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseaDeezer">https://found.ee/sierraferrell_theseaDeezer</a><br /><br />Listen to Sierra’s Mountain Queen Radio Playlist  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/SFMountainQueenRadio">https://found.ee/SFMountainQueenRadio</a><br /><br />FOLLOW SIERRA FERRELL<br />Website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/SFWebsite">https://found.ee/SFWebsite</a><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/SFFacebook">https://found.ee/SFFacebook</a><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/SFinstagram">https://found.ee/SFinstagram</a><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/SFTwitter">https://found.ee/SFTwitter</a><br />TikTok <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/SFTikTok">https://found.ee/SFTikTok</a><br /><br />Lyrics:<br />The sea, the sea, the sea<br />It's such a salty magic place<br />If you find yourself goin' under<br />You'll remember the taste<br /> <br />The waves, the waves, the waves<br />How they're puttin' out my flames<br />Whoa that's okay<br />I should be more tame<br /> <br />So Poseidon give me life<br />Let me breathe like a Pisces with blue eyes<br />Or a Cancer who's crawlin' by<br />So I'm askin' you this time<br />Please don't you let my love run dry<br />I'm so tired of you leavin' me with a sigh<br /> <br />The sea, the sea, the sea<br />It's such a salty magic place<br />You find yourself goin' under<br />You'll remember the taste<br /> <br />The waves, the waves, the waves<br />How they're puttin' out my flames<br />Whoa that's okay<br />I should be more tame<br /> <br />Well Poseidon give me life<br />Let me breathe like a Pisces with blue eyes<br />Or that Cancer who keeps crawlin' by<br />Well now I am askin' you this time<br />Please don't you let my love run dry<br />I'm so tired of you leavin' me with a sigh<br />Yes I'm so tired of you leavin' me with a sigh<br />Well I'm so tired of you leavin' me with a sigh<br /><br />#SierraFerrell #TheSea #LongTimeComing #MusicVideo{% endraw %}
