{% raw %}In this episode, Mark and I tackle the growing bubble in consumer credit.  We take a look at the personal savings rate and compared it to the sudden staggering increase in revolving credit.<br /><br />We discussed the evolution of banking in recent history, the growing and worrisome trend of &quot;Buy Now Pay Later&quot; and Apple's foray into that field, and covered the overall psychology of consumers during a recession.<br /><br />We ended the episode by covering BlockFi's down round, and whether or not we can expect more of the same in crypto and tech.  For that take, you'll have to tune into the show.<br />--<br />Follow Mark Yusko: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MarkYusko">https://twitter.com/MarkYusko</a><br />Follow Mike: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MikeIppolito_">https://twitter.com/MikeIppolito_</a><br />Follow Blockworks: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/blockworks_">https://twitter.com/blockworks_</a><br /><br />Get top market insights and the latest in crypto news.
