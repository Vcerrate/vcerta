{% raw %}CONGRATULATIONS to everyone who collected A Level results today. It is a scary time but we have made it and whatever lies ahead is for the best -- it has been set out for us and this pathway is the one we are supposed to take. I wish you all the very best... <br /><br />Before I opened my results, I was expecting to get a C in Chemistry, a B in English and a B in RS but I was hoping beyond measure that I would get an A* in RS, an A/A* in English and an A in Chemistry :)<br /><br />I'm exactly the kind of person who, whatever I get, my first thought is that I could have done better. I start scrutinising my results to see where I could (and thereby should) have scored higher. It's not a very productive and rational way of approaching anything but I hope that explains why, despite being happy, I managed to find something to be anxious about. As a whole, I really try to be positive; however, when it comes to INITIALLY RECEIVING exam results, I am at my most cynical!! Even if I get the top grade, I will beat myself up for not getting a higher raw mark. <br /><br />My Study Planner - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pumpkinproductivity.co.uk...">https://www.pumpkinproductivity.co.uk...</a> <br />(this is now also available as a pdf download).<br />My Book - Erimentha Parker’s To Do List (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2pcgyrm)">http://amzn.to/2pcgyrm)</a> <br /><br />——————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />CONTACT ME:<br />Email - rubygranger@sixteenth.co<br />Instagram - @_rubygranger<br />Ask.fm - @rubygranger<br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/grangerlifes...">https://www.facebook.com/grangerlifes...</a><br />Tumblr - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mygrangerlifestyle.tumblr.com/">https://mygrangerlifestyle.tumblr.com/</a><br />Goodreads - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...">https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...</a><br />Twitter - @rubygranger8<br />Religious Studies Twitter - @cartesian_finds{% endraw %}
