Placing a pan on the burner or a stove makes the pan or the pot hot due to conducting of heat.<br /><br />Convection<br />Convection is the mode of heat transfer in which fluids are moved in order to transfer heat. <br />Boiling water is an example of heat transfer through convection.<br />There is the actual movement of heated atoms and molecules in case of convection whereas, in conduction, the heat is transferred through vibration â€“ atoms or molecules do not leave their original position.<br /><br />Steam coming up from a hot cup of coffee is an example of heat transfer through convection as the steam is transferring heat from the coffee to the surrounding air through convection.<br />Melting of ice is also an example of heat transfer through convection as a heat transfer from the surrounding air to the ice through convection.<br /> <br />Now let's learn about the third mode of heat transfer which is own as radiation.<br />In this mode of heating, heat is transferred in the form of radiant energy or wave motion from one body to another body, and no medium is required for this mode of heating, or heat is transferred through a transparent medium.<br />This property of radiation is different from convection and conduction as both convection and conduction require some medium for the heat to travel from hotter region to colder region.<br />So heat or warmth that you feel seating neat any hot object is due to the radiation of heat from that hot object.<br /><br />All the life forms on earth need energy from the sun which reaches them through radiation.<br />yes! heat energy travels from the sun to the earth through radiation.<br />Sunlight reaches us and no medium is required by the radiations to reach the earth, So the radiation can travel even in a vacuum.<br /><br /><br />I hope you liked our video.<br />Kids should spend time watching informative videos and expand their knowledge day by day.<br />Kids retain what they see in audio-visual lessons so make them watch informative videos rather than cramming things.<br /><br />If you want to learn any topic, please free to write to us, we will upload the video to help you out as soon as possible.<br />We can also create a customized u tube playlist for the topics you want to learn.<br />Your feedback is important to us.<br /><br />Stay connected with us:<br />tutwayhelpdesk@gmail.com<br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL-KeqwBmYvEBpAiUOmkIQw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL-KeqwBmYvEBpAiUOmkIQw</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/tutway/">https://www.facebook.com/tutway/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tutway.com/">https://www.tutway.com/</a>{% endraw %}
