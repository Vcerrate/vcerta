Bruno Mars - Mirror ðŸŽµ<br /><br />[Lil Wayne:]<br />Uh<br />With everything happening today<br />You don't know whether you're coming or going<br />But you think that you're on your way<br />Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it, woo.<br />Look at me when I'm talking to you<br />You looking at me but I'm looking through you<br />I see the blood in your eyes<br />I see the love in disguise<br />I see the pain hidden in your pride<br />I see you're not satisfied<br />And I don't see nobody else<br />I see myself I'm looking at the...<br /><br />[Bruno Mars:]<br />Mirror on the wall ([Wayne:] Ooh), here we are again ([Wayne:] Yeah)<br />Through my rise and fall ([Wayne:] Uh)<br />You've been my only friend ([Wayne:] Yeah)<br />You told me that they can understand the man I am<br />So why are we here talkin' to each other again?<br /><br />[Lil Wayne:]<br />Uh, I see the truth in your lies<br />I see nobody by your side<br />But I'm with you when you all alone<br />And you correct me when I'm looking wrong<br />I see the guilt beneath the shame<br />I see your soul through your window pane<br />I see the scars that remain<br />I see you Wayne, I'm looking at the...<br /><br />[Bruno Mars:]<br />Mirror on the wall, here we are again ([Wayne:] Yeah)<br />Through my rise and fall ([Wayne:] Uh-Huh)<br />You've been my only friend ([Wayne:] my only friend)<br />You told me that they can understand the man I am ([Wayne:] they can understand)<br />So why are we here ([Wayne:] misunderstood) talkin' to each other again?<br /><br />[Lil Wayne:]<br />Looking at me now I can see my past<br />Damn, I look just like my fucking dad<br />Light it up, that's smoke in mirrors<br />I even look good in the broken mirror<br />I see my mamma smileâ€“that's a blessing<br />I see the change, I see the message<br />And no message could've been any clearer<br />So I'm startin' with the man in the...<br /><br />[Bruno Mars:]<br />Mirror on the wall,<br /><br />[Lil Wayne:]<br />MJ taught me that.<br /><br />[Bruno Mars:]<br />Here we are again<br />Through my rise and fall ([Wayne:] Uh)<br />You've been my only friend<br /><br />[Lil Wayne:]<br />Take 'em to Mars man<br /><br />[Bruno Mars:]<br />You told me that they can understand the man I am<br />So why are we talkin' to each other again?<br /><br />[Lil Wayne:]<br />Uh...<br /><br />[Bruno Mars:]<br />Mirror on the wall ([Wayne:] Ooh), here we are again ([Wayne:] Yeah)<br />Through my rise and fall<br />You've been my only friend ([Wayne:] Any questions?)<br />You told me that they can ([Wayne:] I come to you) understand the man I am ([Wayne:] You always have the answer)<br />So why are we here talkin' to each other again?<br /><br />[Bruno Mars:]<br />Mirror on the wall.<br /><br />[Wayne:]<br />Ay, B.P.<br />Looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time<br /><br />[Bruno Mars:]<br />So why are we talking to each other again?<br /><br />Wallpaper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unsplash.com/">https://unsplash.com/</a><br /><br />#LilWayne #BrunoMars #Mirror #Awelyrics #mirrorlyrics #brunomarslyrics #lilwaynelyrics #lilwaynebrunomarsmirror #lilwaynebrunomarsmirrorlyrics #music #songs{% endraw %}
