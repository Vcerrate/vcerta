{% raw %}Since the trilogy is now out, people are working through the games challenges and some of my guides are now over 5 years old. They could do with a refresh.<br /><br />So starting from Monday I will be working through the Hitman 1 maps then move onto Hitman 2 maps, all within Hitman 3 (Trilogy). Then I'll do the bonus missions from 1 and 2. <br /><br />This will take a very long time. Perhaps 200-300 videos.<br /><br />So what you can expect is a high amount of uploads. Perhaps 2 or 3 a day, maybe more. So I'm just making you aware of that before it starts.<br /><br />I'll also put the challenges for each games maps in their own playlist so they're easily accessible to work through. <br /><br />For the latest videos like News, Updates, Elusive Targets etc, I'll leave a 2 day gap between them and the challenge videos as those latest ones are the priority and I don't want them buried in the uploads. I'll also put those important videos as a featured video on the channels homepage. So make sure you're subscribed so you can see those featured videos over the trailer video on my homepage.<br /><br />This might take months to get through but I feel like it's necessary for the longevity of the guides so they work even in 10 years time.<br /><br />Top 10 Tips and Tricks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/dMx_ROaaKwI">https://youtu.be/dMx_ROaaKwI</a><br /><br />The 6 Types of Accident Kills &amp; Why They're Important:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/hsjosGtpwSY">https://youtu.be/hsjosGtpwSY</a><br /><br />Use affiliate code: FREEZE2244 at the checkout on the Epic Games Store when you preorder or purchase any game to support me for free!<br /><br />Link to HITMAN 3 Order Page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/hitman-3/home">https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/hitman-3/home</a><br /><br />Thanks very much for watching an be sure to let me know in the comments your thoughts below.<br /><br />If you would like to support the channel, consider joining the channel membership: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5S1IXqjZUf_PM2XhCM-4vg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5S1IXqjZUf_PM2XhCM-4vg/join</a> and get an exclusive gold hitman logo next to your name in comments on videos and livestreams.
