{% raw %}Remember the mysterious &quot;Venomous Reptile&quot; box we brought in right before Grand Opening? Today you'll officially meet Justin Timbersnake, our educational timber rattlesnake!<br /><br />*We do not recommend venomous reptiles as pets. That being said, make sure it's legal to own venomous reptiles where you live prior to getting one. We contacted our local DNR enforcement representative before getting ours. To clarify, he is technically owned by Snake Discovery in Wisconsin, on loan to the educational facility we have in Minnesota. <br /><br />SNAKE DISCOVERY MERCH! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://snakediscoverystore.square.site/s/shop">https://snakediscoverystore.square.site/s/shop</a><br /><br />SNAKE DISCOVERY PATREON<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/snakediscovery">https://www.patreon.com/snakediscovery</a> <br /><br />We love fan mail! <br />Snake Discovery <br />P.O.
