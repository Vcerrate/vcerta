{% raw %}I made this video to give you a quick overview of supply and demand. I cover the law of demand, law of supply, shifters of demand and supply, shortage, surplus, and changes in equilibrium. I go pretty quick so watch the entire  video first before you try to take any notes. Also, be sure to practice, practice, practice. Thanks for watching. Good luck in your econ class. <br /><br />Need more practice?
