{% raw %}In this episode, I discuss ways to set up your workspace to optimize productivity, focus and creativity. I discuss how to adjust light, physically arrange your work environment, and leverage body posture to enhance productivity. Additionally, I explore how to shift your work environment for particular types of tasks. Moreover, I review the role of body movement in the workspace. I also discuss sound-based tools that can either enhance or diminish cognitive functioning (the ability to focus on deep work). I describe a particular frequency of binaural beats that studies show can be used to enhance memory and recall. This episode covers quality peer-reviewed findings practical tools anyone can use, regardless of budget, in order to optimize their workspace to achieve heightened levels of productivity, increased alertness and focus, and creativity.<br /><br />#HubermanLab #Neuroscience #Productivity<br /><br />Thank you to our sponsors:<br />LMNT - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drinkLMNT.com/huberman">https://www.drinkLMNT.com/huberman</a><br />AG1 (Athletic Greens) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman</a><br />Theragun - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://theragun.com/huberman">https://theragun.com/huberman</a><br /><br />Our Patreon page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman">https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman</a><br /><br />Supplements from Thorne:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman">http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman</a><br /><br />Social &amp; Website<br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab">https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hubermanlab">https://twitter.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab">https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.com">https://hubermanlab.com</a><br />Newsletter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network">https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network</a><br /><br />Links:<br />The Influence of Ceiling Height: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3gcB31K">https://bit.ly/3gcB31K</a><br />Heating, Ventilation, &amp; AC Noise During Mental Work: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3rbG69c">https://bit.ly/3rbG69c</a><br />Office Noise &amp; Employee Concentration: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3AMoJPa">https://bit.ly/3AMoJPa</a><br />Effects of a Workplace Sit-Stand Desk Intervention on Health &amp; Productivity: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3reelwF">https://bit.ly/3reelwF</a><br />Effects of Binaural &amp; Monaural Beats on Attention: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3IN2Wda">https://bit.ly/3IN2Wda</a><br />40-Hz Binaural Beats Enhance Training to Mitigate the Attentional Blink: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.nature.com/35BVrYh">https://go.nature.com/35BVrYh</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />00:00:00 Arranging Environment for Focus<br />00:02:40 LMNT, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Theragun<br />00:07:55 How to Increase Focus<br />00:10:02 Lighting Your Work in Phase 1<br />00:16:00 Lighting Your Work in Phase 2<br />00:19:45 Lighting Your Work in Phase 3<br />00:24:17 Where to Look While You Work<br />00:28:02 Arranging Your Environment<br />00:31:24 Body Posture<br />00:34:22 How Long to Do Deep Work<br />00:36:50 Set the Right Visual Window Size<br />00:42:15 45 min / 5 min Rule<br />00:44:23 The Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work<br />00:55:50 Leveraging Background Noise<br />01:02:20 Binaural Beats for Work<br />01:06:38 The Best Binaural Frequency for Work<br />01:11:17 How Binaural Beats Increase Focus<br />01:13:56 Minimizing Interruptions<br />01:20:01 Sit or Stand, or Both?<br />01:25:18 Movement in the Workspace<br />01:31:00 Summary &amp; Shifting Work Environments<br />01:39:36 Zero-Cost Support, Sponsors, Patreon, Instagram, Twitter, Thorne<br /><br />Please note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.
