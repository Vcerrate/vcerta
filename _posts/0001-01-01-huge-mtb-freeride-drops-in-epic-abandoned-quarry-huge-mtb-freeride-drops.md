{% raw %}Huge MTB freeride drops in an abandoned quarry on my Haibike enduro bike!! I search for sick riding spots before switching to my custom dirt jump bike and sending tricks at an indoor skatepark! What would you ride?<br /><br />I start the day with some heavy impacts off some pretty sizable drops in an abandoned quarry on my Haibike E mountain bike and push the suspension to the limits on the landings. After cruising around and hitting numerous features the rain decided to fall so we rushed to the van and switched on to the Custom Haibike dirt jump bike that I have. We decided to escape the bad weather and ride the awesome Prevail indoor skatepark in Poole which was pretty perfect for the jump bike. The quarter pipes where nice and mellow and I was also lucky enough to have the park basically to myself :) <br />What is your prefered kind of riding?<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the video!<br /><br /><br /><br />PRE ORDER MERCH HERE:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tothesky.store/">https://www.tothesky.store/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br />Welcome to my channel, I'm a professional Freeride Mountain biker and former FMB world champion(2013).  <br /><br /><br /><br />This channel is all about Mountain biking, I make a huge variety of videos for everyone who loves dirt: From downhill biking to slower paced trials riding and everything in between like dirt jumping, slopestyle and enduro!  <br /><br /><br /><br />As well as making entertaining videos(I hope) I also like to help YOU out too, with videos such as:  <br /><br />- How to ride better <br /><br />- Trick tips and How to's <br /><br />- Travel VLOGS <br /><br />- GoPro camera tips <br /><br />- In-depth entertaining features <br /><br />- POV craziness <br /><br />- Funny videos <br /><br /><br /><br /> I also try to reply to everyone so leave some comments too!{% endraw %}
