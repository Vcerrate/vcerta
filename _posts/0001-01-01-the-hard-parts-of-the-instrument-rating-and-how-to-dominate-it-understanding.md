{% raw %}Understanding what hard (and easy) things are in store for the instrument rating can help increase the chances that you'll finish successfully.

Thankfully, there are also a lot of parts about it that are actually quite easy, and reminding ourselves of those can be a great encouragement! <br /><br />Video Chapters:<br />0:00 - Expect the hard parts<br />0:16 - Situational Awareness<br />1:08 - My iPad Setup<br />1:44 - Flying the Airplane in IFR<br />2:10 - Volume of Material <br />2:21 - Tabbed FAR/AIM <br />3:21 - Aviation Flash Cards<br />4:06 - Air Traffic Control<br />4:41 - IFR Clearances<br />5:36 - Approach Clearances<br />6:30 - Duration<br />7:18 - Repetition <br />7:38 - My Favorite Part<br /><br />Mentioned in the video: <br /><br />- My iPad Setup: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Mrx7RAlEbQE">https://youtu.be/Mrx7RAlEbQE</a><br /><br />- My iPad Mount of Choice: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://flyboys.com/?ref=Charlie">https://flyboys.com/?ref=Charlie</a><br /><br />- FAR/AIM Video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/p8jwIA9umUM">https://youtu.be/p8jwIA9umUM</a><br /><br />- Pre-tabbed FAR/AIM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://livelyaviation.myshopify.com/?ref=charlie">https://livelyaviation.myshopify.com/?ref=charlie</a><br /><br />- Aviation Flash Cards: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://flashaviation.shop?aff=18">https://flashaviation.shop?aff=18</a><br /><br />==<br /><br />Looking to start your aviation journey but not sure where to begin?
