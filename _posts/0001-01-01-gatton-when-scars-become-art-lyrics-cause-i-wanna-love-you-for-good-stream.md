'Cause she said that, too<br />And how<br />Will you love me?<br />I was told I didn't deserve love, at least that's the theme<br /><br />[Verse 2: Gatton &amp; Brooke Young]<br />Now don't say<br />Don't say that you'll stay for good<br />Don't tell me what I want to hear 'cause you think you should<br />And teach<br />Teach me to heal my scars<br />I've heard it said, that beauty is when scars become art<br /><br />[Chorus: Gatton &amp; Brooke Young]<br />'Cause I wanna love you for good<br />For good or for bad<br />When times get sad<br />And when we fight<br />And I wanna love you for good<br />For good or for bad<br />When you make me mad<br />'Cause you're the love of my life<br /><br />[Bridge: Gatton, Gatton &amp; Brooke Young]<br />So take my hand<br />I wanna grow old with you beside me<br />So take my hand<br />I wanna grow old with you beside me-e-e-e<br />So take my hand<br />I wanna grow old with you beside me, ohhh<br />So take my hand<br />I wanna grow old with you beside me<br /><br />[Chorus: Gatton &amp; Brooke Young]<br />'Cause I wanna love you for good<br />For good or for bad<br />When times get sad<br />And when we fight<br />And I wanna love you for good<br />For good or for bad<br />When you make me mad<br />'Cause you're the love of my life<br /><br />[Outro: Gatton]<br />Now how<br />How will I move on?<br />You taught me how to love again and now you're gone<br />And how<br />Will I bear the pain?<br />I guess for now I'll leave these flowers here, at your grave<br /><br />Â» Side channels:<br />Weary - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGd_qV6XIvJ9DoKtx0_NyuA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGd_qV6XIvJ9DoKtx0_NyuA</a><br />FutureHype - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTwct4oAsyuyGxOtva0FcUg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTwct4oAsyuyGxOtva0FcUg</a><br /><br />Buisness Inquires: erik@syrebralvibes.com<br /><br />ðŸ’–Comment &quot;i love u&quot; if you're reading this<br /><br />#Gatton #WhenScarsBecomeArt #TikTokSongs{% endraw %}
