{% raw %}A soft house upbeat study music mix with beta wave isochronic tones.  Part of my peak focus for complex tasks series.  Designed to produce a deep focus mental state while studying or working.   <br /><br />► Upbeat Study Music Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H12Fk08_2TQ&amp;list=PLveg0IEcZWN7eQvidQOrkxiBvH0Skewwv">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H12Fk08_2TQ&amp;list=PLveg0IEcZWN7eQvidQOrkxiBvH0Skewwv</a><br /><br />► Subscribe to my channel and be updated with my latest tracks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MindAmend?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/user/MindAmend?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Use this track when working on advanced and complicated topics like coding/programming, mathematics, scientific formulas, financial analysis or any complex mental activity.<br /><br />Isochronic tones produce a stronger and more powerful brainwave entrainment effect when compared to binaural beats or standard music.<br /><br />What is this?<br /><br />This is a high-intensity audio brainwave entrainment session, using isochronic tones.  Listen to this when you need a strong burst of intense focus to concentrate and study things like advanced mathematics, scientific formulas, financial analysis or any other complex mental activity. <br /><br />How is this session constructed?<br /><br />The session starts off beating at 10Hz and ramps up to the 18Hz range by the 6-minute mark.  The isochronic tones frequency then randomly fluctuates between 17.5-18.5Hz to help prevent habituation.  This stops you from getting too used to the same frequency when using the track regularly over time.  Once the track gets to the final 5 minutes it ramps back down to 10Hz again.  You can see an image showing how the session is constructed at the beginning of the video.<br /><br />How to use it?<br /><br />Listen to this track with your eyes open while doing the task/activity you want to focus on.<br /><br />Headphones are NOT required<br /><br />Although headphones are not required you may find they produce a more intense effect, because they help to block out distracting external sounds. <br /><br />When to listen?<br /><br />Because this track increases your beta brainwave activity, it's best to listen to this during the daytime and early evening.  If you listen to this too close to bedtime, it might disrupt your sleep, in a similar way to how you might respond if you drank coffee just before going to bed.<br /><br />How loud should the volume be?<br /><br />The main thing to consider is that it should be loud enough to hear the repetitive isochronic tones, so you don't want it so quiet you can hardly hear them.  But you also don't want it so loud that it's uncomfortable for you and hurts your ears, or gives you a headache.  I'd recommend starting with the volume around halfway and adjust it to a level that you feel comfortable with from there.<br /><br />How Isochronic Tones Work<br /><br />If brainwave entrainment and isochronic tones are new concepts for you, you can find out how everything works and the potential benefits here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.mindamend.com/brainwave-entrainment/isochronic-tones/">http://www.mindamend.com/brainwave-entrainment/isochronic-tones/</a><br /><br />#IsochronicTonesStudy<br />#FocusMusic<br />#SoftHouseStudy<br />-----<br />Artist: Jones Meadow<br />Tracks: Last Dream, Grove, Lobby, Thoughts, Arlanda, Midnite Sun, Straws, Strivers Row, Varg, Moves, Final Goodbyes, Surface.
