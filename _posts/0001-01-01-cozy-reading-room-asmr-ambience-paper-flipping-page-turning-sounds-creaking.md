It is a lot of work to create an animated video, because you need at least three software.<br />First you need a lot of software skills to create the furniture in 3D. After creating and texturing the 3D-models with Blender you need to render this scene and edit it with e.g. Affinity Photo or Photoshop to optimize the light effects.<br />In the last part you add with a video-editing software some effects to make this scene &quot;alive&quot;.<br /><br />____________________________________<br /><br />Software used:<br />- Affinity Photo<br />- Adobe Premiere Pro CC<br />____________________________________<br /><br />► Check out my Playlists:<br /><br />Fireplace Crackling and Relaxing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Vr41wIkkKw&amp;list=PL4BzuD0CGftDrsyoEMRxbLjih19DOsDB-">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Vr41wIkkKw&amp;list=PL4BzuD0CGftDrsyoEMRxbLjih19DOsDB-</a><br /><br />Many thanks to everyone for listening and for leaving your comment.<br /><br />If you have ideas or suggestions, please let me know in the comments<br /><br />Created by Nature and Relaxation ©<br />Nature and Relaxation is the owner of the video and audio.
