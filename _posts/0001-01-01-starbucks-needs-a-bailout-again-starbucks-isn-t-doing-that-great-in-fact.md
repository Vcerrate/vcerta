{% raw %}Starbucks isn’t doing that great. In fact, they’re getting obliterated as they navigate high inflation combined with staff and supply shortages. The cherry on top is the recent push for unions within Starbucks which has proven to be quite successful. This has caused Starbucks stock to sell off 40% which correlates to a market cap loss of $66.4 billion. Things have gotten so bad that Starbucks’ retired father Howard Schultz is returning to Starbucks for the 3rd time to hopefully turn the company around again. This turnaround isn’t going to be easy though. Howard isn’t just facing business issues like he usually does. This time, Howard has to tackle the delicate issue of labor unions. Historically, Starbucks has had a pretty good reputation when it comes to employee treatment and satisfaction, but making a wrong move against unions could destroy this positive reputation. So, Howard must figure out how to turn around Starbucks without turning the public or Starbucks employees on him. This video explains the various shortfalls of Starbucks and what happened to Starbucks. <br /><br />Discord Community: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/SJUNWNt">https://discord.gg/SJUNWNt</a><br /><br />Timestamps: <br />0:00 - Starbucks<br />1:30 - Shortages<br />4:23 - Inflation<br />6:13 - Botched Online System<br />8:03 - Unions<br />10:16 - The State Of Starbucks<br /><br />Thumbnail Credit: <br />Joshua Trujillo<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3PBDMm1">https://bit.ly/3PBDMm1</a><br /><br />Resources: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/KVPXu3NM">https://pastebin.com/KVPXu3NM</a>{% endraw %}
