{% raw %}Hilary Swank stars in her OscarÂ® winning role of the true life story of Brandon Teena in Boys Don't Cry.  Brandon Teena is the popular new guy in a tiny Nebraska town.  He hangs out with the guys, drinking, cussing, and bumper surfing, and he charms the young women, who've never met a more sensitive and considerate young man.  Life is good for Brandon, now that he's one of the guys and dating hometown beauty Lana.  However, he's forgotten to mention one important detail.  It's not that he's wanted in another town for grand theft auto and other assorted crimes, but that Brandon Teena is actually a woman named Teena Brandon.  When Brandon's best friends make this discovery, his life eventually is ripped apart by betrayal, humiliation, rape, and murder.{% endraw %}
