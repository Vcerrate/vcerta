{% raw %}MANTRA OF DIVINE LOVE FOR FULFILLMENT OF WISHES.<br />Bhajo Nitay Gauranga Radha Shyam Japa Hare Krishna Hare Ram.<br />“Bhaja” here stands for seva. It stands for the service one is rendering. It´s not a physical service, but it’s a service to the world through vibration. <br /><br />The aim of human life is to attain pure love, so that you can truly say that you have loved #God .There are stages to reach sacred love - prem. In this yuga they say always “chanting the #Divine Name one achieves that level”.  <br /><br />#Gauranga is a combination of Radha/Krishna, so that’s why we are singing “Bhaja Nitai Gaur” – service to Nitai and Gauranga, which is service to #Radha and #Krishna . <br /><br />“Japa Hare Krishna Hare Ram” – at the same time you are chanting the #mahamantra also. <br /><br />By #chanting “Bhaja Nitai Gauranga Radha Shyam Japa #hare Krishna hare Ram”, you give of your time is a great contribution. Because everything is vibration, you know, everything vibrates. This time, when you concentrate and when you are chanting – He is here. And that´s what the mantra awakes. The knowing, that He is the Lord that governs everything. He is the #Lord that governs your heart and He is the Lord of your heart and nobody else. In the Gita, it says “All the names that you chant are mine, all the forms are just inside of me, not out of me. Nothing can exist out of me. Whatever you see…”.<br /><br />************************************************************************<br /><br />Mantra - it is a combination of special sounds and vibrations that purify space, body, mind and consciousness from negative energies. Mantra – it is an ancient sacred formula that gives a powerful Divine energy, it is the key that opens the way to the Supreme Divine knowledge.<br /><br />Repeat the mantras possible any number of times, but the most importantly the number of repetitions has to be a multiple of three. You can repeat them 3,6,9,15 ... times, but the best effect is obtained with a daily repetition of mantras 108 times, because the number of one hundred and eight is considered sacred. One – it symbolizes the Supreme Divine Energy, zero – it is the perfection of God's creation and eight – it is a symbol of eternity and infinity in an inverted form.<br /><br />In order not to make mistakes in counting the number of times they recommend to use the rosary. Rosary also helps to concentrate better on the mantra and sensations and also while singing mantras it is charging with powerful energy and can serves as an excellent talisman and amulet.<br /><br />- Subscribe for new videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeVefxaWBcjrvHxcc5EfIqw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeVefxaWBcjrvHxcc5EfIqw?sub_confirmation=1</a> <br /><br />- Mantras for protection: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaX2em7KpV8l0w1zqe859llwBVJCE0553">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaX2em7KpV8l0w1zqe859llwBVJCE0553</a> <br />- Mantras of wealth and prosperity: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaX2em7KpV8lsLqhYaQCH0-Y2jWXFDv3m">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaX2em7KpV8lsLqhYaQCH0-Y2jWXFDv3m</a> <br />- Mantras of health and longevity: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaX2em7KpV8nJPSzhohbOofs2Wc9_qlOB">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaX2em7KpV8nJPSzhohbOofs2Wc9_qlOB</a> <br />- Mantras of beauty and youth: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaX2em7KpV8n5W2XdqcpXR1x-w6riYx2S">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaX2em7KpV8n5W2XdqcpXR1x-w6riYx2S</a> <br />- Mantras of love: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaX2em7KpV8lhl7rCS7y9seQ-ABVQ-lnI">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaX2em7KpV8lhl7rCS7y9seQ-ABVQ-lnI</a> <br />- Mantras of wish-fulfilling: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaX2em7KpV8kn438GBzLMvBdehthSFnHx">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaX2em7KpV8kn438GBzLMvBdehthSFnHx</a> <br />- Mantras of spiritual development: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaX2em7KpV8kpQ3ekxUFenXG6Us1CejHw">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaX2em7KpV8kpQ3ekxUFenXG6Us1CejHw</a><br /><br />************************************************************************{% endraw %}
