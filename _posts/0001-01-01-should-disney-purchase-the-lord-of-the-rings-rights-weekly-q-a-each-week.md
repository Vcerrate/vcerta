{% raw %}Each week, I answer questions from our community including Patreons/YouTube Channel Members and this week, questions included:<br /><br /><br /><br />Do you think Disney have possibly paid to remove the last of their shows from Netflix?<br /><br />With the Tolkien rights apparently now available, do you think Disney should go for them and if so, what do you think they will do?<br /><br />With the announcement of “general content being added to Disney+ US” what sort of shows are you expecting to see get added? Is this Disney almost accepting they need to add the STAR style of content?<br /><br />When do you think we can expect official dates for the next wave of D+ launches Q2 earnings?<br /><br />And much more<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Become a YouTube Channel Member to take part in the live chat or if you don’t want to become a member, you can also submit a Superchat during the live stream with your question.<br /><br /><br /><br />If you enjoy our content, please consider supporting it via our Patreon or become a YouTube Channel member from as little as $2 a month and get access to exclusive content and much more.{% endraw %}
