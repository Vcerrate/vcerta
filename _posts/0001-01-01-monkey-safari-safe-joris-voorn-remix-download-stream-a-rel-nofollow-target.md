'We produced Safe as a message of unity, hope and love. When we came to release it, we realised it soundtracked our socially isolated emotions to perfection. Sharing emotions is one of our main motivations when producing music and DJing. Getting together, dancing together, smiling together.'<br /><br />As we navigated the summer's choppy dancefloor waters, 'Safe' became the anthem we all anticipated. Goosebump-inducing, chill-delivering. Sunset, peaktime or sunrise. It became the soundtrack to a brighter future.<br /><br />Fresh for '22 it returns, revisioned and remixed by none other than Spectrum boss Joris Voorn. Ready to comfort and lift us once again.{% endraw %}
