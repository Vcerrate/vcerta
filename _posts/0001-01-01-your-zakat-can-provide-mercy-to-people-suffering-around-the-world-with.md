{% raw %}With Human Appeal, your Zakat is transforming communities, saving lives and protecting entire societies and future generations. In times of need and crisis, your Zakat has helped us create long term change, creating better lives and brighter futures. Last year, your Zakat was a tremendous source of mercy to almost 500,000 vulnerable people. This year, millions continue to live with the devastating impacts of poverty, climate change, Covid-19, war and disasters. Make the most of your Zakat with our 100% donation policy. <br /><br />Give mercy now.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://humanappeal.org.uk/appeals/zakat-and-nisab">https://humanappeal.org.uk/appeals/zakat-and-nisab</a>{% endraw %}
