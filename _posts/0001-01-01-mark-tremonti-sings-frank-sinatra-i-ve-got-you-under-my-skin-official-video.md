An actor can sing, an athlete can dance, a musician can sing a song out of their musical genre -<br />any artistic interpretation. This gives the artist the ability to do something out of the ordinary, in fact extraordinary all in the name of charity. Tremonti Sings Sinatra will be the first<br />release for the cause, the recipient being NDSS.<br /><br />Mark says, “For years, I’ve loved singing along to Frank’s songs,” he reveals. “One night, I found an old video of him performing ‘The Song Is You’ from 1944. It made me study <br />how he got his start. I read all of the books, and I watched all of the movies. I wanted to do something with it. When we found out about our daughter Stella’s Down Syndrome <br />diagnosis, the stars aligned. My obsession with Sinatra had its reason. He raised more than a billion dollars for charity. Beneath the cool and calm persona, there was a big heart.<br /> Doing this charity in his name was another way the stars had aligned. I decided to do this record to raise funds for families and individuals with Down Syndrome. Now, it’s a new<br />purpose for the rest of my life.”{% endraw %}
