This great golf tip and practice drill can be done at home in your back yard and the best thing is you do not need a single grain of sand to do it! <br /><br />All you need is a golf ball or a whiffle ball, a tee peg and your sand iron. <br /><br />No sand needed!<br /><br />Place the golf bal on the tee peg and your only objective is to swing through and only hit the tee so the ball drops harmlessly straight down and doesn't go into your neighbours window!<br /><br />This is a great way to practice and improve your bunker play is to use this drill at the short game practice area and make a shot clipping the tee like you see in the video ad then go and find the same sensation of acceleration and confidence in the bunker making contact with the sand and inch or so behind the ball. This will give you hopefully the spanking sound that is a sign of good control and spin. Do this and you golf score will be lower.<br /><br />So even if you cannot get to a practice area and you always complain about how difficult you find bunker shots then don't say I ever gave you a great golf tips and solution to practice this part of your game and do it at home too! <br /><br />This is maybe best bunker lesson that you have never likely heard of.<br /><br />It's so obvious and effective you will be frustrated you have not been <br />using it sooner.<br /><br />You see I know you are busy I get that, that's why I want you see this <br />great tip as I KNOW it will really help instantly.
