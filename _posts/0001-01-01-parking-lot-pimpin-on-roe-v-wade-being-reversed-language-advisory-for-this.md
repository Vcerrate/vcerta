{% raw %}Language advisory for this video. But what in the civil rights movement going on with y’all?? 🤦🏾‍♀️<br /><br />I literally had to channel the energy of my ancestors with my womens March tee lol cause what do you mean Roe V Wade was egregious in the first place.<br /><br />What’s egregious is y’all continuing to assume women are incapable of decision making. 🥴🤢🤮<br /><br />Speaking of decision making, I hope you decide to buy your ticket now. VIP already filling up. 🤷🏾‍♀️<br /><br />Tickets for the live show are now available. #LinkInBio{% endraw %}
