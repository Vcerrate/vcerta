{% raw %}Ever Forward Sets Sail - Never Forward is Never More<br /><br />What's Going on With Shipping?  <br />April 22, 2022 <br /><br />In this episode, Sal Mercogliano - former merchant mariner and maritime historian at Campbell University - discusses the final inspection that has cleared MV Ever Forward to continue her voyage after being grounded for 35 days outside the port of Baltimore, Maryland back on March 13, 2022.  She sailed from Annapolis to the Seagirt Terminal and will backload 500+ containers and then continue on to Norfolk, New York and the Panama Canal enroute back to Asia.  Also discussed is the claim by Maryland for a $100 million responsibility fund to cover any environmental claims, the declaration of General Average against the cargo; and the fact  that the National Transportation Safety Board and US Coast Guard have failed to release any information on the cause of the grounding.  <br /><br />#EverForward #container #containership #supplychain #logistics #grounding #Chesapeake <br /><br />Support What's Going on With Shipping via Patreon<br />www.patreon.com/wgowshipping  <br /><br />Marine Traffic - Ever Forward<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:-76.3/centery:39.1/zoom:10">https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:-76.3/centery:39.1/zoom:10</a><br /><br />Vessel Schedules of EVER FORWARD <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ss.shipmentlink.com/tvs2/jsp/TVS2_VesselSchedule.jsp?vslCode=FRWD&amp;vslNasme=">https://ss.shipmentlink.com/tvs2/jsp/TVS2_VesselSchedule.jsp?vslCode=FRWD&amp;vslNasme=</a><br /><br />Ever Forward deemed seaworthy, owner questions $100m demand<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://splash247.com/ever-forward-deemed-seaworthy/">https://splash247.com/ever-forward-deemed-seaworthy/</a><br /><br />After 35 days stuck in the Chesapeake Bay, the Ever Forward’s hull is in ‘good’ condition.
