{% raw %}Today it's another fry up challenge...but not just any fry up challenge...a fry up challenge that hundreds of people tagged me in on social media. And with good reason, since if you eat it quick enough, not only is it FREE but you get £50 of vouchers to spend too...assuming you have the quickest time at the end of the month!<br /><br />This thing costs £29.95 to order and consists of 6 sausages, 6 bacon, 6 black pudding, 6 eggs, 6 hash browns, 6 slices of toast, 6 slices of fried bread, beans, mushrooms and tomatoes. Finish it inside 30 minutes and it's on the house, but trump the record time and you're in for the £50 prize too.<br /><br />***NEW VIDEOS EVERY THURSDAY AND SUNDAY AT 7PM UK TIME***<br /><br />FOLLOW ME: Facebook/Twitter/Instagram: @BeardMeatsFood<br /><br />FOLLOW MRS BEARD: Instagram: @Mrs_Beard_Eats<br /><br />MY PODCAST:<br /><br />@BreakingBreadPD - A good old fashioned chin wag with my co-host Josh Gudgeon, in a studio that looks so plush it makes it look like we know what we're doing.<br /><br />MERCHANDISE (DISTRIBUTED BY TEESPRING): <br /><br />Use the merchandise shelf above or the following link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/beard-meats-food-store">https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/beard-meats-food-store</a><br /><br />ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS &amp; ADDITIONAL INFO:<br /><br />Q: How come you don’t get fat? <br />A: I eat like this for 1 hour of a 168 hour long week. In simple terms, I eat at caloric maintenance over the course of time, meaning I don’t gain weight. If you're interested in learning more, see the ‘But How Come You're Not Fat' and 'It Was Just A Normal Day...' videos available on my channel.<br /><br />Q: Don’t you worry about your health?<br />A: Not in particular. I’m active. I eat nutrient dense foods five days a week. And, I get quarterly bloods done, amongst other health checks.<br /><br />BIOGRAPHY, COMMON QUESTION’S AND TRIVIA:<br /><br />See IMDB profile - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8467462/bio">https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8467462/bio</a><br /><br />Music credits to my mate FLORIAN HAACK for the incredible video game metal covers!<br /><br />#FoodChallenge #EatingShow #Breakfast{% endraw %}
