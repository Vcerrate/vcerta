{% raw %}The exodus of staff from Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office has continued after a fifth Downing Street aide reportedly quit.  <br />  <br />The resignations heap further pressure on Mr Johnson, who is already under fire for attending lockdown parties. <br />  <br />The government claims the exodus is all part of Mr Johnson's efforts to “take charge” and “fix” the Downing Street machine as promised in his apology over 'Partygate'. <br />  <br />However, the highest-profile of those departures, the head of policy, was in fact in protest against Mr Johnson's recent behaviour.{% endraw %}
