{% raw %}In the wake of George Floyd’s death, companies are finally feeling the pressure to do something about diversity, equity, and inclusion. We’ve spent over $1 billion on our diversity efforts with remarkably little to show for it. Why? The basic tools of the diversity-industrial complex haven’t worked. In this persuasive talk, Joan C. Williams explains a better, data-driven approach to interrupt bias at work. Over the past 25 years, Joan C. Williams has played a central role in reshaping the conversation about work, gender, and class. She is a Distinguished Professor of Law, Hastings Foundation Chair, and Founding Director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California, Hastings Law. She is one of the 10 most cited scholars in her field and is the author or co-author of 11 books including “What Works for Women at Work” and “White Working Class.” She developed “bias interrupters,” an evidence-based metrics-driven approach to eradicating implicit bias. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
