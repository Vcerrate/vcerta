{% raw %}In this game of Civ 6, I take a look at an up to date version of an AI improvement mod released for Civilization VI – Real Strategy – a mod that promises to beef up the AI in multiple aspects.<br /><br />It promises a lot, from helping the AI to decide on victory types, how to favour great people, aspects of war (including the use of planes and nukes eek) and many other things. I’ve linked the mod below.<br /><br />In order to test the mod properly we’re diving into a HUGE map with India, one of my favourite civs to play in Civ 6, and we’re going to go through a whole game to test the AI out.<br /><br />The question I’m hoping to answer is, “is this the best AI mod in 2022?”<br /><br />All maps, mods and tech support on getting these games to work are available on my discord, so swing by!<br /><br />Real Strategy (AI) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1617282434">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1617282434</a><br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />09:58 - Push!!!<br />10:47 - Peace for now<br />12:12 - Time to build<br />18:44 - Starting to catch up<br />24:25 - Update chat<br />31:06 - Time for coal!<br />34:55 - Oh dear<br />40:25 - Time to gamble on dark<br />43:35 - Azania!<br />50:18 - Incoming rage<br /><br />Make sure you subscribe below so you don't miss more Deity Civilization VI fun!<br /><br />Subscribe - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCEBBOJXdQ3lwoCtYkCnIRQ?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCEBBOJXdQ3lwoCtYkCnIRQ?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />Discord - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/QHB3AM3">https://discord.gg/QHB3AM3</a><br />Patreon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/ursaryan">https://www.patreon.com/ursaryan</a>{% endraw %}
