{% raw %}Meet my husband! In this video, my husband and i sit down and answer your questions! We talk about how we met from his perspective, what it was like for our parents to meet, what he thought of marrying a convert, what his family thought of converts, what languages he speaks, how he feels about my youtube channel, and so much more! He answers openly and honestly on the spot, and I add my own commentary and share stories that help answer the questions more fully. <br /><br />We really enjoyed this q and a, answering your questions to get to know my husband. We even learned a few new things about each other :) thank you for submitting your questions and watching this video! <br /><br />#CouplesQandA #JewishLife #OrthodoxJews<br />__________________________________<br /><br />New video every Monday and Thursday<br />Subscribe now so you don’t miss a thing! <br /><br />Mailing Address:<br />Chana<br />PO Box 795636<br />Dallas, TX 75379<br /><br />Contact / Collab: jaroffirefliesvlog@gmail.com<br />Instagram @jar_of_fireflies<br /><br />Filmed on iPhone 11 Pro Max<br /><br />Don’t forget to subscribe! <br />p.s.
