{% raw %}We stopped by the Simrad display booth at the Miami International Boat Show and got see some incredible technology that is available to the modern boater. Integrated navigation, radar, music and entertainment, all at the touch of a screen button feeding into one unit. The features were incredible and its easy to see we truly have entered a new era in boating. There are so many options available to the modern boater and fisherman, I think we're spoiled. But I can't say I'm up set about it because this technology makes life way easier and more enjoyable on boats.<br /><br />I especially liked the 3d structure scan. This will make finding bottom fishing spots a dream. Just drive your boat on a desired course and watch the sonar and the 3d mapper for hard bottom and ledges, as well as rock piles. Grouper beware, your days are numbered. As soon as I get an offshore boat i'll be adding this technology.<br /><br />visit www.simrad-yachting.com<br /><br />-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-<br />Please watch: &quot;Artificial Lure tips for Tampa winter Trout and Snook&quot; <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-TDsGP18kk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-TDsGP18kk</a><br />-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-{% endraw %}
