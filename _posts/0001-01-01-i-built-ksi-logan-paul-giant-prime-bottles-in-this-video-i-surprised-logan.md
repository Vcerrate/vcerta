Since I have a history of surprising the biggest creators with giant versions of their own products (See ‚ÄúI Built MrBeast a Giant Chocolate Bar!‚Äù), this video seemed like a no-brainer. Only problem was I‚Äôve never actually built something this big made out of plastic...so this was extremely difficult. To make things harder, we heard a rumor that the only time Logan and KSI would be together was in the United Kingdom in 10 days. Because of this, we had to fit the bottles as oversized luggage on an airplane since it was going to cost $60,000 to ship them to the UK. This was an insane journey and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.<br /><br />If you‚Äôre reading this you‚Äôre a real one!<br />Comment ‚Äò‚ÄôDrink Prime!&quot; so I can notice you!<br /><br />Not First Edition Pokemon, But Prime Hydration, But I Started A Drink Company With KSI, But Logan Paul &amp; KSI Go Undercover At Walmart, But Logan Paul vs KSI, But Maverick Club, But Floyd Mayweather, But Logan Paul Car, But Logan Paul Songs, But Logan Paul Giveaway, But Logan Paul Diss Track, But Logan Paul Vines, But Every Day Bro, or any other video like Logan Paul, KSI, Sidemen, Jake Paul, MoreJStu, Stokes Twins, Unspeakable, Dangie Bros, Ryan Prunty, Ben Azelart, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make.
