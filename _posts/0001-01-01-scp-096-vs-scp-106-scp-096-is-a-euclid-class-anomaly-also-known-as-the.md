{% raw %}SCP 096 is a Euclid Class anomaly also known as The Shy Guy.<br />SCP 106 is a Keter Class anomaly also known as The Old Man.<br /><br />SCP-096 is a humanoid creature measuring approximately 2.38 meters in height. Subject shows very little muscle mass, with preliminary analysis of body mass suggesting mild malnutrition.<br />SCP096 is normally extremely docile, with pressure sensors inside its cell indicating it spends most of the day pacing by the eastern wall. However, when someone views SCP-096's face, whether it be directly, via video recording, or even a photograph, it will enter a stage of considerable emotional distress. SCP096 will cover its face with its hands and begin screaming, crying, and babbling incoherently. Approximately one (1) to two (2) minutes after the first viewing, SCP-096 will begin running to the person who viewed its face.<br /><br />SCP-106 appears to be an elderly humanoid, with a general appearance of advanced decomposition. This appearance may vary, but the “rotting” quality is observed in all forms. SCP106 is not exceptionally agile, and will remain motionless for days at a time, waiting for prey. <br />SCP-106 causes a “corrosion” effect in all solid matter it touches, engaging a physical breakdown in materials several seconds after contact.<br /><br />LIKE &amp; SUBSCRIBE to SCP Explained - Story &amp; Animation<br /><br />Watch these other SCP videos we love:<br /><br />SCP-096 - The Shy Guy (SCP Animation)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcNiHBvMWM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcNiHBvMWM</a><br /><br />SCP-106 - The Old Man Escape (SCP Animation &amp; Story)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dHoLU-lWR0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dHoLU-lWR0</a><br /><br />SCP-096 - Look at a Picture of Shy Guy in Space?
