{% raw %}Communities living in the shadow of Northern Ireland's Peace Walls, meeting inspirational people fighting to undo the damage caused by generations of division and hostility.<br /><br />Shot in stunning 4K and narrated by the 2018 Emmy® Award-winning actor Matthew Rhys, this compelling series explores six of the world’s most iconic walls and borders. It features the wall between the US and Mexico, the Korean DMZ, the Israel-Palestine Separation Barrier, the walled communities in Northern Ireland, Cyprus’ Green Line, and the now-demolished Berlin Wall.<br /><br />From the crumbling ruins of ancient walls to brick barriers that are currently under construction, each episode uncovers the human stories behind these walls and asks why they were built, how they affect people’s lives, and what happens when the walls come down. This is a series about hope and unity in the face of division and about the triumph of the human spirit in spite of separation.<br /><br />[Released In 2018]<br /><br />From The Wall Season 1 Episode 4<br /><br />It's like Netflix for history...
