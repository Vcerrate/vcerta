{% raw %}Last August, Kepu Savou thought he had a cold until he continued to get worse, suffering from fatigue and shortness of breath. Doctors found the Des Moines, Wash. man had heart failure. He was rushed to UW Medical Center - Montlake where he waited for four months until he got a heart transplant. At 29 years old, Savou never imagined something like this would happen to him, but it can. Dr. Claudius Mahr, a cardiologist with UW Medicine's Heart Institute, explains heart failure is a growing, all too common issue that affects people of all ages.<br /><br />To recognize the symptoms of heart failure, just remember &quot;FACES&quot;: fatigue, activities limited, chest congestion, edema or ankle swelling, and shortness of breath. If you are concerned, go see a doctor.{% endraw %}
