{% raw %}BOTTOM LINE- buy what you really want; and not what you *think* you need to buy in order to get a rare piece. If you exclusively want a rare piece and have no history with your Rolex AD, your only realistic shot is the secondary market at a mark up. Nearly all Rolex sales associates are happy with that. Welcome to the state of the mad Rolex market. Resellers need not inquire.{% endraw %}
