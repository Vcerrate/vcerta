I've done a lot of work in Silicon Valley, so that's mostly what I talk about. I've raised over 10 rounds of venture capital totaling over $100m in funding.<br /><br />I work mostly in tech-enabled consumer packaged goods, meaning I use software to make the best products possible and then deliver them to the widest possible audience. I'm a big fan of machine learning, python programming, and motion graphics. <br /><br />OTHER VIDEOS:<br />Why Facebook is Spending Billions on the Metaverse - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/QvZSdDC9rWo">https://youtu.be/QvZSdDC9rWo</a><br />The Only Reason SpaceX Works (Gwynne Shotwell) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/K1xWaua-nLI">https://youtu.be/K1xWaua-nLI</a><br />Peter Thielâ€™s Big Bet on Space Manufacturing - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/1FNQ108h8iM">https://youtu.be/1FNQ108h8iM</a><br /><br />CONTACT:<br />You can get in touch with me via Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/johncoogan">https://twitter.com/johncoogan</a><br /><br />Disclaimer: This video is purely my opinion and should not be regarded as a primary source.
