{% raw %}KÃ¼ssnacht is a pretty Swiss town in between Lake Lucerne and Lake Zug as well as at the foot of Mt Rigi. KÃ¼ssnacht belongs to the Canton of Schwyz and has plays a vital role in the history of Switzerland. On this walking tour in spring you get to witness lovely flower arrangements, cherry blossom as well as a mix of quirky architecture in the historic city center! KÃ¼ssnacht is only a stone's throw from Lucerne and best combined with a trip to Mt Rigi.{% endraw %}
