{% raw %}Locker Nuts episode 558<br /><br />In the last episode, I found some outstanding goodies inside the boxes from the big estate buyout I recently made. This episode continues where we left off, looking through boxes for the first time and uncovering surprises. One find in particular knocks me back when I find money that the family left mixed in with toys. WOWZA! This is one of the reasons I love my job. <br />This is part 7 of the &quot;6 Locker Estate&quot; series.<br /><br />Email: lockernuts@gmail.com<br />Mailing address: 12935 Alcosta Blvd. unit 3761, San Ramon, CA 94583<br />eBay Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://stores.ebay.com/gatodeal">http://stores.ebay.com/gatodeal</a><br />***Please don't message me through the eBay store<br />Whatnot auction link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.whatnot.com/invite/lockernuts">https://www.whatnot.com/invite/lockernuts</a><br /><br />Â©2022 JRC &amp; Associates, Inc.
