{% raw %}This video focuses on how I sketch with Procreate on the iPad during the architectural design process. <br /><br />This is just a broad overview, like my first video on Photoshop with the Wacom Cintiq, however my next few videos will be more about specific tools and techniques.<br /><br />Below is a link to Procreate's user manual, but feel free to shoot me any questions in the comments below. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://downloads.savage.si/files/Procreate-User-Guide.pdf">http://downloads.savage.si/files/Procreate-User-Guide.pdf</a><br /><br />And thank you for all of your kind emails after my first video, I wasn't really expecting this much of a response. But it really gives me the drive to devote more time to this.<br /><br />I'll be aiming to get content out (shorter, quick tutorials) more regularly over the coming weeks, stay tuned!<br /><br />Just started an Instagram and Facebook account for DigSketch, will try to post my sketches regularly, would love for everyone to share theirs as well! <br />Tag me: @digsketch  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/digsketch/">https://www.instagram.com/digsketch/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/digsketch/">https://www.facebook.com/digsketch/</a>{% endraw %}
