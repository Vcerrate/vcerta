{% raw %}In the USA, many people are working 2 or more jobs and still living below the poverty line. Families are forced to move their children between motels and city campsites, always afraid of losing the next job - these are the 'working poor'.  <br /><br />Around 15% of the US population live below the poverty line. Since the economic crisis of 2009, over nine million jobs have been created in America. Officially, the recession is over. But American workers have come out of the crisis more vulnerable and even poorer than ever. Meet the people behind America’s economic recovery.<br /><br />Germania has two minimum wage jobs, working 18 hours a day. Three-quarters of her salary goes on paying for the 15m square motel room she shares with her two children and her mother-in-law. But even with two jobs, she struggles to buy food for her family. In the past four months, they have stayed in five motels, moving every few weeks to ever-cheaper rooms as their money runs out.<br /><br />Joe and Chelsie live with their two young daughters in a tent in a church car park.

Like Germania, Chelsie works full time but she can no longer afford to live in the city she works in.<br /><br />Trade Union leader, Scott Slawson, has worked for General Electric for 13 years. But a few days ago, he was told his job will be re-located to a state with no wages and 50% lower salaries.
