His main areas of study are in abnormal, social, and personality psychology, with a particular interest in the psychology of religious and ideological belief and the assessment and improvement of personality and performance.<br /><br />Peterson has bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from McGill University. <br /><br />He was a post-doctoral fellow at McGill from 1991 to 1993 before moving to Harvard University, where he was an assistant and then an associate professor in the psychology department. <br /><br />In 1998, he moved back to Canada as a faculty member in the psychology department at the University of Toronto, where, as of 2019, he is a full professor.<br /><br />Peterson's first book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (1999), examined several academic fields to describe the structure of systems of beliefs and myths, their role in the regulation of emotion, creation of meaning, and several other topics such as motivation for genocide. His second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, was released in January 2018.<br /><br />In 2016 Peterson released a series of YouTube videos criticizing political correctness and the Canadian government's Bill C-16, &quot;An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code&quot;. <br /><br />The Act added &quot;gender identity and expression&quot; as a prohibited ground of discrimination, which Peterson characterised as an introduction of compelled speech into law, although legal experts have disagreed. <br /><br />He subsequently received significant media coverage, attracting both support and criticism. Peterson is associated with the &quot;Intellectual Dark Web&quot;.{% endraw %}
