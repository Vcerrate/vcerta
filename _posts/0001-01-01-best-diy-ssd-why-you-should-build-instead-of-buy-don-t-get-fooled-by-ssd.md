However, they have a couple of issues:<br /><br />#1: They're pretty expensive at around $220-400.<br />#2: They slow down substantially after 20-48GB of storage written.<br /><br />The Custom DIY Portable SSD does not slow down. It runs at full speed and does not overheat! <br /><br />We used the Sabrent Rocket 1TB SSD which is using the brand new  Phison PS5016-E16 SSD controller which is the world's first SSD controller that supports PCIe 4.0 speeds of up to 5,000MB/s read. <br /><br />We combined that SSD with the Trebleet Thunderbolt 3 enclosure that supports speeds of up to 3,000MB/s as well as USB-C 10gbps for maximum compatibility to create the fastest portable SSD you can get your hands on right now!<br /><br />This is great if you need a portable external Thunderbolt 3 SSD for your MacBook, Mac or any PC or computer that supports Thunderbolt 3. <br /><br />If you enjoyed this video, Tap Like &amp; Subscribe for more videos like this one!<br /><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Shop on Amazon ➡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://geni.us/b6e15j">http://geni.us/b6e15j</a><br />Shop on B&amp;H ➡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bhpho.to/2kfoI34">https://bhpho.to/2kfoI34</a><br />Shop on Adorama ➡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2R7qezq">https://bit.ly/2R7qezq</a> <br /><br />10% off unlimited yearly music licensing on Soundstripe (what I use for all my videos) use coupon code &quot;Max&quot; here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://soundstripe.grsm.io/e/6lv">http://soundstripe.grsm.io/e/6lv</a><br /><br />Shot with (Amazon) ➡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://geni.us/viUc7">http://geni.us/viUc7</a><br />Lens (B&amp;H) ➡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bhpho.to/2DZerxL">https://bhpho.to/2DZerxL</a> <br />Mic (Amazon)➡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2tmCVgk">http://bit.ly/2tmCVgk</a><br /><br />If you enjoy our content please consider supporting us on Patreon.
