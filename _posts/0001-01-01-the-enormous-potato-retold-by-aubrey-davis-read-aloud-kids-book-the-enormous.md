{% raw %}The Enormous Potato is a Folk tale that give us hope in which a farmer plants a potato. This potato grows to be so large that he canâ€™t get it out of the ground by himself. He calls his wife for help. She calls for more help, and so on. As each helper comes, the lines are repeated. Once the potato is out, there is enough for the entire village to eat.<br /><br /><br />Please remember to subscribe for more videos!<br /><br />Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linkin.bio/storytimewithlorenzo">https://linkin.bio/storytimewithlorenzo</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/storytimewithlorenzo">https://www.instagram.com/storytimewithlorenzo</a><br /><br /><br />#theenormouspotato #readaloud #kidsbookreadaloud #childrensbooksreadaloud #storytime #storytimewithlorenzo <br />#readaloud #childrensbooks #kidsbooks #readaloudbooks #readaloudsforkids<br />#booksforkids #reading #storybooks #storytimewithlorenzo #owenzo3 #storybooksforkids<br />#readandlearn #storytimebook #readaloudstories #bookworm #raisingbooklovers #picturebooks #readeveryday<br />#readingisfun #readaloudkids #readaloudstory #readaloudkidstories<br />#smartkids #readaloudtime #kidslovebooks #readaloudbooksforkids #readaloudkidstime<br />#childrensbooksreadaloud audiobook homeschooling{% endraw %}
