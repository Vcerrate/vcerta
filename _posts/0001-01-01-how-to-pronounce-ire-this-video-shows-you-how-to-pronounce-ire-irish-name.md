Words’ meaning, dictionary definition, explanation, information.<br />Information &amp; Source<br />Éire (Irish: [ˈeːɾʲə] is Irish for &quot;Ireland&quot;, the name of an island and a sovereign state. The modern Irish Éire evolved from the Old Irish word Ériu, which was the name of a Gaelic goddess. Ériu is generally believed to have been the matron goddess of Ireland, a goddess of sovereignty, or simply a goddess of the land. The origin of Ériu has been traced to the Proto-Celtic reconstruction *Φīwerjon- (nominative singular Φīwerjū Pre-Proto-Celtic -jō). This suggests a descent from the Proto-Indo-European reconstruction *piHwerjon-, likely related to the adjectival stem *piHwer- (cf. Sanskrit pīvan, pīvarī and pīvara). This would suggest a meaning of &quot;abundant land&quot; Wikipedia Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89ire">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89ire</a>{% endraw %}
