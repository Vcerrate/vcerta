What most people do not realize is that money accumulation is rooted in behaviors and habits. Not so-called desire. Fun and interesting statistic. Let's say you were born into a wealthy family OK. Let's say you were stupid. The fact that you were born in a wealthy family is more of a bearing of you being wealthy after growing up than any other factor. So you being smart and growing up poor is like a statical death sentence for future wealth.<br /><br />Unless there are intervening factors.<br /><br />This is what home economics is about. Providing you with those intervening factors. Filling in the knowledge gaps that you have. One of the things that hold you back as you don't know what you don't know. It's like an invisible barrier to wealth development. This is the first of four Modules.<br /><br />So this is how we're gonna proceed with the training. You will get foundation training to build your wealth on brick by brick. No pie in the sky stuff or hope conquers all plays. You will be given statistically proven information and training to help you succeed in life. This is not going to be the flashy things that you see on YouTube this is going to be practical and intentional advice to help you become the person that you want to be.<br /><br />Sign up for Home Economics Here - glendoncameronsschool.teachable.com/p/home-economics{% endraw %}
