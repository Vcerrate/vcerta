{% raw %}WHAT LIES AHEAD? The Word Exposed with Cardinal Tagle (April 03, 2022)<br />Subscribe to JesComTV <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/3qN0biC">http://bit.ly/3qN0biC</a><br />#TheWordExposed #CardinalTagle #Lent #FifthSundayofLent<br /><br />We are on the Fifth Sunday of Lent; and in today’s Gospel, we will hear about the case of “a woman who had been caught in adultery.”<br />The scribes and Pharisees brought the poor woman to Jesus, “so that they could have some charge to bring against him.” But Jesus saw through their motive. He asked them: “Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.”<br />None of the scribes and Pharisees threw a stone at the woman. Jesus then sent the woman: “Neither do I condemn you. Go, and from now on do not sin any more.”<br />Jesus gave the poor woman another chance. This is how God deals with us. This is also how we ought to deal with one another. A new life awaits us.<br /><br /><br />______________<br />The Word Exposed with Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples reflects on Sunday's Mass readings each week. From the Vatican, produced by Jesuit Communications.<br /><br />Please support our Mission.
