{% raw %}Third university project<br /><br />The task was to make a 90 second short film about the topic &quot;Transformation&quot;.<br /><br />In February 2020 I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I never knew how to tell people about my mental health issues. So I took this project as an opportunity to make the movie about my BPD, so I can finally accept this diagnosis, process it and can start healing.<br /><br />Maybe this video can shed a light on this mental disorder. There is nothing wrong with having a mental illness. We should all start to talk more about this topic and raise awareness.<br /><br />Music provided by Free Vibes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/NkGhTg">https://goo.gl/NkGhTg</a><br />Dream Away by Day 7: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/day7official/dream-away">https://soundcloud.com/day7official/dream-away</a><br />Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported (CC BY-ND 3.0)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/</a>{% endraw %}
