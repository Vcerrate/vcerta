He forgot about her until later, in an accident in which a young boy was injured; and after verification, it was confirmed that the little boy, Wu Tong Tong is indeed his son.<br /><br />In order to gain back his son, Li Zhongmou takes Wu Tong to court and tries to win the custody of the boy. However, later, due to his lack of maternal love as a child, he does not want his son to grow up the same way, so he agrees to share custody with her. As time goes on, touched by Wu Tong's intimate relationship with their son and her kindness, Li Zhongmou finds himself falling for Wu Tong. However, Li Zhongmou's rival and half-brother, Xiang Jun (Denny Huang) also begins to fall in love with her.<br /><br />Eventually, Li Zhongmou and Wu Tong marry, but they are unable to tell others because of opposition by their families. After experiencing life and death, resentment and prejudice, everyone eventually learns to understand, trust and love. Li Zhongmou and Wu Tong overcome misunderstandings that threaten to ruin their relationship and from separation find their way back to each other.<br />★Starring: Jerry Yan / Tong Liya / Feng Jing /
