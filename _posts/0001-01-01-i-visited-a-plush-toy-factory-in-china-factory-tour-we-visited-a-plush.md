{% raw %}We visited a plush toy factory in Dongguan China, the manufacturing process of making a plush toy is more complicated than I expected. They make plush toys for many celebrities and characters . Can you point out who you saw in this video?<br />The first step is the design of the toy. And it is impressive how the designer can use the 2D-design and turn it in to 3D by using their brain without any computer. <br />Then pick the material or clothes to make the toy . The factory not only tests the weight of the material but also the color fade of the material.<br />After the clothes are checked, they will be sent to the cutting areas to cut into different shapes to make the parts of the plush toy. Sometime they will use the laser cutter to cut the pieces for the smaller order. <br />Sometimes the plushie has certain shapes and patterns, so they use heat transfer or embroidering . The process of slow motion is absolutely amazing. <br />Then the next step of making a plush toy would be sewing all the pieces together and inject cotton into the plush toy to make it plushie! I had so much fun making all these plushies! <br />It is pretty much done . All you have to do is to sew the last part together and go through the final test before sending it to all the kids around the world!<br />I think all toys are unique and different in its own way. Its not only made by machines but also the hearts of all the workers. <br />If you want to make your own plushie toy, shoot us a email at machinaind1@gmail.com. We can help you contact the factory and make it happen!<br />#Factory tour #plush toy #how its made #plush toy factory in China{% endraw %}
