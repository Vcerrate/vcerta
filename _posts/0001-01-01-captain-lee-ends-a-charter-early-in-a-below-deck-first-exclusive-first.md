In the past five years, he has done some serious growing up and is ready to show his crew what it takes to be a great Bosun. But yachting is not all fun and games—will this veteran prove he is up for the challenge, or will he decide this is his final sail? <br /><br />CAST:<br />Lee Rosbach<br />Eddie Lucas<br />Rachel Hargrove<br />Francesca Rubi<br />Isabelle Wouters<br />James Hough<br />Shane Coopersmith<br /><br />GET MORE BRAVO:<br />Follow Bravo: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bravo.ly/Twitter">http://bravo.ly/Twitter</a><br />Like Bravo: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bravo.ly/Facebook">http://bravo.ly/Facebook</a><br />Follow Bravo on Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV">https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV</a><br />Bravo Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bravo.ly/Instagram">http://bravo.ly/Instagram</a><br />Bravo Tumblr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bravo.ly/Tumblr">http://bravo.ly/Tumblr</a><br /><br />Bravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.
