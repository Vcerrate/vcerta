{% raw %}Since the year 2017, SP500 did almost 100%. So how is it possible that 90% of investors lost money during that same time. The truth is, that the stock market is somewhat of a pyramid scheme, where 10% of investors make almost 100% of the profits, while the rest lose. <br /><br />I am making this video because I don’t want to see people lose their hard earned money over stupid mistakes. I have no magic formula nor a paid course to teach you 100% way to not lose, but I can show you some common mistakes that are killing your portfolio and are easy to avoid. <br /><br />👏👏 Big shout out to our growing list of Patreons.
