{% raw %}Kunnon rässiä eikä mitään ostariheviä<br /><br />Hell with you, I'm broken free, a salivating nightmare<br />In my time of hibernating all your sins I had to bear<br />Through dreams of a bitch of Amsterdam I've arrived to spread my terror<br />A virus in your IBM, forever-lasting syntax error<br /><br />Break the spell with so-called knowledge<br />I'm a killing vicious itch<br />You can't even scratch<br /><br />Time and weather are working for me<br />Soon you will all be history<br />Spoiled in your youth when my threat was unknown<br />Now you're feeling a chill in your backbone<br /><br />Can you still recall the cold and frosty night so long a time ago<br />You heard that silent whispering and asked your mother if she would know<br />I was there, not capable of anything but I did await<br />Now I'm here and once again this world must pay for the dinner it ate<br /><br />You may well cry out your brain<br />But nothing more you will obtain<br />Man must pay for the catastrophy<br /><br />You are just creeping lice<br />Worthy of only hate and despise<br />I must see you die<br />I must see you victimized<br /><br />Fly away, canary, but can't you see?<br />I'm not after you, I just fullfil written prophecy<br />Does it make a difference if it's me or someone else<br />Now cleaning patrols are storming the barbed wire fence<br /><br />Resurrection, mass infection<br />Follow mating call, empire's fall<br />Turbid stare born to defy<br /><br />Paris, Rome and Hannover<br />All sober to suffer a hangover<br />Sleep! Wake!{% endraw %}
