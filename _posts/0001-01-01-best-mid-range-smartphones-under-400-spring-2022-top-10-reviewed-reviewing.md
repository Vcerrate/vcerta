{% raw %}Reviewing the best mid-range Android smartphones of Spring 2022, for a budget of £400 and under. From the Samsung Galaxy A53 5G and Xiaomi's Redmi Note 11 Pro Plus to the Google Pixel 5a (ahead of the 6a launch). These are my favourite budget-friendly mid-range phones you can buy in the UK!<br /><br />If you're after an even cheaper handset, check out my reviews and round-ups of the greatest Androids under £300 and £200 too.<br /><br />Coming up with my top 10 was quite tricky this far into 2022. Manufacturers like Google, Samsung, Xiaomi and Realme all offer a selection of compelling smartphones at a mid-range asking price. The fresh Galaxy A53 is lovable, although the gaming performance isn't as good as last year's A52s, so you may be tempted to look back instead.<br /><br />The Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro Plus is a bit of a mouthful but also a great smartphone, boasting impressive specs for a budget-friendly cost. For less cash you can also grab the Note 11 and regular Pro (check out my full comparison).<br /><br />Then there's the Oppo Find X3 Lite (Find X5 Lite review hopefully coming soon), OnePlus Nord 2 and Realme's excellent 9 Pro Plus. So many to consider, so which is your personal favourite?<br /><br />Best Mid Range Smartphones 2022 Chapters:<br />0:00 - Talky start bit<br />0:54 - Pixel 5a &amp; 4a<br />2:29 - OnePlus Nord 2 &amp; PacMan<br />4:02 - OnePlus Nord CE 2 5G<br />5:07 - Oppo Find X3 Lite<br />6:44 - Poco F3<br />8:32 - Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro Plus 5G<br />9:47 - Samsung Galaxy A53<br />11:46 - Realme GT Master Edition<br />13:02 - Realme 9 Pro Plus{% endraw %}
