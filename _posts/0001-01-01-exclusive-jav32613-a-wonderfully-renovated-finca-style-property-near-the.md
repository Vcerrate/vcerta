{% raw %}Charming rustic property in a superb, tranquil location between the villages of Pedreguer and La Xara, near to the Marriott La Sella Golf resort and spa. <br /><br />This wonderful property has excellent road access, then electric gates open up to the sweeping driveway through the immaculate gardens. There is a double car port and plenty of off-road parking. <br /><br />The emblematic, large wooden doors then open up to the heart of the home; a large South facing terrace with 3-arch stone naya. The naya offers the main entrance to the house, which was completely renovated in 2014. <br /><br />The great room offers an office space, large living area with feature fireplace and stunning picture windows with integrated blinds, a dining area with table for 8 guests and a modern, open-plan kitchen with central island and integrated Siemens inox appliances and gas stove. From the great room is the corridor to the sleeping area, with a separate WC for guests, spacious master suite with large built-in wardobes and modern en-suite shower room, plus a guest suite with en-suite shower room and lovely views over the gardens. <br /><br />Adjacent to the kitchen is the dual height garage / utility room, with access to the third bedroom and en-suite shower room. This space could easily be converted into additional accommodation or to create another living area. <br /><br />There is also a very large workshop with an adjacent glazed naya which could be converted into a separate guest apartment with a summer kitchen. <br /><br />The exterior of the property is equally as impressive, with an 8x4m south facing pool with sunken lounge beds, pool cover, and pre-installation for a heat pump. A wooden meditation hut, orchard with lemon, orange, avocado, apple, kumkwat, pear, fig, mandarin, grapefruit, caqui and limequat trees. There is also a greenhouse with heating, agricultural water supply and cover: perfect for keen gardeners. <br /><br />Practical extras to note are: underfloor gas central heating, double glazing throughout, air conditioning in the master bedroom, kitchen, living room and workshop, mains and agricultural water supplies, double car port, electric entrance gates and alarm system.{% endraw %}
