{% raw %}Why don’t more men choose to work part-time? Why don’t more men do an equal share of housework and childcare?   Natacha Catalino explores how society's norms shape the way men and women share home responsibilities, and how engrained beliefs from our media and upbringing shape how we share (or not!). <br /><br />The intro animation was produced as a collaboration between TEDxBasel and the Hochschule Luzern. This animation was created by Loïc Kreyden and Valentine Moser.  <br /><br />Find out more about this event and the other ideas that were shared at www.tedxbasel.com  &quot;Leadership development consultant, mother of four, wife, and global nomad, Natacha has spent the past ten years seeking her version of “having it all.” Professionally, Natacha is an economist by training, and has worked for McKinsey for more than 13 years, focusing on helping others to be at their best through leadership development and culture transformation.  At home, Natacha has four daughters who have lived as global citizens, in England, Switzerland, China and Turkey. As part of a dual-career couple, she has varied her work/home balance from 0% to 100%, currently working 52.5%. To hold it all together, she loves yoga, meditation, tennis, and long walks.<br /><br />Favourite quote: &quot;&quot;Yesterday I was clever so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.” ―Rumi&quot; This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
