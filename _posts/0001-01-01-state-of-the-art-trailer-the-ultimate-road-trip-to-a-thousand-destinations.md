{% raw %}The ultimate road trip, to a thousand destinations, for one unforgettable exhibition. In 2013, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art’s curatorial team hit the road to investigate what’s happening in American art today. Over the course of a year, the team logged more than 100,000 miles, crisscrossing the United States to visit nearly 1,000 artists whose work had not yet been fully recognized on a national level.<br /><br />The result of this unprecedented journey was a one-of-a-kind exhibition, State of the Art: Discovering American Art Now, featuring 102 artists and 227 artworks. On view at Crystal Bridges from September 13, 2014 - January 19, 2015, the exhibition will be hitting the road in 2016-17 to wow new audiences. Come along as filmmakers Craig and Brent Renaud share the stories of some of the artists involved in this groundbreaking exhibition.<br /><br />Airways Freight Corp. is the official shipper of State of the Art.{% endraw %}
