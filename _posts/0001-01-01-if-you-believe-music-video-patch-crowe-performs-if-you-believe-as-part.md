{% raw %}Patch Crowe performs 'If You Believe' as part of the 2021 Youth Music Festival.<br /> <br />If you believe, you can move the highest mountains,<br />Cross the greatest oceans,<br />And walk across the water—<br />The water.<br />1. You feel defeated,<br />Falling on your knees and<br />Looking up for some hope tonight.<br />You try to stand up,<br />But you throw your hands up<br />Like you no longer have the strength to fight<br />’Cause you’ve seen too many sunsets,<br />Too many days<br />Ending in the darkest night.<br />But on your own you’ll<br />Never know, you’ll<br />Never know.<br />If you believe, you can move the highest mountains, Cross the greatest oceans,<br />And walk across the water—<br />The water.<br />Believe you can move the highest mountains,<br />Cross the greatest oceans,<br />And walk across the water.<br />If you believe.<br /> <br />2. They say that all you need is faith,<br />But it’s almost like you lost your way,<br />Took a few wrong turns<br />Took a few breaks.<br />Falling behind now,<br />Looking for grace<br />’Cause you need someone to lift you up.<br />Make right all the things you done<br />’Cause on your own you’ll<br />Never know, you’ll<br />Never know.<br />If you believe, you can move the highest mountains, Cross the greatest oceans,<br />And walk across the water—<br />The water.<br />Believe you can move the highest mountains,<br />Cross the greatest oceans,<br />And walk across the water.<br />If you believe.<br />If you believe.<br /> <br />3. You can do anything.<br />You can do anything.<br />You can do anything<br />If you believe.<br />If you believe, you can move the highest mountains, Cross the greatest oceans,<br />And walk across the water—<br />The water.<br />Believe you can move the highest mountains,<br />Cross the greatest oceans,<br />And walk across the water.<br />If you believe.<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to the Youth Channel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for the latest videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Ws96cP">https://bit.ly/2Ws96cP</a><br /><br />Follow us on INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2WIggKr">https://bit.ly/2WIggKr</a><br />Listen on SPOTIFY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/3eAcM2G">https://spoti.fi/3eAcM2G</a><br />Listen on APPLE MUSIC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/2CJ1Y4M">https://apple.co/2CJ1Y4M</a><br />Visit us on our WEBSITE: www.ChurchOfJesusChrist.org/youth{% endraw %}
