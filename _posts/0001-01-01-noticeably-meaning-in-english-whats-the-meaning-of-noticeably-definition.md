The word's part of speech reveals its meaning and grammatical function in the context of the sentence. When employed in various contexts, a single word may operate as more than one element of speech. In order to correctly define a word in a dictionary, you must know the components of speech.<br /><br /><br /><br />Noun: When we use the word &quot;noun,&quot; we're referring to a person or a location or an object or an idea or a quality.<br /><br />Pronoun: The pronouns I, you, he, she, it, we, they, I, myself, this, that, who, which, and everyone serve as noun substitutes and nouns.<br /><br />Verb: The verb in a phrase conveys a sense of activity or existence. A primary verb is used, and one or more supporting verbs may also be used. &quot;She's a talented singer.&quot; There are two verbs here: sing and can.) Number agreement between verb and subject is required in every sentence (both are singular or both are plural). Tense may also be expressed via the use of distinct verb forms.<br /><br />Adjective: A noun or a pronoun is modified or described by an adjective. It generally responds to the query of which one, what sort, or how many there are. (Usually, articles [a, an, the] are categorised as adjectives.)<br /><br />Adverb: Adverbs describe or modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, but never nouns. It generally responds when, where, how, why, under what circumstances, and to what extent. Adverbs often end in -ly.<br /><br />Preposition: A preposition is a word that comes before a noun or pronoun in order to build a phrase that modifies another word or phrase. As a result, a preposition is always included in a prepositional sentence. Almost usually, the prepositional phrase serves as an adjective or an adverb.<br /><br />Conjunction: A conjunction connects two words, phrases, or sentences and expresses the link between them. Coordinating conjunctions join grammatically equivalent elements: and, but, or, not, for, so, and yet. Because, although, while, since, and other subordinating conjunctions link sentences that are not equal: because, although, while, since, and so on. Other sorts of conjunctions exist as well.<br /><br />Interjection: Interjections are words that are used to communicate emotion. It is often followed by an exclamation mark.<br /><br />The meaning and the translation is taken from the Google Translate which internally uses Oxford Dictionary.
