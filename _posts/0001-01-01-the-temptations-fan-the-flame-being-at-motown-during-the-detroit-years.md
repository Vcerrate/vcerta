{% raw %}Being at Motown during the Detroit years was a magical and certainly memorable time in my life.  Being able to be close friends and/or work with on a daily basis such great talent like Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, The Four Tops, The Supremes, Martha Reeves &amp; The Vandellas, Stevie Wonder, The Isley Brothers, The Marvelettes, Jimmy Ruffin, David Ruffin, The Funk Brothers (James Jamerson, Robert White, Uriel Jones, Earl Van Dyke, Jack Ashford, Eddie &quot;Bongo&quot; Brown, Johnny Griffith, Joe Messina, Eddie Willis), Harvey Fuqua, Johnny Bristol, Bobby Taylor &amp; The Vancouvers, Edwin Star, Blinky and so many more, was truly an honor in my life.  Those memories of laughing together at mistakes on the take or in the voice, creating and making music, producing something out of a raw idea, is what keeps me creating today.  It didn't matter if it was 3am, when the idea came to us, we would drive and meet each other at the studio and start laying it down.  There was a strong creative force happening in that small house in Detroit, and nothing could stop it, and who would want to.  <br /><br />Pamela Sawyer and Gloria Jones, were among the many other great song writers at the Motown Label.<br /><br />Check out The Flamingos' YouTube Channel for more: <br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtrPD9QhOIvBE_UNFEgrsYQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtrPD9QhOIvBE_UNFEgrsYQ</a><br /><br />Connect with Terry:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.terryisaiahjohnson.com">https://www.terryisaiahjohnson.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/terryisaiahjohnson/">https://www.instagram.com/terryisaiahjohnson/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TerryIsaiahJoh1">https://twitter.com/TerryIsaiahJoh1</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TerryIsaiahJohnsonMusic">https://www.facebook.com/TerryIsaiahJohnsonMusic</a> <br /><br />Connect with The Flamingos:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://theflamingos.com">http://theflamingos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/theflamingos/">https://www.instagram.com/theflamingos/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheFlamingos">https://twitter.com/TheFlamingos</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TerryJohnsonsFlamingos">https://www.facebook.com/TerryJohnsonsFlamingos</a>{% endraw %}
