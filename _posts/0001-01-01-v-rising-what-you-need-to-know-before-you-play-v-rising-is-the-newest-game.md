This RPG/survival hybrid  is really fun to play and i hope you like the features it brings to the table!<br /><br />#vrising <br />#survival <br /><br />Game Details &amp; Info:<br /> <br />V Rising is a vampire survival game for the PC, played out in a gothic open-world, containing a mix of exploration, building, crafting, and action-packed combat. Rise from your coffin as a newly-awakened vampire, stripped from your former powers, fight for survival and strive to dominate the land of the living. Play solo or create a clan with up to three friends as you build your castle, hunt for blood in nearby villages, and wage war against your enemies. The world of V Rising is inhabited by both NPCs and players, offering PvP and PvE challenges. You will need to power up your character by obtaining unholy abilities, crafting armor and weapons. You will also need to strengthen your castle while the threat from other players is rising. <br /><br />- A Gothic Open-World: Explore a vast world teeming with mythical beings and danger. Travel through lush forests, open countryside, and dark dungeons to discover valuable resources, meeting friends and foes alike along the way. Traverse the world with vampire comrades or hunt solo as you pillage villages, raid bandits, and wander into the domains of supernatural beasts.<br /><br />- Fear the light - Rule the night: Stick to the shadows during the daytime, or the burning sunlight will turn you to ashes. Roam the night and prey on your victims in the darkness. As a vampire, you must quench your bloodlust and plan your strategies around the day/night cycle.<br /><br />- Raise your Castle: Gather resources and discover ancient techniques to gain dark powers. Use your newly acquired knowledge to build a castle where you can store your loot and grow your army of darkness. Personalize your domain, exhibit your vampiric style and make sure to craft coffins for servants and friends. Strengthen your castle while the threat from other players is rising.<br /><br />- Compete or Cooperate: Travel alone or explore the world with friends. Fighting side by side with other vampires will give you an advantage in your battle against the strongest creatures and most powerful humans. Raid other players’ castles or play the diplomat in the game of blood, power, and betrayal. Compete or cooperate - the choice is yours.<br /><br />- Master your Vampire: Learn and master an arsenal of deadly weapons and unholy abilities. In V Rising, you aim skill-shots and dodge projectiles using​ precise​​ ​WASD controls ​and cursor-based​ ​aiming - no click to move. Tailor your play-style by combining melee or range weapons with a variety of powerful spell kits. Master your skills and unleash your wicked powers.V Rising is a vampire survival game for the PC, played out in a gothic open-world, containing a mix of exploration, building, crafting, and action-packed combat.
