{% raw %}Of all the videos I have made, this is one of them.<br /><br />0:00 - Intro<br />0:24 - Mar'Sara Missions<br />1:41 - Smash and Grab<br />2:10 - The Evacuation<br />2:36 - The Devil's Playground<br />3:25 - Outbreak<br />4:08 - Welcome to the Jungle<br />4:55 - The Dig<br />5:19 - Whispers of Doom &amp; A Sinister Turn because the chapter system doesn't let you have chapters less than 10 seconds and I already had to condense mar'sara. Thanks youtube, why don't you just trust me to make my own decisions about chapter length? For some reason you are totally fine with the TITLES of the chapters being an arbitrary length. If you bring the chapter selection up on the right hand side and hover over this chapter name you get an entire freaking book written to you, but I can't make them sub 10 seconds? Is this really more okay than the idea that maybe Whispers of Doom isn't that hard? Is YouTube a Whispers of Doom Stan? How pathetic.<br />5:38 - Echoes of the Future<br />5:59 - In Utter Darkness<br />6:21 - Ghost of a Chance<br />6:50 - The Great Train Robbery<br />7:58 - Cuttthroatt<br />9:02 - Haven's Fall<br />9:56 - The Moebius Factor<br />11:05 - Supernova<br />11:59 - Maw of the Void<br />12:36 - Engine of Destruction<br />14:04 - Media Blitz<br />14:29 - Piercing the Shroud<br />15:45 - Safe Haven<br />16:40 - Those Darn Gates<br />17:32 - Belly of the Beast<br />18:27 - All-in<br />20:51 - How Much Have I Improved?{% endraw %}
