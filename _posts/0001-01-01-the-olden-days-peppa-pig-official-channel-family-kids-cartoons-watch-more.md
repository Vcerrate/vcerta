She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.<br /><br />George Pig<br />George is Peppa’s little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa – even when she’s being bossy. George’s favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can’t speak yet but can say one word very well: ‘Dine-saw!’<br /><br />Mummy Pig<br />Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don’t bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.<br /><br />Daddy Pig<br />Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can’t remember where he put his glasses.<br /><br />Have fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel! <br /><br />✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨<br /><br />#Peppa #PeppaPig #PeppaPigEnglishepisodes #PeppaPigEnglish #PeppaPigSongs #Nurseryrhymes #Kids <br /><br />PEPPA PIG © ASTLEY BAKER DAVIES LTD/ENTERTAINMENT ONE UK LTD 2003.<br />Peppa Pig created by Mark Baker and Neville Astley.{% endraw %}
