{% raw %}Sermon Overview<br />Scripture Passage: 1 Peter 3:1-7<br /><br />God designed the divine institution of marriage and has given us the tools to create blessed homes. In 1 Peter 3, there are seven words that can build a marriage and cultivate success in the home.<br /><br />One: Faith: “For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, being submissive to their own husbands...” (1 Peter 3:5).<br />A three-fold cord is not easily broken; likewise, a marriage made up of a man, a woman and God is difficult to break.<br /><br />Two: Acceptance: “Wives, likewise, be submissive to your own husbands, that even if some do not obey the word, they, without a word, may be won by the conduct of their wives, when they observe your chaste conduct accompanied by fear” (1 Peter 3:1-2).<br />Man and woman are equal in worth before God, but they do not serve the same function. Once we accept our God-given roles, we will receive the blessing of a harmonious marriage.<br /><br />Three: Contentment: “Do not let your adornment be merely outward… rather let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit...” (1 Peter 3:3-4).<br />Like true character and beauty, contentment is inward. Both husbands and wives must learn contentment within the home, but even more, within themselves.<br /><br />Four: Forgiveness: “Finally, all of you be of one mind, having compassion for one another; love as brothers, be tenderhearted, be courteous...” (1 Peter 3:8).<br />We must learn to forgive one another, releasing the grudges and the burden of bitterness.<br /><br />Five: Communication: “He who would love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit” (1 Peter 3:10).<br />Marriages function based on communication; it is crucial to learn how to communicate with your spouse.<br /><br />Six: Romance: “Husbands, likewise, dwell with them with understanding, giving honor to the wife…” (1 Peter 3:7).<br /><br />The physical part of our marriages cannot grow cold; we must dwell together, showing consistent admiration and honor to one another.<br /><br />Seven: Prayer: “...and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered” (1 Peter 3:7).<br />Spouses must learn to pray with and for each other. Adrian Rogers often repeated the adage, “The family that prays together, stays together.”<br /><br />Apply it to your life<br />We are not perfect people, and we will not have perfect marriages. But if we build our homes upon these seven words, our love will flourish.<br /><br />-<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If you would like more information, please visit our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.lwf.org/">http://www.lwf.org/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />  Follow on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/lwfministries">https://twitter.com/lwfministries</a><br /><br />  Follow on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lwfministries/">https://www.instagram.com/lwfministries/</a><br /><br />  Like on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/lwfministries">https://www.facebook.com/lwfministries</a><br /><br />  Youtube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/lwfministries">https://www.youtube.com/lwfministries</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Write to us:<br /><br />Love Worth Finding Ministries<br /><br />P.O.
