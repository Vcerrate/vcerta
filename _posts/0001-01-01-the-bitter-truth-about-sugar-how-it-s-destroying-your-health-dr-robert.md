The food industry has done this on purpose to keep you coming back for more. <br /><br />Here’s the thing: The liver can innately process a small amount of sugar packaged in a real food, like a piece of whole fruit. But when it comes to large amounts in our food supply—and regularly eating lots of concentrated fructose in particular—we are poisoning our liver and mitochondria, and severely disrupting our microbiome. <br /><br />Today on The Dhru Purohit Podcast, Dhru talks to Dr. Robert Lustig about the real dangers of eating too much sugar and how to take better care of our metabolic health.<br /><br />Dr. Lustig is a neuroendocrinologist with expertise in metabolism, obesity, and nutrition. He’s the Emeritus Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Endocrinology and a member of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at UCSF. He is also one of the leaders of the current “anti-sugar” movement that is changing the food industry, in part through his game-changing books. His latest work is Metabolical: The Lure and the Lies of Processed Food, Nutrition, and Modern Medicine.<br /><br />Also mentioned in this episode:<br /> - The Metabolic Syndrome Pathways poster - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://robertlustig.com/metabolic-syndrome-signaling/">https://robertlustig.com/metabolic-syndrome-signaling/</a><br /> <br />For more on Dr. Robert Lustig, follow him on Facebook @drrobertlustig, Twitter @robertlustigmd, YouTube @robertlustig, and through his website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://robertlustig.com/.">https://robertlustig.com/.</a> Get his book, Metabolical: The Lure and the Lies of Processed Food, Nutrition, and Modern Medicine at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3C57WYF.">https://amzn.to/3C57WYF.</a><br /><br />For more on Dhru Purohit, follow him on Instagram @dhrupurohit, Facebook @dhruxpurohit, Twitter @dhrupurohit, and YouTube @dhrupurohit.
