{% raw %}What are the benefits to using Behemoth for DPS?<br />1. High sustain damage<br />2. Uncomparable Tankiness<br />3. Powerful neutral game<br />4. Build-crafting<br />5. Easy and consistent buff-stacking<br /><br />Break your own crystals in super to give yourself High Energy Fire and Font of Might at the same time, this works in solo and team content. Since you're using your super for a solid chunk of the damage for longer you're saving more ammo for longer encounters. Useful for Master Raids or situations like Rhulk's final stand.<br /><br />Mods:<br />Font of Wisdom<br />Font of Might<br />Elemental Charge<br />High Energy Fire<br />Elemental Shards (Stasis){% endraw %}
