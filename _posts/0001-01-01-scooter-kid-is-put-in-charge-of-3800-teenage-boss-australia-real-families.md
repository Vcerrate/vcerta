{% raw %}Hosted by Australia's star mathematics teacher, Eddie Woo, follow 15 teenagers from across Australia, as they take charge of the family budget.<br /><br />Host and buoyant mathematician Eddie Woo challenges 13 year old Vasanth to budget frugally for his mother Sathya, dad Shan and bigger brothers Ananth &amp; Jayanh. For the next month the youngest in this Indian-Australian family is in charge of the decisions and $3850 in cold, hard cash.<br />But with great power comes great responsibility. All Vasanth wants to do is upgrade his scooter. If he had his way there were be scooter parks every 2 km and no more cars. Sounds good to me.<br />If he is to get that scooter upgrade he will have to save some costs, but will it mean fewer family take-aways, less money on entertainment &amp; outings and cuts to the groceries? <br /><br />The big question: is there enough left in the case to upgrade that scooter?<br /><br />Real Families brings you stories of modern day family life from around the world through the eyes of children, parents, and parenting experts. <br />Subscribe for weekly documentaries and full episodes of evergreen family documentaries and parenting TV shows. <br /> <br />Subscribe for more from Real Families: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/y8WzCa">https://goo.gl/y8WzCa</a><br /> <br />Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RealFamilies/">https://www.facebook.com/RealFamilies/</a><br /> <br />Check us out on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/realfamilieschannel/">https://www.instagram.com/realfamilieschannel/</a><br /> <br />Weâ€™re on TikTok too: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@realfamilies">https://www.tiktok.com/@realfamilies</a><br /><br />Content Licensed by DRG to Little Dot Studios <br />Any queries, please contact us at owned-enquiries@littledotstudios.com<br /><br />#RealFamilies #TeenageBoss #Parenting{% endraw %}
