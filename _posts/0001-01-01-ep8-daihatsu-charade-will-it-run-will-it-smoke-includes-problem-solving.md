{% raw %}Turns out 'sleeping on it' is sometimes a very good idea! We fix the oil pressure light, rather unexpectedly, so will it now run? This is our engine swap on a 2006 Daihatsu Charade (Cuore/Mira) L251 that is probably an entirely pointless undertaking, but we're doing it anyway.<br /><br />MERCH!
