{% raw %}Prof. Dr. Ulrich Reinhardt's Talk, &quot;Leisure Time 3.0 or What We Really Like to Do&quot;, at TEDxBerlin 2012 &quot;Future 3.0&quot;.<br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
