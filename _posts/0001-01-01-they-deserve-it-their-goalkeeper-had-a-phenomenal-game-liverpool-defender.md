{% raw %}Andrew Robertson, Liverpool defender (asked about the loss to Madrid)<br />&quot;I think the team that ends up with the trophy is the team that deserves to win. They took their chances, their chance, and we didn't. Their goalkeeper had a phenomenal game. We had some really big chances that we should have taken. I don't really remember, other than the offside goal, to have many chances other than the goal they scored but that's Real Madrid for you. They don't panic. If you look at all the knockout games they've been in, probably every one of them is very similar. I watched the Man City game against them and Man City were really comfortable until 87, 88 minutes. Fair play to them, they've won the trophy, they deserve it, we need to try and pick ourselves up from it.&quot;{% endraw %}
