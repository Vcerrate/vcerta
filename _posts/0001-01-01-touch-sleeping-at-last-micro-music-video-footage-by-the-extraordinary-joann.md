{% raw %}Footage by the extraordinary, Joann Boswell (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/joannreneephotography/)">https://www.facebook.com/joannreneephotography/)</a> - &quot;Touch&quot; is from the Sleeping At Last album,  &quot;Atlas: Senses&quot; - get it here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2xxEGc4lJ7cKvOtOdvxByn">https://open.spotify.com/album/2xxEGc4lJ7cKvOtOdvxByn</a><br /><br />What's a &quot;Micro Music Video&quot;? A tiny, simple and hypnotizing video accompaniment to my songs. Rather than seeing a static image, I loved the idea of having a visual to get lost in while listening.<br /><br />When will I feel this <br />As vivid as it truly is, <br />Fall in love in a single touch, <br />And fall apart when it hurts too much?<br /><br />Can we skip past near-death clichés<br />Where my heart restarts, as my life replays? <br />All I want is to flip a switch <br />Before something breaks that cannot be fixed.<br /><br />I know, I know- the sirens sound <br />Just before the walls come down. <br />Pain is a well-intentioned weatherman <br />Predicting God as best he can, <br />But God I want to feel again.<br /><br />Rain or shine, I don’t feel a thing, <br />Just some information upon my skin. <br />I miss the subtle aches when the weather changed, <br />The barometric pressure we always blamed.<br /><br />All I want is to flip a switch <br />Before something breaks that cannot be fixed.<br /><br />Invisible machinery, these moving parts inside of me <br />Well, they’ve been shutting down for quite some time, <br />Leaving only rust behind.<br /><br />Well I know, I know- the sirens sound <br />Just before the walls come down. <br />Pain is a well-intentioned weatherman <br />Predicting God as best he can, <br />But God I want to feel again, <br />Oh God I want to feel again.<br /><br />Down my arms, a thousand satellites <br />Suddenly discover signs of life.{% endraw %}
