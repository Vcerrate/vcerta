{% raw %}Happy Friday! I hope everyone has had a fantastic week. Dollar Tree did not disappoint this week. Lots of great new items. I was particularly happy to find chicken wire, and a few of the spring decor items. I fell in love with the gnomes, cactus glassware, the pastel pillar candles, AND the jewlery. <br /><br />I'll list the stores here for anyone in DFW area that would like to know what stores I visit each week. <br />1250 William D. Tate Suite 400 Grapevine 76051<br />820 MacArthur Blvd. Suite 125 Coppell 75019<br />3924 Teasley Lane Denton 76210 ( my favorite store)\<br />2305 Colorado Blvd. Denton 76205<br />1038 W.
