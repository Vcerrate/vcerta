{% raw %}Rescue of a homeless dog with a broken leg - Howl Of A Dog Rescue Video www.HowlOfADog.org We were driving back home from the veterinary clinic when we spotted an injured dog limping on side of the road. We pulled over and rushed toward him, trying to stop him from going any further into the thick bushes. He was so desperate and the moment he saw us he seemed to have instantly realized we’re there to help him. We took him to the clinic to be examined and have an X-ray performed, but the results received were not good: he had a double fracture - the two bones of his front leg were broken and needed repair surgery. The vet estimated the fracture was at least one week old. Vlad was also severely emaciated, we can only imagine how hard it was for him to survive for so many days without food and with that painful broken leg. He was so hungry when we found him that he desperately grabbed a box of tissues we had in the car and tried to eat them.<br />He underwent repair surgery and the fractured bones were fixed with metal plates and screws. The procedure was a complicated one, but everything went well and Vlad made a beautiful recovery. Vlad is a young dog, approx. 2 years old, he’s neutered, microchipped and fully vaccinated. He’s full of joy and finds so much fun in everything he does. He really loves life and longs to find a home where he can live happy and smile for the rest of his life. He is in our care in Romania but can also travel abroad to the USA, Canada and Europe. So if you have a loving home for him please check our adoption procedure here: www.howlofadog.org/adoption-procedure/ and email us at contact@howlofadog.org . Thank you!<br /><br />*UPDATE: We’re so happy to announce you that Vlad found a loving adoptive family in Phoenix, Arizona: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.howlofadog.org/vlad-adopted-in-the-united-states">https://www.howlofadog.org/vlad-adopted-in-the-united-states</a> .Thank you so much everyone for your support, for watching and for sharing his rescue video!<br />***Check out this new video of Vlad at his forever home: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/HmfYFo8LfzU">https://youtu.be/HmfYFo8LfzU</a> (the video also includes updates on other dogs that we rescued and got adopted into loving homes) <br /><br />**The dog that was with us in the car when we found Vlad is Archie whom we saved several weeks earlier.
