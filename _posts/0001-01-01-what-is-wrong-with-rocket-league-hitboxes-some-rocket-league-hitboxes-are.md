{% raw %}Some Rocket League hitboxes are quite odd. Many of the new ones don't line up at all with how the car appears visually. In this video, I take a deeper dive into which cars are most messed up and why Psyonix might have made these choices.<br /><br />My Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/wayton">https://www.twitch.tv/wayton</a><br /><br />My Links<br />‣ Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/32Yp5zb">https://discord.gg/32Yp5zb</a><br />‣ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/WaytonPilkin">https://twitter.com/WaytonPilkin</a><br />‣ Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/wayton">https://www.twitch.tv/wayton</a><br />‣ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/waytonpilkin">https://www.instagram.com/waytonpilkin</a><br /><br />CHECK OUT MY ROCKET LEAGUE COURSE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gamersrdy.com/product/ultimate-guide-to-teamwork-in-rocket-league/r/paytonwilkin/">https://www.gamersrdy.com/product/ultimate-guide-to-teamwork-in-rocket-league/r/paytonwilkin/</a><br /><br />Bakkesmod in Rocket League has a plugin that allows you to see how your hitbox actually lines up with each car. A few days ago, I looked at this for the first time and noticed some pretty interesting things about hitboxes in Rocket League that I didn't notice before. Many of the hitboxes for cars such as the Ford-F150, Formula 1, and some of the NASCAR cars seemed to be misplaced or misaligned or even put in the completely wrong hitbox category. Today, I tested if that even matters. The results I got from my experiment were pretty interesting. A channel that takes a more scientific dive into Rocket League hitboxes that I would recommend checking out is Rocket Science on YouTube.<br /><br />Production music from Epidemicsound.com<br /><br />Use Creator Code: WAYTON<br />Thanks to Epic Games and Psyonix for the creator code.<br /><br />:){% endraw %}
