{% raw %}Narrated by Academy Awards winner Jeremy Irons, Heal the Bay's &quot;mockumentary&quot; video shows the stark reality of California's plastic bag pollution situation. Heal the Bay, alongside a coalition of environmental and public health experts, pushed the State of California to pass a ban on single-use plastic bags: Prop 67 passed on Nov 8, 2017. But this plastic waste reduction legislation is only the beginning. Heal the Bay is on a mission to ban all single-use plastic.<br /><br />If you like this video, don't forget to donate to our nonprofit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://healthebay.org/donate">https://healthebay.org/donate</a><br /><br />Read more about our latest coverage on plastic pollution: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://healthebay.org/category/plastic-pollution/">https://healthebay.org/category/plastic-pollution/</a>{% endraw %}
