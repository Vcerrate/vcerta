{% raw %}I grabbed the pop-up canopy from our river trip and I stuck it on the back of the SUV for a night of camping. Overall a very functional idea for tailgate tenting, but it will take some tweaks to make it a bit more airtight. Early spring camping doesn't get any better than this!{% endraw %}
