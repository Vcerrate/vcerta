{% raw %}Emerging research suggests that one of the best things you can do for your career and personal well being is to take extended time off your job. Entrepreneur DJ DiDonna speaks about his own sabbatical, and discusses his research on how sabbaticals can play a transformational role in how we think about ourselves, and the future of work itself. Dennis [DJ] DiDonna has dedicated his career to commercializing social science research to create organizations that positively impact the world. DiDonna founded The Sabbatical Project in 2018 to explore when and why sabbaticals lead to positive outcomes for working professionals. DJâ€™s research is funded by collaborator Professor Matt Bloom with the Wellbeing at Work initiative at the University of Notre Dame and the Templeton Foundation. Along with Professor Ashley Whillans at Harvard Business School, The Sabbatical Project is now exploring role and effects of companies in making sabbatical policies mainstream. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
