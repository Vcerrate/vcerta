{% raw %}In Last week's episode Jesse met his new dad. In today's episode Jesse and Trevor Wallace open up a flower shop and sell some flower! Designs by David in Mid-City were kind enough to host as the doobie duo dedicate their minds and lungs to selling medicinal grade flowers to unsuspecting customers at an actual flower shop. Valentines day never felt so weird as the two deal buddha and quips in a hotboxed designer bouquet shop. <br /><br /><br />Want to be in season 4 of Sh*thole? <br /><br />Leave the funniest comment down below and like the video and you could get flown out to LA for Season 4!<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO FULLSEND FOR NEW VIDEOS EVERY SUNDAY:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNbp...">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNbp...</a><br /><br />FOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM:<br />MTVJESSE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/mtvjesse">https://instagram.com/mtvjesse</a><br />SH*THOLE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/shithole">https://instagram.com/shithole</a><br /><br />VISIT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fullsend.com/">https://fullsend.com/</a>{% endraw %}
