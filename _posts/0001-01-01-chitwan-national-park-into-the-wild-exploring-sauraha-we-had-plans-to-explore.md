{% raw %}We had plans to explore  Chitwan National Park and for having wildlife photography to stay away from the cold of Kathmandu for some time. With a three-day trek, we planned to capture the wildlife and greenery of the national park.<br /><br />   We managed to catch a lot of things that came in our sight and we missed those things because we couldn't find them. We have captured as much as we can and present you today through this stuff today. In short, our purpose was somehow served, but when we returned ,we came back with sweet and deep memories, the bliss of which is different.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Know something about the National Park:<br /><br /> Chitwan National Park is Located in south-central Nepal, this 932 square kilometre (360 square mile) area is actually Nepal's first national park and was the first protected area in the country. It was declared a national park in 1973 — then at 543 square kilometres (210 square miles), before expanding in 1977 — and was made an official UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984. Almost a half-century later, the park continues to flourish, making it one of Nepal's most popular and unmissable tourist attractions.<br /><br />If you are a wildlife enthusiast, then Chitwan National Park is the place we should not miss to visit in Nepal. Chitwan National Park is very famous for Wildlife Safari, Bird Watching, and Tiger Tracking in Nepal. Thousands of tourists visit Chitwan National Park in a year and fall in love with nature.
