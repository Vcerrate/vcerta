I have seen each episode already growing up, so these reviews are to compare and contrast the five categories listed below.<br /><br />PLOT (Scaled from 1 to 5 Points)<br />The foundation of the episode. Uniqueness and overused tropes are taken into account, but it is also judged on how well it tells the story of the episode. An episode can score a 5 even with a basic/ cliche plotline as long as it has good pacing, worthy use of its tropes, and feels well-polished. An episode can lose points due to plotholes, uneven storytelling, and relying too heavily on cliches to do the work for it. <br /><br />CHARACTERIZATION (Scaled from 1 to 5 Points)<br />How well the characters are written. Do they feel like themselves compared to the grand narrative of the franchise? Are the supporting or one-off characters interesting, or pure plot devices? Did the humor land? Did the actions and character motivations make sense?<br /><br />VISUALS (Scaled from 1 to 5 Points)<br />Basically, everything that happens on-screen. Character Design. Animation. Backgrounds. Creative mechanics and solutions. If there is CGI or digital effects added, how well do they blend into the show, and were they used as an enhancement, or a crutch? <br /><br />IMPORTANCE (Scaled from 1 to 5 Points)<br />This includes, but is not strictly based on, how important the episodes are to the current story arc (if there is one) or the general narrative of the Ben 10 Franchise. Points can also be awarded for how impactful the episode was, or how favored/ important it is to the general Ben 10 fanbase. I ask myself, &quot;If I skipped this, would I be missing out on the 'Ben 10 Experience?' &quot;<br /><br />ENTERTAINMENT (Scaled from 1 to 5)<br />Pretty much the most important part of developing a tv show. You can be perfect in all four of the previous categories, but the episode can still be boring. On the flip side, the episode can be absolute garbage, but still an enjoyable watch. How likely would you be to put this episode on if you were in the mood to watch Ben 10?{% endraw %}
