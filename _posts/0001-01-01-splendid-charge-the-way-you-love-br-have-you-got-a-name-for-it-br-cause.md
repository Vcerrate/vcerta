{% raw %}The way you love<br />Have you got a name for it?<br />'Cause I don't understand it<br />Language is an annoying necessity<br />And I depend on all the regular things<br />Got a list tattooed on my memory<br />Of how our tryst should unfold<br /><br />I'm falling from the opposite<br />What good is it?<br />Fight the map with no key attached<br />My heart's enlarged and I charge<br /><br />What do you say<br />To a dream that won't go away?<br />'Cause I don't know if I can stand it<br />Forever isn't something you want to be<br />And I rely on familiar things<br />Seven days all have special meanings<br />But you just call it a week<br /><br />I'm falling from the opposite<br />What good is it?<br />Fight the map with no key attached<br />My heart's enlarged, and I charge<br /><br />The night is young<br />And the moon is a mother to both of us<br />We both understand this<br />Marriage is an old and tired religion<br />And I love all the traditional things<br />Domestic bliss and all that shit<br />Confusion is a definite direction{% endraw %}
