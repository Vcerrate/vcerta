He has explored many countries in Africa including Ghana, Kenya, Namibia to name a few. In this video we will have a discussion with Nii about making a decision to  move to settle in one African country and what he will take into consideration in making that decision. We will also get know him a bit better. <br />Nii's youtube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOhiR-6Y-MZtMERKRENrcRw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOhiR-6Y-MZtMERKRENrcRw</a><br />Intagram: Goblack2africa<br />Website: www.GoBlack2Africa.com <br /><br />Subscribe to my channel here : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/jjasminesw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/jjasminesw?sub_confirmation=1</a>   <br />Natural Skin and Hair Care Site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lusciousskinandhair.com">https://www.lusciousskinandhair.com</a>  (WORLDWIDE SHIPPING)<br /><br />0.00 Intro<br />1:32 where have you come from? <br />2:02 How did you end up in Ghana?<br />3:17 What African countries have you travelled to so far?<br />3:40 Which African country has been your most favourite and then your least favourite and why?<br />5:16 Do you have any plans of settling anywhere?<br />6:04 How have you prepared for your travels around Africa ?<br />6:28 Is it expensive to travel around Africa<br />7:03 Have you had any challenges while travelling around Africa?<br />8:23 Why I chose to invest in Ghana?<br />9:02 what do you love about Ghana?<br />10:03 Why all African Americans must reconnect to Africa<br />11:46 How did you end up with an African name?<br />14:50 Whats your favourite African food?<br />16:54 Outro<br /><br />Email: jjasmine.ama@gmail.com (Business enquiries)<br /><br />To Donate: <br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/JasmineAma">https://www.patreon.com/JasmineAma</a><br /><br />Mobile Money +233593865963  NO CALLS<br /><br />P.O.BOX BT 83, TEMA, GHANA <br /><br />T shirts and other New Merchandise <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/jasmine-amas-store">https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/jasmine-amas-store</a> <br /><br />YOUTUBE OPTIMIZATION TOOL I USE <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.Tubebuddy.com/JASMINEAMA">https://www.Tubebuddy.com/JASMINEAMA</a> <br /><br />Camera <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3qMNYuz">https://amzn.to/3qMNYuz</a> <br />Microphone <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/30xx486">https://amzn.to/30xx486</a> <br /><br />Instagram: jasmineeama<br />Second Channel:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqQbELg3vizmCepLTn1dt9Q?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqQbELg3vizmCepLTn1dt9Q?sub_confirmation=1</a> <br />Natural Skin and Hair Care instagram: @lusciousskinandhair <br /><br />My name is Jasmine and I have relocated from Sydney Australia to Ghana in west Africa as of the year 2020. <br />My parents are of Ghanaian descent and so am I although I was born in Australia. Here on my channel, my goal is to give you a real glimpse into what its like to live in Ghana, from the Ghanaian food, to the Ghanaian culture, to the Ghanaian lifestyle and everything in between. My goal is to satisfy your curiosity about Ghana and help inspire to explore Ghana. <br />My prayer is that these videos do just that for several Africanâ€™s in the diaspora. <br /><br />Follow your bliss because life is short, follow your bliss because human life has no intrinsic value, follow your bliss because everything happens for the greater good and follow your bliss because it has all happened before.{% endraw %}
