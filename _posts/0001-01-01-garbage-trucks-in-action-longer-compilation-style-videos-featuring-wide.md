{% raw %}Longer compilation-style videos featuring wide varieties of trucks have always seemed to be among my most popular work, a fact which seems to be holding even more true in recent years. To keep up with popular demand, it seems that now is the time to unleash the next installment in the compilation series!<br /><br />To those who follow my uploads regularly, you will see that the vast majority of the trucks featured here have never been seen before, most of which will have their own feature video at some point down the road, so keep an eye out for your favorites!<br /><br />This installment features perhaps the most broad range of collection equipment yet, filmed in five different states over the past several months! Included are several commercial and residential rear-load and front-load trucks, a plethora of automated side loaders, a curbside recycling truck, a manual side loader, a mini side-loader from the 1970's, and even an appearance from the legendary Crane Carrier Integrated Rear Loader - or perhaps better known simply as the CCC IRL! There truly is something for everybody in here! For those new to my channel, this is wonderful sampler of what you can expect to see here, and for my devout subscribers, consider this a taste of things to come! I hope you all enjoy this latest installment of the &quot;Mega Compilation Series&quot;!
