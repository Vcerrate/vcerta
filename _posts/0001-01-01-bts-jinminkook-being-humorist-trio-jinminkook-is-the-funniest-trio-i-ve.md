{% raw %}Jinminkook is the funniest trio I've ever seen, and they're always a laugh! One of the many reasons we adore them is because they are naturally interesting and entertaining. They're all a little crazy in their own way, as if they're tormenting each other. Jimin, on the other hand, is fed up with Jinkook, the middle child who sits by and watches the older and younger siblings be brats to one other.<br /><br />#bts #ë°©íƒ„ì†Œë…„ë‹¨ #é˜²å¼¾å°‘å¹´å›£ #2022 #chaotic #funny #jinminkook #humorist #trio #funniesttrio <br /><br />About: <br />Hello, everyone!
