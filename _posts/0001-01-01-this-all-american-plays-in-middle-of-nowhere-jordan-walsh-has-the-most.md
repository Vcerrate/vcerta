We linked with Jordan Walsh, one of the most versatile players in the Class of 2022. Jordan moved from Texas to a small town in Missouri to hoop at Link Academy, and he's been absolutely INSANE this year. Jordan is that GUY!! He can take you off the dribble, pull up from 3, or absolutely posterize you. He said there's no better feeling than getting his team hype when he SLAMS it down on a fast break!! Jordan is also doing big things representing the Alopecia community. We know it's only up from here all love to our guy Jordan ❤️<br />---------------------------------<br />Follow Us...
