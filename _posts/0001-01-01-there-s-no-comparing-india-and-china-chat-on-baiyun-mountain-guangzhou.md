{% raw %}I have a conversation with an Indian man who's been living in China for 8 years. He said he wants to die on Chinese soil. Find out why this guy loves China so much and listen as he compares these 2 great nations.<br /><br />This is really just a conversation and not an interview. I put the word interview in the thumbnail because I didn't know how else to describe this video in one word. But conversation is really what it is.{% endraw %}
