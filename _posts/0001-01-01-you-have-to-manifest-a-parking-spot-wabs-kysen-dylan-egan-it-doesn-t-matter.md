{% raw %}Wabs, Kysen, Dylan, Egan. It doesn't matter if you get there early or late, there's nowhere to park. Really fun set up though. On the drive up, visualize yourself pulling into the lot just as that Honda Element's tail lights come on in front of you and cruise in there. You have to manifest a parking spot. I heard they are taking out 3 Kings lift. Why would they do that? I guess they just don't care, we aren't making them any money anyway. Kysen can never keep his hat on. Dylan can't keep his shirt on either. I can't remember how to ski. Whenever you get the camera out, Egan goes crazy. Dude you smell really bad. Yeah I worked til close bro. I have powerful pheromones. Did you bring sunscreen? Maybe we could park at 7/11. I don't want to get towed though. We're so busy at the rental shop that we literally ran out of poles. Alright, I have to work at 5. Haha yeah I got demoted to busser for going on the street trip without getting my shifts covered. The kid that wears the full neon green outfit rules. I wore the wrong socks. I asked Kevin Bane if I could pay him to teach me how to do a cork 7 and he said yes. How do we open up our own resort?<br /><br />vishnufreeski.com<br />songs: pass the peas by the j.b.'s<br />             drums please by dj manny and dj rashad{% endraw %}
