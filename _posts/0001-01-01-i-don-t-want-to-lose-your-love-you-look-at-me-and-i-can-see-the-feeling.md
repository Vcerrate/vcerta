{% raw %}You look at me and I can see the feeling's gone, <br /><br />What happened to the dream we plan our future on? <br /><br />You turn away and try to say what we both know, <br /><br />But baby, I can't let you go... Let you go away! <br /><br />'Cause... <br /><br /><br /><br />I don't want to lose your love, <br /><br />I don't want to be the one who's broken hearted, <br /><br />Don't take the only love I've ever known! <br /><br />I don't want to lose your love, <br /><br />How could you go and stop what we have started? <br /><br />Oh, baby, I don't want to be alone! <br /><br /><br /><br />I try to hide the hurt inside so plain to see, <br /><br />I never could keep secrets from you anyway. <br /><br />So hard to face, I can't erase the thought of you, <br /><br />Oh baby, won't you change your mind? <br /><br />Change your mind and stay? <br /><br />'Cause <br /><br /><br /><br />I don't want to lose your love, <br /><br />I don't want to be the one who's broken hearted, <br /><br />Don't take the only love I've ever known! <br /><br />I don't want to lose your love, <br /><br />How could you go and stop what we have started? <br /><br />Oh, baby, I don't want to be alone! <br /><br /><br /><br />I don't want to lose your love, <br /><br />I don't want to be the one who's broken hearted, <br /><br />Don't take the only love I've ever known! <br /><br />I don't want to lose your love, <br /><br />How could you go and stop what we have started? <br /><br />Oh, baby, I don't want to be alone! <br /><br /><br /><br />I don't want to lose your love, <br /><br />I don't want to be the one who's broken hearted, <br /><br />Don't take the only love I've ever known! <br /><br />I don't want to lose your love, <br /><br />How could you go and stop what we have started? <br /><br />Oh, baby, I don't want to be alone!{% endraw %}
