{% raw %}Thanks to @19Bozzy92  and @Italiansupercarvideo for their incredible footage of classic Ferraris! Check out their channels to see their raw footage in full! <br /><br />The semi automatic gearbox - or paddle shift as it is also known - is one of the most significant technological developments in F1 history. <br />In just a handful of years after Ferrari introduced the concept in 1989, every car on the grid had copied it. It’s a system we all take for granted today, and it’s even made its way into the road car industry.<br />But the pioneering car that first carried this revolution almost got derailed by spectacular internal politics at Ferrari. <br />As we get into this story we hope you like the footage we’ve included, and we’d like to give a huge thank you before we get going to 19Bozzy92 and Italiansupercarvideo for allowing us to use some of the incredible stuff they have shot. Please check out their channels to marvel at their incredible raw footage in full.<br /><br />#F1 #Formula1 #Ferrari<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://the-race.com/youtube_subscribe">http://the-race.com/youtube_subscribe</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://the-race.com/">http://the-race.com/</a><br />Twitter: @wearetherace<br />Instagram: @wearetherace<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/wearetherace">http://facebook.com/wearetherace</a><br />Podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://the-race.com/podcasts">http://the-race.com/podcasts</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching - please like, share and comment, please also hit subscribe to show your support so we'll keep doing what we're doing.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.the-race.com">https://www.the-race.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/wearetherace">http://www.twitter.com/wearetherace</a>{% endraw %}
