It's not that he can't, he simply doesn't have to or doesn't want to. It's not what you think... just hear me out. Let's look at ways Messi has been insane this season,  because while he may not be scoring as much, he's contributing in a much bigger way something nobody is really talking about, but I'm here to to bring respect to the man. Don't doubt Messi just yet.
