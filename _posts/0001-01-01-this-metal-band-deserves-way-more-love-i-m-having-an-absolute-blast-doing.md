{% raw %}I'm having an absolute blast doing these mini one-man-band covers so figured I'll keep them coming until you guys get sick of them 😂. Nevermore have always been one of my favorite bands, especially the This Godless Endeavor album, so thought I'd play something from them next! The song's called &quot;Born&quot;, taken from the aforementioned album. What a freakin' sick chorus! 🤘<br /><br />📷 Instagram ⮞ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bradleyhallguitar">https://www.instagram.com/bradleyhallguitar</a><br /><br />❤️ Support ⮞ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3mI3dDFrZ5PHFPx1H0TCvQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3mI3dDFrZ5PHFPx1H0TCvQ/join</a><br /><br />💬 Discord ⮞ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/bradleyhallguitar">https://discord.gg/bradleyhallguitar</a><br /><br />🎧 Spotify ⮞ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1GWEEM9mY6XkkF17uaWU3j">https://open.spotify.com/artist/1GWEEM9mY6XkkF17uaWU3j</a><br /><br />🎸 Fiverr ⮞ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fiverr.com/beanleyhall">https://www.fiverr.com/beanleyhall</a>{% endraw %}
