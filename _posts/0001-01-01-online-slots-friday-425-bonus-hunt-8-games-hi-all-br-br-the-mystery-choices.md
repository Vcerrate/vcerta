{% raw %}Hi All,<br /><br />The mystery choices bonus hunt yesterday finished with a pleasant profit.  It was as expected really, with the majority of mysteries returning duds, but fortunately a couple did fire.  The main reason for making a profit was managing to obtain them cheaply in the first place, on another day it could have been a big loss.<br /><br />I will continue to try the mystery choices in the hope of one day hitting a massive win.  For today, I am back to a mix of new games, favourites and requests.  There were a couple of no bonuses along the way, with Poseidon megaways and Legacy of Ra megaways the worst offenders.  I did quit them earlier than normal today, so the damage isn't too severe.<br /><br />In the end, I have settled for 8, having spent £425 on this selection:<br /><br />Tiki Runner 2 doublemax<br />Pirate Kingdom MW<br />Sticky Sevens MW<br />Power of Thor<br />Genie MW<br />Millionaire MW<br />Book of Tut<br />3 Clown Monty<br /><br />I hope you have enjoyed the extra videos this week.  I have enjoyed playing over the last few sessions, hence the additional footage.  I will have a break tomorrow but may well put something up once again on Sunday.  Enjoy the weekend until then.<br /><br />#onlineslots #slots #bonushunt{% endraw %}
