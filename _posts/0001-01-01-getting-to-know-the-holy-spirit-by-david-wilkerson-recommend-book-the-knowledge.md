It is rather a expression of a heart burden to see the Church revived and brought back to holiness, purity, and power with God. &quot;The mission of SermonIndex is the preservation and propogation of classical vintage preaching and the promotion of genuine biblical revival to this generation.&quot;<br />#Jesus #Sermons #Sermon <br /><br />Affiliate Disclosure:<br />As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.{% endraw %}
