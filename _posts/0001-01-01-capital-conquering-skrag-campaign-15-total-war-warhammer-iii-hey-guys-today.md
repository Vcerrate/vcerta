{% raw %}Hey guys! Today we're feeding our appetite for more Total War: WARHAMMER II with a brand new Ogre Kingdoms campaign featuring Skrag The Slaughterer! We're ditching the main campaign (though Skrag is technically supposed to be competing in the main objectives) in favour of figuring out where the Empire is hiding all those Halflings (Spoilers; They're not in this game). I hear they're great at cooking and we're plenty hungry! Enjoy :)<br /><br />Creative Assembly have given me these tasty Affiliate Links for TW titles &amp; DLC's which give me a mighty 15% revenue share;<br />Total War: WARHAMMER 3: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.xsolla.com/CvVeZh9I">https://link.xsolla.com/CvVeZh9I</a><br />Total War: WARHAMMER 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.xsolla.com/wLc2INHm">https://link.xsolla.com/wLc2INHm</a><br />Total War: WARHAMMER 1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.xsolla.com/nPAbYqoT">https://link.xsolla.com/nPAbYqoT</a><br />A Total War Saga: TROY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.xsolla.com/WID3hPkl">https://link.xsolla.com/WID3hPkl</a><br />ROME: Remastered: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.xsolla.com/GU8rvAk2">https://link.xsolla.com/GU8rvAk2</a><br /><br />The link to my curated store on nexus.gg is especially exciting for TWW3 launch week.
