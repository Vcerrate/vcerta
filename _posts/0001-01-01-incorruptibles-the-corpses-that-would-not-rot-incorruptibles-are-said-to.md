{% raw %}Incorruptibles are said to be people whose earthly remains are unaffected by the natural processes of decomposition. Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox belief states that divine intervention can cause this phenomena, and take it as a sign of the person’s holiness.<br /><br />In some instances, wax masks based upon imprints are placed on the bodies for public viewing. This is due to the fear that the occasional blackish tinge on the face and sunken eyes and nose might be viewed as corruption by the public.<br /><br />Music used: “Spirit of Fire” by Jesse Gallagher<br /><br />Check out my other channel for future Curiosity Vault videos!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZvRnQrxVnrxPwpZIG9P39g">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZvRnQrxVnrxPwpZIG9P39g</a><br /><br />#Incorruptibles #Saints #CuriosityVault{% endraw %}
