{% raw %}I play a Magic the Gathering Online Legacy league with Mardu Aristocrat Tokens, a deck from Patreon subscriber DragonDayDragon. This deck goes SUPER wide with Young Pyromancer, Sedgemoor Witch, and Lingering Souls with lots of sweet spells to sacrifice those creatures for fun and profit! With a little Chain of Smog combo to boot!<br /><br />Decklist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4728781#paper">https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4728781#paper</a><br /><br />Find the cards you need and support this channel on TCGplayer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3rCeF79">https://bit.ly/3rCeF79</a><br /><br />Try this deck yourself on MTGO with the Cardhoarder loan program: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cardhoarder.com/">https://www.cardhoarder.com/</a><br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:52 Deck Tech<br />8:13 Round 1<br />30:03 Round 2<br />44:40 Round 3<br />52:41 Round 4<br />1:06:18 Round 5<br />1:30:33 Final Thoughts<br /><br />Business inquiries: boshnrollstream@gmail.com<br />Youtube Membership: Hit the &quot;JOIN&quot; button below the video!<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/BoshNRoll">https://www.patreon.com/BoshNRoll</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/BoshNRoll">https://www.twitter.com/BoshNRoll</a><br />Merch store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://boshnroll.creator-spring.com">https://boshnroll.creator-spring.com</a><br />Podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.TheEternalGloryPodcast.com">https://www.TheEternalGloryPodcast.com</a><br />All these links again: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/BoshNRoll">https://linktr.ee/BoshNRoll</a><br /><br />Want me to try YOUR favorite deck?
