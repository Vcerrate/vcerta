{% raw %}In this week's film I'm throwing and trimming a rather large stoneware bowl. As I'm currently in a making cycle it'll just show the making of the form, all the glazing and firing is yet to occur. I've left in quite a spectacular blooper too that you might like.<br /><br />If you'd like to see what I'm up to on a daily basis you can follow me over on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/floriangadsby/">https://www.instagram.com/floriangadsby/</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />0:00 - Introduction<br />0:15 - Preparing clay<br />0:41 - Bowl blooper (well worth a watch)<br />2:05 - Throwing the bowl<br />5:52 - Indenting the bowl's rim<br />8:40 - Trimming the bowl the day after<br />13:20 - Hollowing up the foot ring<br />15:38 - Stamping my maker's mark<br /><br />I throw using a Rohde HMT500 potter's wheel and for the most part use Bison trimming tools.
