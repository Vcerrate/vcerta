{% raw %}Being part of the Kardashian Jenner inner circle is a big deal! The only downside is that once you’re out, you’re out! This family knows how to cut ties for GOOD.<br /><br />These stars had a chance at being part of the Kardashian and Jenner inner circle - but they blew it. Former friends, colleagues, and celebs like Larsa Pippen, Jordyn Woods, Pia Mia, Justine Skye, Sofia Richie, and Monica Rose all found themselves on the outs. Others like Brittny Gastineau, Amber Rose, Drake, Blac Chyna, and Taylor Swift couldn’t stay on these stars’ good sides! We’re just glad we’re not the ones who felt the Kar-Jenner wrath first hand!<br /><br />From exes to Bffs to stylists and fellow celebs, there’s nobody the Kardashians won’t feud with and cut off if the situation calls for it. Our best advice? Stay on these ladies’ good sides - or be cast out of the inner circle forever! <br /><br />Do you think these ex-friends deserved to be cut out?
