Apply it and life will begin to change according to YOUR order. When you use Transurfing goals are not reached, so much as realized for the most part of themselves.<br /><br />It seems impossible to believe but only at first. The ideas presented in the book have already received practical confirmation. Those who have tried Transurfing, experience surprise bordering on delight as the world of the Transurfe, inexplicably changes before their very eyes. What is the book about? Transurfing is the art of controlling reality using our freedom of choice. The world always reflects our perception of it.<br /><br />People can choose any variant of the development of current reality and thereby find themselves in circumstances they find desirable. To learn how to do this, you have to learn how to establish mutual understanding between the soul and mind.<br /><br />✨  Reality Transurfing TV<br /><br />#RealityTransurfing #Transurfing #Reneegarcia{% endraw %}
