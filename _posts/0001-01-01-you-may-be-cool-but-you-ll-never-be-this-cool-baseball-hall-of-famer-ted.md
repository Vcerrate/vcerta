{% raw %}Baseball Hall of Famer Ted Williams flew 39 combat missions as a Marine Corps Panther pilot during the Korean War. Half of those were with future NASA Mercury 7 astronaut John Glenn as his flight lead.<br /><br />This classic photo shows Williams describing part of one missions with Glenn sitting at the table next to him - two American icons joined in a time of war. Williams would return to the Boston Red Sox and become one of the greatest hitters of all time, and Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth before retiring from NASA and serving as a U.S. Senator from Ohio.{% endraw %}
