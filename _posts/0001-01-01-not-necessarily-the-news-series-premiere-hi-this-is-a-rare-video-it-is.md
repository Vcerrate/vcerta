{% raw %}Hi. This is a rare video. It is the first episode of the HBO comedy series &quot;Not Necessarily The News.&quot; This episode was not the pilot episode from September, 1982. It is the first regular episode with the familiar original cast (Anne Bloom, Danny Breen, Rich Hall, Mitchell Laurance, Audrie Neenan &amp; Stuart Pankin). This episode introduces several popular features of the show including: sight gags in the lavatory, highway slapstick with background music, funny footage with politicians and the introduction of SNIGLETS (Words that should be in the dictionary but aren't).<br /><br />Last but not least, Audrie Neenan introduces her news anchor character Jacqueline Pennel, and Stuart Pankin introduces his character, the chief anchorman of NNTN; Bob Charles. Additionally, Stuart does his first skit as &quot;Lenny Slatkin&quot;, the president's joke writer. Truly a rare gem in cable television. First telecast on HBO on January 3, 1983.<br /><br />Enjoy :){% endraw %}
