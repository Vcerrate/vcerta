We provide community projects, training and consultancy combining speech and language therapy expertise, music, creativity and fun. All designed to teach better ways of including and empowering people with understanding or speaking difficulties.<br /><br />The Include Choir is the musical voice of Include.org.<br /><br />· The Include choir uses video as a way of spreading the word about inclusive communication- and sharing the #WeTalkMakaton Sign of the week (which can be great for a giggle). This is a great way to learn skills, as well as enjoying singing and performing together.<br /><br />· Anyone can join. Members include people with and without communication needs. Everyone is valued for their unique contribution.<br /><br />· Our members get involved in writing songs as well as performing and we use music as a tool for inclusion and learning about a range of topics, including the Mental Capacity Act.<br /><br />Why not join the Makaton community? When signing and singing, the signs may not always be 100% accurate. To learn Makaton and truly include people, why not book on to one of our courses - email info@include.org<br />#WeTalkMakaton #Inclusion #SLT{% endraw %}
