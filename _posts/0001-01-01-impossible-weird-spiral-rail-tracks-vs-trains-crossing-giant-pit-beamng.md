Our soft-body physics engine models every component of a vehicle in real time, resulting in realistic behaviour. The simulation effectively recreates the exhilaration of real-world driving thanks to years of exact design, hard study, and competence.<br /><br />Websites: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.beamng.com/game/">https://www.beamng.com/game/</a>{% endraw %}
