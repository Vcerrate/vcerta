{% raw %}This is an informative video about the NLAW next generation anti tank system. It uses a predictive guidance system to track enemy tanks and lock onto them. I'm your average infantryman Chris Cappy here to examine my top favorite relatively new anti-tank weapon system. Historically since WW2 soldiers have preferred to travel the battlefield within the safety of an armored vehicle but all that is changing now as tanks are becoming giant sitting ducks. How does it feel now that the tables have turned! The hunter becomes the hunted! <br /><br />#NLAW #MISSILE #WAR{% endraw %}
