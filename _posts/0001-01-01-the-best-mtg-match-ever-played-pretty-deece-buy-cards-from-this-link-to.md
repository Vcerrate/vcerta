There are unsleeved dual lands. There are beads instead of dice. And—inexplicably—a Beanie Baby. Above all else it is the story of one player who refused to lose and another who refused to win. Fate tried to intervene, but both of these men told fate to go pound sand. This is—without a doubt—the greatest match of Magic: the Gathering ever played.<br /><br />Written and performed by Jon Corpora<br />Directed and produced by Isaiah Sheppard<br />Sound and design by Justin Ward<br />Script supervision by Angela Freeman{% endraw %}
