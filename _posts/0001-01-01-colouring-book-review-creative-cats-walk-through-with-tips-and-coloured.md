{% raw %}My walk through of Marjorie Sarnat's amazingly popular colouring book 'Creative Cats' complete with a number of pages I've coloured using different mediums.  Creative Cats is one of the long list of colouring books printed by Dover Puplications under their Creative Haven lines.  I discuss the paper quality of 'Creative Haven' books as well as talking about how different colouring mediums will perform on this paper and a few ideas you may like to try with your own books.<br />For more information and general colouring fun please visit my blog at:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.la-artistino.com">http://www.la-artistino.com</a><br />If you are enjoring my videos please consider becoming a patron through my Patreon account  which you can access at my blog.  Even tiny amounts mount up and every little bit helps me to keep producing these videos. :){% endraw %}
