{% raw %}This season's Haute Couture collections were a little bit stagnant. So we obviously had to give them a review. Schiaparelli disappointed the house's founder Elsa, Iris Van Herpen explored crazy neurons, and Dior obviously sucked, even when Maria Grazia has good reference points. Chanel took us on a journey of the orphanage where Coco grew up, and Givenchy was a nice display of simple yet effective couture. We then got into Valentino's tight little collection, and bid adieu to the fashion legend Jean Paul Gaultier, as he will no longer be designing for his eponymous label. <br /><br />Social Media:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hautelemode/">https://www.instagram.com/hautelemode/</a><br />Personal Style: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hautelemess/">https://www.instagram.com/hautelemess/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/HauteLeMess">https://twitter.com/HauteLeMess</a><br /><br />Fashion Victims Podcast:<br />Apple Podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/382Yndj">https://apple.co/382Yndj</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/2sLvVwg">https://spoti.fi/2sLvVwg</a><br />Soundcloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2DJwZ5R">https://bit.ly/2DJwZ5R</a><br /><br />For business inquiries please contact: hautelemode@ellifyagency.com<br /><br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/ujbeats/ifbeat">https://soundcloud.com/ujbeats/ifbeat</a>{% endraw %}
