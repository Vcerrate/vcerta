{% raw %}Description: <br /><br />We had the rare opportunity to speak with Pierre Lassonde, CM, OQ for PrivatePlacements.com, discussing everything from today's runaway inflation, to why he's more bullish on gold and copper than on uranium battery metals, to potential commodity breakouts and beyond.<br /><br />Pierre Lassonde is one of the most famous metals investors in the world. As a member of the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame, the former chairman of the World Gold Council, a recipient of Canada's Order of Merit, and a genuine legend in the mining sector, he's been a major player in the industry for decades. <br /><br />Mr. Lassonde is perhaps best known as the mind behind the tremendously successful Franco-Nevada Corp. (TSX, NYSE: FNV), the world's first gold royalty company, which today has a market cap of over $31 billion. During Lassonde's early tenure at the company, it grew 36 percent compounded for 19 consecutive years.<br /><br />[0:28] - Inflation—how the current situation mirrors what Pierre lived through in the 1970s<br />[3:22] - What's the smart move in today's chaotic market?<br />[6:15] - How to understand the value of a particular mining company<br />[8:04] - How to track a mining company's cycle with Pierre's &quot;Lassonde Curve&quot;<br />[12:10] - One company that Pierre believes may be at the right point of the curve for investment<br />[15:44] - What does Pierre look for when investing in private placements?<br />[19:33] - Pierre explains why he's bullish on copper<br />[25:04] - Don't be a sucker: find out how much the management team paid for their shares<br />[27:42] - How can everyday investors identify the best management teams?<br />[29:40] - What other things does Pierre look for in a potential deal?
