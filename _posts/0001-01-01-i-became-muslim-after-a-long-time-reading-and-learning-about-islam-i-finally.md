{% raw %}After a long time reading and learning about Islam I finally took my Shahada. In the beginning of this journey I never thought that I would become a muslim one day. Before I looked into Islam I had a lot of misunderstandings about the religion. Now I realize that this religion is absolutely different from what I imagined it to be. Everyday I felt more connected with the teaching of Islam because it simply made sense to me that I started to apply the teachings of Islam with baby steps into my daily life. That changed my life for the better and motivates me in so many differents ways. I found relief and comfort within this beautiful religion. Of course I am still by far not where I want to be when it comes to be a good muslim and I will keep learning about Islam. During my life I've been through tough moments (like many of us). Accepting Islam helped me so much. I realize that I have actually always missed to have faith and guidance in my life. It is hard to describe what I exactly feel, I want to say Elhamdoulilah that I found this way, I am so grateful to be a muslim. <br /><br />If you would like to check out my Patreon page,<br />Become a Patreon here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Lisschoice">https://www.patreon.com/Lisschoice</a><br /><br />Paypal:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/Lissieschoice?locale.x=nl_NL">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/Lissieschoice?locale.x=nl_NL</a><br /><br />Follow me on Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lissieschoice">https://www.instagram.com/lissieschoice</a><br /><br />Follow me on Tiktok:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lissieschoice?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@lissieschoice?lang=en</a><br /><br />Thank you for all of you who supported me, it means a lot to me. <br /><br />Please let me know if you have any quetions. <br /><br />See you soon! <br /><br /> â™¡ Liss{% endraw %}
