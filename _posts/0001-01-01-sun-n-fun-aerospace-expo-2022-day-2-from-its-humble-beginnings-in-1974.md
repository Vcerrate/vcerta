{% raw %}From its humble beginnings in 1974 as a fly-in for sport aviation enthusiasts, the SUN ‘n FUN Aerospace Expo has grown into one of the largest and most successful aviation events in the world. This event is Florida’s largest annual convention of any kind, and each year over 200,000 visitors flock to Lakeland for what has become known as Aviation’s Season Opener or Spring Break for Pilots.<br /><br />For those who can't be there LiveAirShowTV will stream three days of weekend airshows from the event.  Plenty of extreme aviation will be on display, including Jeff Boerboon in his YAK-110, the Phillips 66 Aerostars, David Martin, Chef Pitts, Jim Pietz, Class of 45, Patty Wagstaff, Michael Goulian, Greg Koontz, Thom Richard and Rob Holland.  Each day’s show will wrap up with the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds performing their new high-energy demonstration!{% endraw %}
