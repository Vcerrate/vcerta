Now I will go up to the Lord; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”💒<br /><br />📝<br />💧In the decline of the nation's character, by worshiping idols in a heinous way, <br />🏝Moses still invited them to ask forgiveness from God 💧by saying, “You have committed a great sin, but now I will go up to the Lord, maybe I will be able to make atonement because your sin.&quot;<br />​🏝The act of sin can only be forgiven by the process of reconciliation with God.<br />💧*Confession of sins is needed. *<br />🏝It was Moses who made him face the Lord at the hill of Sinai. <br />💧Moses said, &quot;Ah, this people have committed great sins, because they have made a golden god for them.<br />​🏝But now, may you forgive their sins - and if not, erase my name from the book which You wrote &quot; (Exodus 32: 31,32).<br />​💧The request for forgiveness, which was delivered by Moses to God, was a sincere request.<br />🏝In Moses' statement, he said, &quot;this nation has asked for a grave sin, . . may You forgive their sins.&quot; <br />💧Moses' request was granted, but the punishment for sin must still be done.<br />​🏝*The sins of the nation brought consequences for the nation itself. *<br />💧*When we sin, and ask for forgiveness, then God accepts us to be forgiven, *<br />🏝but there must be a result of that sin, that is Jesus' sacrifice.<br />💧Let us honor Jesus’ sacrifice for us in the cross.<br /> 🙏🌺<br /><br />GOD BLESS US🙏🧑🏻👧🏻{% endraw %}
