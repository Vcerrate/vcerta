While signed to Elektra Records in the 1980s and 1990s, Keith Sweat helped define the New Jack Swing sound with a string of irresistible hits like “Twisted”, “Make It Last Forever”, “Make You Sweat”,  “I’ll Give All My Love To You,” “Keep It Comin’” and “Nobody,” a platinum single that features singer Athena Cage. Sweat also discovered the Atlanta-based vocal quintet Silk, for whom he co-wrote and co-produced “Freak Me,” which hit #1 on Billboard’s “Hot 100” in May 1993.<br /><br />A remarkably prolific artist, Sweat has released more than 15 albums over the course of his career – 6 of which were awarded platinum status by the RIAA. Since 2007, Sweat has hosted ‘The Sweat Hotel,’ a nighttime show on iHeart radio that blends a grown &amp; sexy R&amp;B playlist with relationship advice from Sweat himself. <br /><br />And when he’s not on the air, he’s on the road. Sweat continues to perform his music live for fans across the United States week in and week out.
