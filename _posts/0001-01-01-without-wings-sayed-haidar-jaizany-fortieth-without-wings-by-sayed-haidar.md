{% raw %}Without Wings, by Sayed Haidar Jaizany, written by Nouri Sardar.<br /><br />From the EP - Fortieth. Now streaming.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />I am without my wings… in your love I cannot flutter<br />When I speak of my love… I hesitate and I stutter<br />How can a beloved… be out of reach of his lover?<br /><br />How can I gasp for air… when you’ve left me underwater?<br />How can hope reappear… when without you nothing matters <br />My heartbeat is fading... as if death is edging closer <br /><br />Just like your Ruqaya… Master I am without water<br />Your light from me hidden… and in your absence I wither<br />My soul sits in your shrine... and I’ve never felt emptier <br /><br />-<br /><br />Master, you are too far… how I wish that you were nearer<br />My heart it beats your name… it does not beat any other<br />And your shrine calls my name… wanting me as its visitor<br /><br />- <br /><br /><br />It has been far too long... and never have you been further <br />Every year I feel... when Arbaeen edges nearer <br />A sense of such comfort... that you give to your visitors<br /><br />But this year there’s nothing... only despair, only horror <br />Can it really be so... am I not worthy anymore?<br />Heaven is far away... I feel the fumes of hellfire<br /> <br />Peace of mind is fading... my anxiety is stronger <br />My feet are cursing me... and my eyes call me a liar<br />Even they don’t believe... that I will not return this year <br /><br />-<br /><br />In times of grief and pain... whenever we ask, you’d answer <br />But now there is silence... your severed neck we cannot hear <br />The road to you was long... but now it is not even there <br /><br />Without you I’m orphaned... a child without a father <br />Weeping in your absence... much like you, left as a stranger <br />No beloved by me... no comforter and no carer<br /><br />Return me toward you... consider me as Ruqaya<br />Come to me in a dream... just like when you visited her <br />And when I then awake... return my soul to Karbala <br /><br />London - 16/09/20<br /><br />--<br /><br />#Ashura #Karbala<br /><br />www.NouriSardar.com{% endraw %}
