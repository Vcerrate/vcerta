{% raw %}r/Choosingbeggars In today's episode, OP's toxic manager tries to screw OP over by cancelling his very important family vacation. OP laughs at his boss and warns that he's going to take his vacation no matter what. The boss threatens OP to work, or else! This prompts OP to get some revenge on this boss by refusing to do extremely critical work that nobody else in the company can do, resulting in MASSIVE fines. Maybe next time they'll try treating their employees with more respect!<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:06 Honest at least<br />1:02 NFT bro<br />4:26 Pick and choose<br />4:47 Big money and bad bosses<br /><br />ðŸ¤‘ r/Choosingbeggars My Boss Fired Me, Then Begged Me For Money! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZOjQOhJ9zs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZOjQOhJ9zs</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/rslash">https://linktr.ee/rslash</a><br /><br />#reddit #choosingbeggars #funnyredditposts<br />&quot;Sneaky Snitch&quot; Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com), License: CC By Attribution 3.0{% endraw %}
