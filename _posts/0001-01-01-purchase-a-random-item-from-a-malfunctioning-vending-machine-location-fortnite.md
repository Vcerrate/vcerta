{% raw %}Purchase a Random Item From a Malfunctioning Vending Machine Location - Fortnite<br /><br />For one of the Week 6 Season Quests in Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 3 Season 1, you need to &quot;Purchase a Random Item From a Malfunctioning Vending Machine&quot;.<br /><br />The best way to find a Malfunctioning Vending Machine is to first land in Coney Crossroads, grab a car, and check the 3 Vending Machines in this POI for one that is Red. A Red Vending Machine means its Malfunctioning. If there's not one in Coney Crossroads, head to Sleepy Sound where there's another 3 Vending Machines that you can check. <br /><br />Keep repeating this route in different games until you find one that is Red and Malfunctioning. When you do find one, simply buy an item from it to complete this quest.<br /><br />===============<br /><br /><br /><br />Subscribe Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/N4tdAa">https://goo.gl/N4tdAa</a><br /><br /><br /><br />How I Record my Gameplay: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/48YTtm">https://goo.gl/48YTtm</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Contact Me:<br /><br /><br /><br />▶ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/harryninetyfour">http://www.twitter.com/harryninetyfour</a><br /><br />▶ PSN: HarryNinetyFour_<br /><br />▶ Xbox Live: HarryNinetyFour{% endraw %}
