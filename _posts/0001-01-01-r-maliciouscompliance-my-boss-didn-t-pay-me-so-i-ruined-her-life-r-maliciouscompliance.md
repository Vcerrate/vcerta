{% raw %}r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, OP works for as a campaign manager for a local candidate. She is incredibly good at her job, so much so that the candidate's entire campaign depends on OP. The candidate does what all Karens do -- she pisses off the wrong person by firing OP and refusing to pay OP her last month's salary. OP gets her revenge by systematically destroying her campaign and exploiting Karen's own stupidity to get a copy of the contract forcing Karen to pay up. <br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:08 Food swap<br />2:00 Campaign manager<br />12:32 Landlord holding my deposit<br />14:26 Mail sorting<br /><br />ðŸ‘Œ r/Maliciouscompliance Mom: &quot;DON'T DISCIPLINE MY CHILD!&quot; Babysitter: &quot;lol ok&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngS42I-iPnA&amp;list=PLQWFBACAObMi3zxX8waBldaJraDNye7tN">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngS42I-iPnA&amp;list=PLQWFBACAObMi3zxX8waBldaJraDNye7tN</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/rslash">https://linktr.ee/rslash</a><br /><br />#reddit #maliciouscompliance #funnyredditposts<br />&quot;Sneaky Snitch&quot; Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) License: CC By Attribution 3.0{% endraw %}
