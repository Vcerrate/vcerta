Yes, it can be extremely rewarding, but it can also be dirty, frustrating, dangerous, and tiring.<br /><br />Don’t go into nursing for the pay. Although, on the surface, pay rates can look very enticing, you have to work extremely hard, and extremely long hours to earn the good rates. Shiftwork is often involved, and this is just really bad for your health.<br /><br />What it takes to be a nurse is to work many, many hours of unpaid overtime, as nurses are never paid for their overtime, and most nurses work longer than their allocated shift nearly every shift they work. By the time I decided I’d had enough, I was working at least 2 hours unpaid overtime every shift I worked - and that’s not uncommon! There's always something unexpected happening which takes a long time to deal with.<br /><br />It’s easy to say “let the next shift finish the work”, but they have their own work to do, and they haven’t got time to finish other people’s work.<br /><br />So by the time I’d been nursing for over 40 years, I decided I didn’t have what it takes to be a nurse any longer, and I left nursing to start my own online business. Well, what a ride that’s been!<br /><br />It’s been a steep learning curve but, with the help of some amazing mentors, I’m now at the stage where I’m starting to see results, and I know they are going to build from now on. I will very soon have residual income coming in. So the hard work’s been worth it, and I’m incredibly grateful to the people who’ve assisted me get to the stage I’m at.<br /><br />If you think this may be something you’re interested in, and sounds better than all the hard work involved in nursing, click on the link at the top of this description. They’ll help you succeed too. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vWnxanpqyU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vWnxanpqyU</a>{% endraw %}
