{% raw %}Jessica Stocker, the Metaverse queen, explains to Jay exactly what the Metaverse is and how it works for users and retailers. Jay also gets an education on Metaverse terminology, how land ownership works, and who started this entire digital land. Plus you can hear Jay's brain melt as Jessica tries to explain how land ownership works and where the money goes when people buy into the Metaverse. We also get Jessica's reasoning for selling her land parcels in Decentraland, how the space is still developing and growing, and where businesses are succeeding and failing. Jessica also gives Jay some of the big positives from the Metaverse, like interacting with sick relatives that people cannot visit, or providing education to people that may not have access to schools in their region.{% endraw %}
