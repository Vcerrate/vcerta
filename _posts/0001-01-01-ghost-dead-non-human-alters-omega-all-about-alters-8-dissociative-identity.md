{% raw %}THIS VIDEO IS A RE-UPLOAD OF AN ORIGINAL VIDEO FIRST POSTED TO YOUTUBE.COM/DISSOCIADID ON: 1st March 2020<br /><br />THIS VIDEO WAS CREATED SOLELY BY US WITH NO OUTSIDE INPUT. WE ARE THE SOLE CREATORS AND THE SOLE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OF THIS VIDEO AND ITS CONTENT. THIS FACT IS NOT DISPUTED.<br /><br />&quot;Thank you to our Patrons for voting on this topic!<br />We know the sound is a little different in this video, omega speaks EXTREMELY quietly and the sound needed a lot of post-production editing to make it audible. We made it as clean as we could with the software we have and hope it doesn't distract from the important information Omega gives in this video.
