{% raw %}Dreams, that's where I have to go<br />To see your beautiful - face anymore<br />I stare at a picture of you, and listen to the radio<br />Hope, hope there's a conversation<br />We both admit we had it good<br />But until then it's alienation, I know<br />That much is understood<br />And I realize<br /><br />[Chorus:]<br />If you ask me how I'm doing<br />I would say I'm doing just fine<br />I would lie and say that you're not on my mind<br />But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two<br />And finally I'm forced to face the truth,<br />No matter what I say I'm - not over you (not over you)<br /><br />Damn, damn girl you do it well<br />And I thought you were innocent<br />Took this heart and put it through hell<br />But still you're magnificent<br />I I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me<br />I turn around and I'm back in the game<br />Even better than the old me<br />But I'm not even close without you<br /><br />[Chorus:]<br />If you ask me how I'm doing<br />I would say I'm doing just fine<br />I would lie and say that you're not on my mind<br />But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two<br />And finally I'm forced to face the truth,<br />No matter what I say I'm - not over you (not over you)<br /><br />And if I had the chance to renew<br />You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do<br />I could get back on the right track<br />But only if you'd be convinced<br />So until then...<br /><br />[Chorus:]<br />If you ask me how I'm doing<br />I would say I'm doing just fine<br />I would lie and say that you're not on my mind<br />But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two<br />And finally I'm forced to face the truth,<br />No matter what I say I'm -<br />Not over you<br />Not over you<br />Not over you<br />Not over you{% endraw %}
