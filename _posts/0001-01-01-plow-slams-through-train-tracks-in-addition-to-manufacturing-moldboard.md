Pathfinders, so equipped, will withstand the most rigorous commercial and municipal usage, encountering with ease the most destructive fixed obstructions known to snowplows-sewer covers, shutoffs, railway tracks, curbs, frozen snow, rocks, etc., responsible for bending and breaking other moldboard trip and trip edge designs of snowplows.<br /><br />For more information on the Model TE, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pathfindersnowplows.com/model-te">http://www.pathfindersnowplows.com/model-te</a> <br /><br />Keep up with our latest content:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/pathfindersnowplows">http://www.facebook.com/pathfindersnowplows</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/pathfindersnowplows">http://www.instagram.com/pathfindersnowplows</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/pathfindersnow">http://www.twitter.com/pathfindersnow</a>{% endraw %}
