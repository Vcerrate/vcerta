{% raw %}Recreate an evening out at a cozy French cafe with this menu prepared by Jacques Pepin. He starts off the meal with a fennel and pear salad with sun dried tomatoes. Instead of croutons, he bakes won ton chips to give the dish an extra savory crunch. Next he moves on to the main course: a succulent fillet of pork served with handmade gnocchi. And for dessert, forget the frapuccino, Jacques makes a frozen coffee dessert you can enjoy at home.<br /><br />In This Episode:<br />00:00<br />1:00 Fennel and pear salad with sun dried tomatoes<br />4:35 How to make won ton wrapper chips <br />7:12 Fillet of pork charcuterie with gnocchi recipe.
