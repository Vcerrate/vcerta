I have recently completed a similar video, H&amp;D 1 Deluxe in 86 minutes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6Bd4ZWgVuQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6Bd4ZWgVuQ</a> (available in stereoscopic 3D as well as regular 2D).<br /><br /><br />Locations: Norway, North Africa, Burma, Austria, France, Czechoslovakia<br /><br />The goal was to complete the whole game, using segments, in as little time as possible.<br /><br />If you see me walk past enemies, or they seem too slow to react, that's because I wear an enemy disguise in many missions. I used version 1.1.0 of the game which lets you heal yourself quickly. I used the large medpack in most missions, which can be applied about 12 times. It also recharges between missions.<br /><br />No cheats were used, which was checked by multiple SDA verifiers. Troll messages regarding this won't be responded to, and may be removed.<br /><br />More information available in the following forum topic:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/hd2speedrun">http://tinyurl.com/hd2speedrun</a><br /><br /><br />Note on the first mission:<br /><br />After skipping the Training Camp, the first mission offers two routes into the enemy compound. In both cases, I have to follow a guide as I approach it, so there's a short scripted sequence that cannot be skipped. (If you run ahead of the guide, he waits for you to come back. If you don't, a crucial mission goal is not fulfilled and you can't finish the mission.) Shooting starts at around 4 minutes into the video.<br /><br />I used the &quot;back door&quot; route with the wire cutter. This route takes roughly the same time as the frontal attack, but I don't have to kill as many enemies. What's more, I end up at the favorable end of the camp: I just have to go through the enemy base and do what has to be done in this &quot;kill them all&quot; mission. The other route would require going through the camp twice.<br /><br />I let the dog wound me a couple of times (and not just in this mission) because the more I heal myself, the better medic I become -- this skill is indispensable in later, more heated missions.<br /><br /><br />Note on the first African mission, Spaghetti Airport:<br /><br />This map is flawed in that sometimes the flight book, which is a mission objective, is nowhere to be found (at least in version 1.1.0 of the game). I go to the far end of the airport for the book first (roughly a 1 in 10 chance that it's there) and get a disguise (which is also risky; the enemy usually kills you or dies far too easily) -- all in one segment.<br /><br />Shooting at the incoming reinforcements with the MG42 got its dedicated segment since killing all those distant soldiers without having to reload takes quite a bit of luck. There are only 75 bullets.<br /><br /><br />Note on the night mission in North Africa (Caravan):<br /><br />This mission is especially fun for a number of reasons. First, there's a 2-minute waiting time before the enemy arrives. With the amount of weapons and ammo lying around, one can prepare for the battle very well. Second, even as Lone Wolf, you get a companion, in the form of German doctor Michael Axmann (who borrowed his name from one of the game designers! :). He takes orders and is apparently indestructible -- I suppose the enemy doesn't shoot back at him since he's German. If he weren't in this mission, I myself would have to go to the distant corner of the map to kill the necessary number of soldiers.<br /><br /><br />Note on the Burmese missions, Operations Stranger and Anthill:<br /><br />Not many HD2 players know that there is a surrender monkey among the Japanese soldiers. Great opportunity to get a disguise which will be extremely useful in the next mission. It took the shortest segment in the whole run to get that disguise.<br /><br />In the second mission, you don't actually have to kill everyone in the two bunkers like the mission objectives say. It's enough to finish the important-looking commanders in the top brass gear in each bunker.<br /><br /><br />Please read the comments and the description before you ask a question. Thanks.<br /><br /><br /><br />List of other speedruns I've completed:<br /><br />Hidden &amp; Dangerous 1 Deluxe completed in 86 minutes<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXCtiULbxlU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXCtiULbxlU</a><br />Far Cry 3 speedrun completed in 3:44<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB5MOq9Sm0I">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB5MOq9Sm0I</a><br />Star Wars KotOR completed in 2 hours - Knights of the Old Republic I<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r9cCfGV0Uc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r9cCfGV0Uc</a><br />KotOR II completed in 2 hours - Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II Done Quick<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vveJ1y9X_UY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vveJ1y9X_UY</a><br />X-Wing Alliance Death Star II Tunnel Speedrun<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFzm0u5Oa9U">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFzm0u5Oa9U</a><br />X-Wing Alliance - Training Course speedrun (Ringer1) <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABuwASsYwM4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABuwASsYwM4</a>{% endraw %}
