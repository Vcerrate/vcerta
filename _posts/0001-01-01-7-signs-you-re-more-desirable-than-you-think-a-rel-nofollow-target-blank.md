In this video men's style, grooming, fitness, and lifestyle expert, Aaron Marino of IAmAlphaM  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://iamalpham.com/ AaronMarino https://aaronmarino.com/ Pete">https://iamalpham.com/ AaronMarino https://aaronmarino.com/ Pete</a> &amp; Pedro <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://peteandpedro.com/ Tiege">https://peteandpedro.com/ Tiege</a> Hanley <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiege.com/and ENEMY https://enemy.com/ says">https://www.tiege.com/and ENEMY https://enemy.com/ says</a> even if you don't have these characteristics, you are more desirable than you think. <br /><br />YOU ARE APPEALING TO WOMEN WHEN YOU ARE...<br /><br />1. Acting like a man -- not a man, puss, or beta. You don't have a victim mentality; you make changes and understand when someone disagrees with you.<br /><br />2. Possessing emotional intelligence -- you are aware of your emotions and other's emotions. You are empathetic and can connect with others on a deeper level.<br /><br />3. Having an amazing package -- your package is how you project yourself when you walk into the room. This non-verbal communication includes body language, eye contact, handshake, clothing &amp; its condition, and grooming. You will be desired or shunned depending on how you present yourself.<br /><br />4. Being financially responsible -- you understand money, have a budget, and live below your means. If you are good with money, you are incredibly desirable.<br /><br />5. Having a sense of humor -- you don't take yourself too seriously. If you have a great personality and can laugh at yourself, people will want to be around you. You can develop your sense of humor. Sending memes is an easy way to have humor associated with you.<br /><br />6. Having intelligence -- you seek knowledge and education that will make you more interesting and have better conversations.<br /><br />7. Being adventurous and friendly. -- if you are willing to try new experiences, you are not boring and basic.Also, you talk to &amp; engage people, smile, and say 'hello' and 'how is your day going?' You don't bury your face in your phone, and you talk to strangers in line.{% endraw %}
