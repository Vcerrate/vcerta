{% raw %}Overlanding is a combination of remote travel, off-roading, and camping. Overlanding's origins date back to the early 1900s, when Australia began to establish routes for long-distance travel within the continent.<br /><br />Overlanding is booming in popularity, largely because people yearn for knowledge and adventure. Perhaps more folks are wanting to get away from the city madness! Whatever the reason, overlanding gives you an opportunity to explore the world and learn from it.<br /><br />Overlanding and camping are sometimes used synonymously with one another, as people tend to think they are referring to the same thing. While there are many similarities between the two, camping focuses on your campsite's destination, while Overlanding focuses on the overall journey<br /><br />#Dawgvlogs #OverlandKings #FordRaptor{% endraw %}
