{% raw %}Name a type of stone tool that shaped the development of humans. Thinking of handaxes? Its definitely a well-known tool type, but can you name any others?<br /><br />Arguably one of the most influential methods for making stone tools in the evolution humans is blade core technology. Detaching many flakes of stone with razor-sharp, parallel edges is clearly a beneficial process, but when did it first appear? Was it modern humans? Or an earlier hominid?<br /><br />What does this method of stone tool making tell us about prehistoric tool makers? Experimental archaeologist Dr James Dilley discusses some of the background knowledge as well as showing how to go about making blades from a core.<br /><br />Filmed &amp; Produced by: Emma Jones<br />---------<br />References:<br />Oldest stone tools image credit: “MPK-WTAP”<br />Tabun cave credit: Greg Schechter<br />---------<br />To find out more about my flintknapping and experimental archaeology visit my website or follow me on social media!<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ancientcraft.co.uk/">http://www.ancientcraft.co.uk/</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ancientcraftUK">https://twitter.com/ancientcraftUK</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AncientCraftUK/">https://www.facebook.com/AncientCraftUK/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ancientcraftuk/">https://www.instagram.com/ancientcraftuk/</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/AncientCraftUK">https://www.patreon.com/AncientCraftUK</a>{% endraw %}
