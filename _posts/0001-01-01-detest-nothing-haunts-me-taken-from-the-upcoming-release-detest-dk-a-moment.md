{% raw %}Taken from the upcoming release DETEST (Dk) A Moment Of Love Official MCD coming from Dark Symphonies<br /><br />Copenhagen based DETEST has created and delivered obscure trends since the beginning of the 1990s to people who love death metal. The band's legendary 94 release 'Dorval' expanded the framework for death metal, and has since demonstrated how to perform and craft malicious wickedness.<br /><br />DETEST is once again ready for the equilibrium of obscene wickedness of several dimensions, which from beginning to end encompasses live shows and a brand new release &quot;A Moment Of Love&quot;. 6 new songs of crushing, old school death metal played the DETEST way!!{% endraw %}
