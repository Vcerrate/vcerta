{% raw %}This is a lecture about chapter 11 of Russ Shafer-Landau's book 'Whatever Happened to Good and Evil?' It deals with Moral Skepticism, Moral Nihilism, Moral Subjectivism, Moral Relativism, as well as the global versions of all of these views, which are self-defeating. All of the uses of &quot;Moral&quot; are understood as equivalent to &quot;Ethical&quot;. This lecture is part of an introductory-level philosophy course, Introduction to Ethics.{% endraw %}
