{% raw %}www.patreon.com/IanHubert<br />Finally finished this up! Sorry to anyone who thought it was going to be longer; that'd be a blast some day, but this got it out of my system for now :) <br /><br />Solid mix of hand animated stuff, physics sims, and data from a Rokoko mocap suit (learned a ton about IK rigging, too, to mix it all up)!<br /><br />Music by Wilbert Roget II<br />Thanks to the Photoscanned Models, <br />Sean Farbolin, Kaitlin Romig, Johnny Valencia, Nate Taylor, Ian Hubert<br /><br />Made in blender, with some After Effects postwork{% endraw %}
