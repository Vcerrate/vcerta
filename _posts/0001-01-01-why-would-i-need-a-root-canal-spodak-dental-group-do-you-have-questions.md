{% raw %}Do you have questions about why you might need a root canal, and what a root canal is? Dr. Alfredo Arauz is here to help and explains the ins and outs of root canals. <br /><br />Most patients who come to our office and complain of pain, discomfort or swelling, but don’t know why. One common reason is that they had a large cavity in the tooth that went down to the nerve, causing a dental abscess. For this scenario, root canals are the best option for treating the infection and getting the patient out of pain. <br /><br />The purpose of the root canal is to relieve the pain and release the infection by draining it through a canal that is created from the bottom of the tooth to the top. Once that’s accomplished, the dental practitioner puts in a series of dental files, almost like very tiny stainless steel bottle cleaners, that clean out the nerve and any debris from the infection. After the infection has been drained, the practitioner then puts in medications and then fills the canals so they’re properly sealed and protected. X-rays are taken throughout this entire process to make sure the treatment was performed as adequately and as precisely as possible. <br /><br />After the root canal is completed, the tooth then needs to be restored. Your doctor will add a buildup (a big filling), or in the case of a large tooth or a molar, a crown would be recommended to cover and protect the tooth.<br /><br />After a root canal, avoid eating hard foods for a period of time, making sure that the tooth is covered and protected by a crown. Without a crown, there is a chance that, over time, the tooth can fracture or crack, so it’s important to protect the tooth and avoid any future symptoms. <br /><br />Root canals are an amazing procedure to save your teeth with a goal to give you a long lasting smile! <br /><br />Spodak Dental Group, a 2017 Inc. 5000 honoree, is a comprehensive dental destination providing all general and specialty services in one convenient, state-of-the-art, LEED Gold Certiﬁed facility.
