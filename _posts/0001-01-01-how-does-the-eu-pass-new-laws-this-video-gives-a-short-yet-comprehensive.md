{% raw %}This video gives a short yet comprehensive explanation of the regular yet complicated way new EU law is made (the Ordinary Legislative Procedure). It sheds a simplified light on the process as a whole, the main actors and some of the possible complications.<br /><br />For more information on the EU and its institutions please subscribe to our channel.<br /><br />In this series we explain complex aspects of the EU in a comprehensive and understandable way. If however, despite our diligence and help of Dr. Jan Oster, we have left something out or made a mistake, please be so kind to tell and forgive us.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />With Ciceroni we seek to be a guide to European culture and history. We make videos on little known subjects as well as more ubiquitous ones, ranging from current affairs like the European Union, to historic events like the Tulip Mania, and even mythological stories like those of the Greek Gods. In all these videos we strive to present the subjects in a objective manner and within their complex context.<br /><br />Become a Patron: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Ciceroni">https://www.patreon.com/Ciceroni</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Ciceroni_EU">https://twitter.com/Ciceroni_EU</a> <br />Like us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CiceroniChan...">https://www.facebook.com/CiceroniChan...</a>{% endraw %}
