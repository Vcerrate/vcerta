The Pink Floyd DVD concert was initially released on VHS, Video CD, and Laserdisc formats. The Pink Floyd film was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video at the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards. <br /><br />The Momentary Lapse of Reason tour (documented on the release) marked a rebirth for Pink Floyd. David Gilmour and Nick Mason had won the rights to the band’s name after a legal battle with bassist Roger Waters, who had left the group a few years earlier. The guitarist and drummer brought back keyboardist Rick Wright, who had been fired around the making of The Wall, and made A Momentary Lapse, which made it up to Number Three in the U.S. and solidified their place as an act that could play arenas and stadiums. The progressive rock band ended up playing to more than 4.25 million fans around the world over the course of more than two years.<br /><br />Pink Floyd is David Gilmour - guitars, console steel guitar, vocals; Nick Mason - drums and Richard Wright – keyboards, piano, Hammond organ, vocals with Tim Renwick – guitars, vocals; Jon Carin – keyboards, piano, programming, vocals; Scott Page – saxophones, oboe, guitar; Guy Pratt – bass, vocals; Gary Wallis – percussion; and Margret Taylor, Rachel Fury, Durga McBroom – backing vocals.
