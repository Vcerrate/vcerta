{% raw %}Randy takes us on a walk around of the most recent restoration to be completed at The Lab, an exceedingly rare 4 seater Meyers Manx Resorter dune buggy, one of less that 35 documented to exist out of 75 built for special use at tropical resorts in the 1970's. Full and complete restoration from top to bottom, this signed and certified bit of Meyers Manx history is one sweet little ride.{% endraw %}
