{% raw %}Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Spiderman: No Way Home, and LOKI all discuss the Multiverse, but does the Multiverse actually exist? <br /><br />According to Marvel’s Doctor Strange, “the multiverse is a concept about which we know frighteningly little.”, But, it's not just a brain-breaking concept in Marvel movies...it's a brain-breaking concept in real life too! Let's explore Marvel's latest scientific obsession.<br /><br />Meet the Life Noggin Team!<br />▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀<br />Director/Voice - Pat Graziosi: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/PatGraziosi">http://twitter.com/PatGraziosi</a> <br />Executive Producer - Keith Comito: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/KeithComito">https://twitter.com/KeithComito</a><br />Animation by Robert Grisham<br />Edits by Tim Maupin<br />Written by Ashleen Knutsen<br /><br />Sources:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/HxZv2WxB">https://pastebin.com/HxZv2WxB</a><br /><br />Our Spoiler-Free Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness Review:<br />Loved the other superhero cameos and how Sam Raimi didn't hold back on setting up how ruthlessly powerful certain Marvel characters are.  <br />His cinematic touches we're all over this movie for better or worse. One particular transition was very Raimi-esque and a tad jarring. Just a small amount of VFX shots were a little wonky during the beginning fight scene where Strange is trying to rescue America Chavez, but certain fight scenes in this movie make up for it with their stunning visuals. Elizabeth Olsen did a fantastic job in this movie and stole every scene she was in. The films pacing could've been better so the audience could care about certain characters and the actual Multiverses themselves, but I'm sure we'll get more character development as the MCU Phase 4 unravels. Spiderman: No Way Home handled the Multiverse in a more fan servicey way, but we didn't travel out of the 616 Marvel universe. This Doctor Strange movie could have really explored the different Multiverses a bit more.<br /><br />#DoctorStrange #Multiverse #Marvel{% endraw %}
