On this video is legendery Mike Mentzer one of the first science based bodybuilder and bodybuilder of a golden era.<br /><br />Mentzer was an Objectivist and insisted that philosophy and bodybuilding are one and the same. He said &quot;Man is an indivisible entity, an integrated unit of mind and body.&quot; Thus, his books contain as much philosophy as they do bodybuilding information.<br /><br />Mentzer took the bodybuilding concepts developed by Arthur Jones and attempted to perfect them. Through years of study, observation, knowledge of stress physiology, the most up-to-date scientific information available, and careful use of his reasoning abilities, Mentzer devised and successfully implemented his own theory of bodybuilding. Mentzer's theories are intended to help a drug-free person achieve his or her full genetic potential within the shortest amount of time.<br /><br />High-Intensity Training the Mike Mentzer Way was Mentzer's final work. In it, he detailed the principles of high intensity weight training. Weight training, he insisted, had to be brief, infrequent, and intense, to attain the best results in the shortest amount of time. Heavy Duty II also espouses critical thinking. In this book, Mentzer shows why people need to use their reasoning ability to live happy, mature, adult lives, and he shows readers how to go about doing so. Bodybuilding was endorsed as only one potential component of an individual's existence, encouraging many other worthwhile pursuits throughout his books.<br /><br />Credits for idea goes to @Kopera{% endraw %}
