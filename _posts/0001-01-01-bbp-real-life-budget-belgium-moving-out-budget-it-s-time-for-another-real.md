{% raw %}It's time for another Real Life Budget. We asked my readers to submit their REAL information. Real spending, real debt, and real savings goals.<br /><br />I am taking those real-life numbers and showing you how I would organize and budget that information using my Budget By Paycheck¬Æ Method.<br /><br />In this video, I will be showing the real numbers from a reader, Ghofrane. She is a digital marketer and currently lives at home with her mom in Belgium. She is wanting to save enough money and be financially prepared to move out for the first time. For this Real Life Budget, I am breaking down the steps I would take to prepare for that expense! This is also the first Real Life Budget we have shown in Euros.<br /><br />CHAPTERS:<br />00:00 Introduction<br />01:46 WHY &amp; Story<br />03:53 Income &amp; Pay Schedule<br />04:19 Fixed Expenses<br />04:46 Variable Expenses<br />05:35 Debt Picture<br />05:46 Savings Goals<br />06:31 BBP Method<br />09:04 How to prepare yourself for moving out (mock budget)<br />13:43 Conclusion<br /><br />‚û°Ô∏è TRACKING YOUR SPENDING USING THE HIGHLIGHTER METHOD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3hZ752b">https://bit.ly/3hZ752b</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è GET THE BUDGET BY PAYCHECK WORKBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3J7qytp">https://bit.ly/3J7qytp</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è HOW I TRACK MY SPENDING: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3aIe89I">https://bit.ly/3aIe89I</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è HOW TO USE A BUDGET CALENDAR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2IzF2Vj">https://bit.ly/2IzF2Vj</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è FINDING YOUR WHY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3aJUryj">https://bit.ly/3aJUryj</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è THE BUDGET MOM'S FINANCIAL FREEDOM STEPS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3cfJXsp">https://bit.ly/3cfJXsp</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è HOW TO GET STARTED WITH THE CASH ENVELOPE METHOD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2vQJaO5">https://bit.ly/2vQJaO5</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è HOW TO CREATE A PLAN OF ATTACK TO PAY OFF DEBT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2wDETxF">https://bit.ly/2wDETxF</a><br /><br />ABOUT ME<br /><br />I'm the blogger behind <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebudgetmom.com.">https://www.thebudgetmom.com.</a> I have a rambunctious 6-year-old son, live in Washington, and I'm passionate about helping people with money management and personal finance.
