{% raw %}There is a very modern trend, based on cultural relativism, to pretend that all nations and cultures are as good as each other and that no one is any better than the others.  This is a mistaken view. Britain and its culture stand head and shoulders above all others and should serve as the yardstick by which we measure other people and their ways.{% endraw %}
