{% raw %}Thanks Steve! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SteveMould">https://www.youtube.com/c/SteveMould</a><br /><br />I recommend these apps for Android:<br />Mastermind (but called Bulls and Cows) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xbasoft.master_mind&amp;fbclid=IwAR2Q1H3v1CrcHIfE_X2wHPLzuH0htO77aYD1-Ia18lnwI2YA4_lmbrY2jA4">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xbasoft.master_mind&amp;fbclid=IwAR2Q1H3v1CrcHIfE_X2wHPLzuH0htO77aYD1-Ia18lnwI2YA4_lmbrY2jA4</a><br />Bulls and Cows <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vist.bullscows&amp;fbclid=IwAR1jRgdwNfann3Nks_reT97KEx9qJiCPwwhfpdgbJhsE5cIaImrQiQ9uhLY">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vist.bullscows&amp;fbclid=IwAR1jRgdwNfann3Nks_reT97KEx9qJiCPwwhfpdgbJhsE5cIaImrQiQ9uhLY</a><br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Let's go through some Mastermind algorithms. Here are two human methods:<br /><br />Randomly Consistent: Picking any remaining valid combination at random. (Swaszek 1999).<br />FIRST GUESS = ANY, MAX = 10, AVG = 4.638.<br />Here is an example of 10 consistent guesses: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cut-the-knot.org/ctk/Rafler.shtml">https://www.cut-the-knot.org/ctk/Rafler.shtml</a><br />Randomly Consistent can be improved with FIRST GUESS = 1123, then MAX = 9 and AVG = 4.58.<br /><br />Simple: This algorithm just goes through the combinations in numerical order from 1111 to 6666, and picking the next consistent combination. (Shapiro 1983).<br />FIRST GUESS: 1111, MAX = 9, AVG = 5.765<br />This method can be improved with a FIRST GUESS = 5466, then MAX = 7, AVG = 4.646.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Here is the Least Worst Case Scenario method:<br /><br />Least Worst Case Scenario (simple): Consider the table of responses at each step, and choose a combination (from the remaining combinations) with the least worse case scenario. (Norvig 1984).<br />FIRST GUESS = 1122, MAX = 6, AVG = 4.478<br /><br />Least Worst Case Scenario (full): Consider the table of responses at each step, and choose the combination (from all combinations) with the least worse case scenario. (Donald Knuth 1977).<br />FIRST GUESS = 1122, MAX = 5, AVG = 4.476.<br /><br />***CORRECTION: I said 4.478 not 4.476 in the video. I mixed up the two Worst Case Scenario methods***<br /><br />In Knuth's paper, he gives an example of a game that needs an inconsistent move to guarantee a solve in 5 steps.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/teaching/cs3530/resources/knuth-mastermind.pdf">https://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/teaching/cs3530/resources/knuth-mastermind.pdf</a><br /><br />Using Least Worst Algorithm the most difficult codes are 1221, 2354,  3311, 4524, 5656, 6643. <br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Here are some other methods:<br /><br />Expected Case: Consider the table of responses, and choose the combination with the smallest average scenario. (Irving 1979).<br />FIRST GUESS 1123, MAX = 6, AVG = 4.395.<br /><br />Entropy: Using the table of responses, maximise entropy. (Neuwirth, 1982).<br />FIRST GUESS 1234, MAX = 6, AVG = 4.415.<br />Entropy is an idea from Information Theory and is quite technical. 3b1b goes into it in detail in his wordle video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/v68zYyaEmEA">https://youtu.be/v68zYyaEmEA</a><br /><br />Most Parts: Using the table of responses, pick the choice with the most non-zero parts. (Kooi 2005).<br />FIRST GUESS = 1123, MAX = 6, AVG = 4.374.<br />The idea here is to divide the remaining possibilities into as many buckets as possible. This increases the probability of a lucky guess.<br />Interestingly, this method performs well in the 4-digit, 6 colour mastermind, but not as well with other numbers of digits and colours.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />And here is the Optimal method:<br /><br />Optimal: Deep search to create a look-up table that gives the lowest average. (Koyoma and Lai 1993).<br />FIRST GUESS = 1123, MAX = 6, AVG = 4.340.<br />Interesting fact, there is only one combination that takes 6 steps, (namely 4421).<br /><br />Adjusted Optimal: Deep search to find the lowest average, with a max of 5. (Koyoma and Lai 1993).<br />FIRST GUESS = 1123, MAX = 5, AVG = 4.341.<br />This is something that got edited out of the video for time. With a few adjustments, the optimal max is reduced to 5, with a tiny increase to the average.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Here is another humanly possible method, which I think is fun, but is very different:<br /><br />Static Mastermind: A set of 6 fixed combinations, that can completely determine any secret combination on the seventh step.<br />GUESSES = 1212, 2263, 3344, 4554, 5316, 6156.<br />Here is the article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cut-the-knot.org/ctk/Mastermind.shtml">https://www.cut-the-knot.org/ctk/Mastermind.shtml</a><br />(My list is different to the article, because I tried to make it more memorable).<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Bulls and Cows: The original game. Using pen and paper, a 4-digit number is chosen without repeats.<br /><br />Random: FIRST GUESS = ANY, MAX = 8, AVG = 5.445<br />Least Worst Case: FIRST GUESS = 1234, MAX = 7, AVG = 5.380<br />Optimal: FIRST GUESS = 1234, MAX = 7, AVG = 5.213<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Generalisations: What about mastermind using n positions, and k colours? <br /><br />We have partial information about maximums and averages.
