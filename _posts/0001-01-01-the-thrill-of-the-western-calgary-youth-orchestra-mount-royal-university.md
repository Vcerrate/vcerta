This is a fitting musical companion to the &quot;Wild West&quot; spirit which comes to life in Calgary each July, with the arrival of the Calgary Stampede, one of the oldest rodeos in North America.<br />After reviewing over one hundred and fifty Westerns (movies and TV series), Mr. Agopian chose twenty-two scores for this project. Donovan Seidle, CYO alumnus, and presently Assistant Concertmaster of the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, was commissioned to arrange this music for the CYO.&quot;{% endraw %}
