{% raw %}A 1.5-litre V16 engine sounds like something from a work of fiction. But in the 1950s it was very real and fitted to a series of four F1 racing cars. Successful it was not, but sonorous and gloriously overcomplicated it definitely was.<br /><br />In 2021 the Owen family, behind British Racing Motors for so many years, brought the V16 back with a continuation car, the fifth of four, launched at the Goodwood Revival along with all the other V16s ever made. It makes for an amazing sight, an extraordinary sound and a heartwarming tale of a family dream that brought a legend back to life.<br /><br /><br />#GoodwoodRevival #F1 #BRMV16 <br /><br />Official Website ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.goodwood.com/grr/">http://www.goodwood.com/grr/</a><br />Facebook ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/goodwoodrrc">http://www.facebook.com/goodwoodrrc</a><br />Instagram ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/goodwoodrrc/">http://www.instagram.com/goodwoodrrc/</a> <br />Twitter ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/goodwoodrrc">http://www.twitter.com/goodwoodrrc</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE for more racing cars, supercars, new car reviews, historic motorsport and Goodwood event coverage  ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/GoodwoodTV">http://bit.ly/GoodwoodTV</a><br /><br />Buy your Goodwood Event tickets ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/GWBuyTickets">http://bit.ly/GWBuyTickets</a>{% endraw %}
