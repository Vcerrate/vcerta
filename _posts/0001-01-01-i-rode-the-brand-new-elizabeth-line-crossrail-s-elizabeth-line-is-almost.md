{% raw %}Crossrail's Elizabeth line is almost here ... and TfL had a press day where invited several people along to see the stations and ride the train between Paddington to Liverpool Street - and it was epic! You're going love this new line and all the new stations!<br /><br />Construction officially started in 2009, but digging with the first TBM started in 2011.<br /><br />Camera: James Taylor - Hire him for all your production needs!<br /><br />Also, there's a #PurpleTrain Merch Store, you can find that here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.purpletrain.store/">https://www.purpletrain.store/</a>{% endraw %}
