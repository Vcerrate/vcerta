{% raw %}I’m a mum, a lifelong climate advocate, and I’ve worked in the NFP sector for twenty years to make our community stronger. <br /><br />It’s been a privilege, but it’s not enough. It takes good policy to take good care of people.<br /><br />That’s why I’m running with the Greens.<br /><br />Together, we are powerful. Join me, to secure a better future for everyone.{% endraw %}
