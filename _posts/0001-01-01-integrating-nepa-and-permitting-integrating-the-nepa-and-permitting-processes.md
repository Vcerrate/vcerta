{% raw %}Integrating the NEPA and permitting processes seeks to transform how agencies and stakeholders conduct concurrent, synchronized environmental and permitting reviews, saving time and cost for the agencies involved.<br /><br />This breakout session on Integrating NEPA and Permitting was recorded at the Federal Highway Administrationâ€™s Every Day Counts (EDC) Regional Summits in the fall of 2016.  The Summits provided transportation professionals the opportunity to learn about the 11 innovations promoted through EDC-4, exchange ideas with their agency and industry counterparts in neighboring States, and provide feedback to FHWA on the support and resources needed to adopt the innovations in their own States.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovation/everydaycounts/edc_4/nepa.cfm">https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovation/everydaycounts/edc_4/nepa.cfm</a> <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovation/everydaycounts/edc_4/">https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovation/everydaycounts/edc_4/</a>{% endraw %}
