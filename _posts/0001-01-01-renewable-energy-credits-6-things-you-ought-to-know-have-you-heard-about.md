{% raw %}Have you heard about renewable energy credits (RECs)?<br /><br />They’re market-based instruments that certify the bearer owns one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated from a renewable energy source.<br /><br />If a power provider feeds the energy into the grid, the REC received can be sold on the open market as an energy commodity.<br /><br />When a renewable energy facility earns RECs, they can either keep them or sell them to other entities such as companies that are polluting.<br /><br />Companies can then use these credits to offset their own emissions.<br /><br />In this video, we’ll discuss the basics of renewable energy credits and why you may consider using them.<br /><br />And for additional information, you can read our full blog post at: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gokcecapital.com/renewable-energy-credits/">https://gokcecapital.com/renewable-energy-credits/</a><br /><br />Sources referenced in today's story:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/24/business/energy-environment/california-rooftop-solar-utilities.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/24/business/energy-environment/california-rooftop-solar-utilities.html</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/industries-and-topics/electrical-energy/demand-side-management/net-energy-metering">https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/industries-and-topics/electrical-energy/demand-side-management/net-energy-metering</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://grist.org/energy/californias-plan-to-slash-solar-subsidies-seems-backwards-its-not/">https://grist.org/energy/californias-plan-to-slash-solar-subsidies-seems-backwards-its-not/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2021-12-16/california-plan-to-cut-solar-incentives-boiling-point">https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2021-12-16/california-plan-to-cut-solar-incentives-boiling-point</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article257749328.html">https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article257749328.html</a><br /><br />If you liked this video and are looking to buy land, you'll love our Gokce Land Due Diligence Program.
