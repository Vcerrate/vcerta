{% raw %}A cool video editor : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/3a1GTQk">http://bit.ly/3a1GTQk</a><br /><br />Adore is an Indie Action RPG creature collector and roguelite in which your only way of dealing damage is by capturing creatures and making them attack for you, This game is designed to be difficult right off the bat and you have limited resources and creature summons so you'll need to avoid letting them take damage in order to succeed.<br /><br />This year I intend to cover more small indie games alongside my normal content to hopefully find some hidden gems that don't have the recognition they deserve, currently as of making this video Adore sits at 91% positive reviews so perhaps this is one of those games?<br /><br />What do you think about Adore? Do you think it's an indie gem or do you think it still needs a lot of work? let me know in the comments below!<br />__________________________________<br />---Links---<br /><br />ExitLag: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://exitl.ag/lazypeon">https://exitl.ag/lazypeon</a> The best ping booster on the market and a must for SEA/OCE MMO players connecting to foreign game servers, code TheLazyPeon for 20% off<br /><br />Twitch TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/the_lazy_peon">http://www.twitch.tv/the_lazy_peon</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/craigtlp/">https://www.instagram.com/craigtlp/</a><br />________________________<br />---Adore Steam Description---<br /><br />Adore is a monster taming action roguelite where the main character, Lukha, is able to summon and control creatures to fight by his side in a simple and innovative way.<br />CUSTOMIZE YOUR PLAYSTYLE<br />In Adore, you can customize your game style according to the creatures you capture. Each of them has very different characteristics and abilities. Ranging from more fragile creatures, however, with high damage; slow and enduring or creatures with higher control abilities like stun and freezing.<br />On top of that there is the Synergy System, which allows for even more varied playstyles and powerful combos.<br />CREATURE COLLECTING<br />Keep your favorite creatures with you, level them up and create Bonds with them. But be careful, if they die, there is no comeback.<br />CREATURE BOND<br />Bonds are strong ties that grow between you and your creatures, creating new traits and making them unique.<br />SYNERGY SYSTEM<br />Your creature can earn synergies with other types of creatures. This means that it will activate a bonus or even change an ability when you are in control of that required type.<br />SPECIAL ABILITIES<br />Each creature also has a special ability that can be used when its energy bar is full. You have to decide when is the best moment to use the special ability, saving it for a situation where it would be more effective.<br />RANDOM GENERATION<br />Each run is a new experience. The map, all creatures, items and affinities are all randomly generated. Encouraging the player to always adapt, explore, try new compositions and different combos.<br />COMBO SYSTEM<br />Every time you break an enemy's defense, you can time attacks with different creatures to keep the enemy staggered.<br />STORY<br />Draknar, the God of the creatures is losing his power. A curse is spreading and taking control of all his creatures. His last option is Lukha, an apprentice from one of the remaining villages of Adorers. Lukha, during his journey, discovers not only many secrets of the immense and mysterious world of Gaterdrik, but also, a conspiracy to kill Draknar.<br /><br />---Tags---<br />Isometric, ARPG, Creature Collector, Roguelite, First Impressions, Review, Indie Game, Hidden Gem, Difficult Game, Undiscovered Games, Steam, Hack &amp; Slash, New Indie<br />#ARPG #IndieGame #TheLazyPeon <br />__________________________<br />Adore First Impressions &quot;Is It Worth Playing?&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/pze_WclC6DU">https://youtu.be/pze_WclC6DU</a>{% endraw %}
