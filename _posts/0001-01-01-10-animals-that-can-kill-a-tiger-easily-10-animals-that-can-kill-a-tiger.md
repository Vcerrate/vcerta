It’s powerful and considered at the top of the food chain. As much as tigers are known to prey on swift, small animals, things change when these animals become scarce as tigers are forced to cross boundaries in their search for a meal which may or may not work in their favor. They may not be the strongest but they are definitely up there. Because of this reason, not many animals are brave, powerful or tactful enough to take down a tiger. <br />Hello guys, welcome to another episode of 4 Ever Green!
