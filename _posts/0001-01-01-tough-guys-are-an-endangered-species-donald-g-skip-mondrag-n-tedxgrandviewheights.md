{% raw %}Tough Guys Are An Endangered Species contends that men in tough guy environments – military, first responders, athletes – struggle to identify, express and share their feelings. Until they seek professional help and learn to connect on a deep level with other men, they will continue to seek out high-risk activities, self-medicate with drugs and alcohol, struggle in silence with mental illness, and die by suicide in alarming numbers.<br />In Tough Guys Are An Endangered Species, Dr. Mondragon describes the circumstances that led to his depression and path to recovery.  <br /> Dr. Skip Mondragon is a U.S. Army Colonel who spent 18 months in combat zones. As a national wrestling champion and Army physician for twenty-five years, he was the epitome of a tough guy. Yet, he was beat up, beaten down, and broken by depression. <br />He is on a mission to help tough guys struggling with depression, fight the stigma of mental illness, and save men from suicide. You can reach Dr. Mondragon at skip@wrestlingisnotforwimps.com. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
