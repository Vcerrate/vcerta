{% raw %}Types of Forex Market Analysis <br /><br />Fundamental analysis is often used to analyze changes in the forex market by monitoring figures, such as interest rates, unemployment rates, gross domestic product (GDP), and other types of economic data that come out of countries. For example, a trader conducting a fundamental analysis of the EUR/USD currency pair would find information on the interest rates in the Eurozone more useful than those in the U.S. <br /><br />Those traders would also want to be on top of any significant news releases coming out of each Eurozone country to gauge the relation to the health of their economies.  The technical analysis comes in the form of both manual and automated systems. A manual system typically means a trader is analyzing technical indicators and interpreting that data into a buy or sell decision.  <br /><br />Disclaimer: <br />This video IS NOT financial advice.
