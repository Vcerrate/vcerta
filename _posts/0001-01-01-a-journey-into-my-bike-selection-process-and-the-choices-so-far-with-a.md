{% raw %}I have a very good two bikes set up, cost efficient and effective both for commuting and faster rides. My Merida Scultura 200 disc and my Canyon Ultimate CF SL 7 are perfect for my needs and still I have been thinking of a possible upgrade.<br /><br />In this ride to Windsor I explain what I finally ordered and why, not the obvious choice!<br /><br />Let me know your thoughts in the comments, thank you again for watching.<br /><br />Ciao,<br />Federico{% endraw %}
