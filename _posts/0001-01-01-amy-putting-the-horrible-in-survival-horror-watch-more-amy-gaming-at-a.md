{% raw %}Watch more Amy gaming at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/oboeshoesgames">https://www.twitch.tv/oboeshoesgames</a><br />Normally I am a big proponent of game preservation efforts, but I sincerely wish Amy wasn't still for sale on the Xbox marketplace so I could have avoided playing it. That sentence could use another draft or two but its not gonna get one cuz this game doesn't deserve it.<br /><br />Here is the link to the full playthrough if you hate yourself enough to watch it: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/A8EhJOEf-44">https://youtu.be/A8EhJOEf-44</a>{% endraw %}
