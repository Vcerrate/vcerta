I'm Erin White and this is a dailyRx Minute. While insufficient sleep may be common for teens, it can lead to weight issues. The less sleep teens got, the more likely they were to be overweight or obese. If all teens sleeping an average of seven and a half hours a night at age 18 increased their sleep to 10 hours a night, researchers predicted that 4 percent fewer teens would have body mass indexes over 25, the cutoff for being overweight. Ask your doctor about healthy sleeping habits. For dailyRx TV, I'm Erin White.{% endraw %}
