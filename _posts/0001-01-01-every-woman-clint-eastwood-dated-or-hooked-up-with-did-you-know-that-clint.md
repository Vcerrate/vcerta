{% raw %}Did you know that Clint Eastwood has had children with far more women than he has been married to, or did you think that the legendary filmmaker was as old-fashioned as he always seems? Clint Eastwood may have only been married two times over the course of his nearly century-long life, but that doesn't mean that he has only limited himself to two women! In fact, Clint can be seen as one of the most notorious womanizers in Hollywood history, with the beloved Western icon taking on as many as three affairs at a time!<br /><br />▬Contents of this video▬<br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:23 - Margaret Johnson<br />01:10 - Jayne Mansfield<br />01:29 - Mamie Van Doren<br />01:43 - Roxanne Tunis<br />02:00 - Anita Lhoest<br />02:19 - Keely Smith<br />02:33 - Jill Banner<br />02:49 - Catherine Deneuve<br />03:00 - Inger Stevens<br />03:31 - Jean Seberg<br />04:02 - Gael Greene<br />04:23 - Jo Ann Harris<br />04:37 - Cathy Reghin<br />05:00 - Sondra Locke<br />05:45 - Megan Rose<br />06:07 - Jamie Rose<br />06:17 - Jacelyn Reeves<br />06:30 - Sônia Braga<br />06:38 - Barbara Minty<br />06:46 - Barbra Streisand<br />06:55 - Jane Cameron<br />07:05 - Dani Crayne<br />07:14 - Frances Fisher<br />07:29 - Dina Ruiz<br />07:45 - Erica Tomlinson-Fisher<br />07:57 - Christina Sanders<br />08:15 - Outro<br /><br />Like this content?

Throughout their marriage, Clint cheated on Margaret numerous times. It has been rumored that one of the first extramarital affairs that Clint dabbled in was with Jayne Mansfield during his burgeoning days in Hollywood.<br /><br />As Clint became a bigger star, it became more and more difficult for him not to strike up affairs with his costars on pictures. One of the first costars that Clint hooked up with was Inger Stevens, who starred alongside Clint in the 1968 feature Hang ‘Em High. This affair kicked off a tradition of Clint becoming romantically involved with his costars that persisted for several decades.<br /><br />In between Clint’s two marriages, he was romantically involved with actress Sondra Locke for nearly two decades. This live-in relationship ended bitterly. Clint went on to marry his second wife, Dina Ruiz, in 1996, though they are now divorced.
