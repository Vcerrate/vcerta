The “-ane” past tense suffix has been added in this instance (”bhoot’zinikane”) to denote the action of fell-stitching. <br />-The imperial measuring system does seem to have finally been eradicated by the introduction of Old Tongue during the Age of Legends as no terminology for such units of measure seem to have been recorded; for our present imperial measuring purposes, however, I have selected to use the translation for OT “nail” (”hakhel”), as the nail unit of measure was our early modern precursor to today’s inch. <br /><br />(Requisite apologies to anyone who has spent years and actual effort deciphering this language, please pardon my three-hour colossal script-writing diversion which, incidentally, turned out to be a thrilling way to spend a Saturday evening. Highly recommend.)<br />--<br />[2] <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVpWkeEuUgE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVpWkeEuUgE</a> <br /><br />Useful Tools for Those So Inclined:<br />(Please note that these are affiliate links)<br />-Clear 18-inch ruler: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2DIdRrh">https://amzn.to/2DIdRrh</a><br />-Steel-headed straight pins: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ByJUaQ">https://amzn.to/2ByJUaQ</a> <br />-Every size &amp; weight needle you will probably ever need: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Sd76R7">https://amzn.to/2Sd76R7</a><br />-My most favorite (&amp; stupidly fiddly) #10 sharps, the tiniest needles: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SaZEGf">https://amzn.to/2SaZEGf</a><br />-Ye Trusty Olde 8” shears (tartan ribbon not included): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2DXkUft">https://amzn.to/2DXkUft</a><br />-Embroidery snips: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2zu9vzY">https://amzn.to/2zu9vzY</a><br /><br />Want to get started with hand sewing?<br />🕯Check out my Skillshare original course, “Hand Sewing Basics: Working Wonders with Fabric, Needle &amp; Thread”.
