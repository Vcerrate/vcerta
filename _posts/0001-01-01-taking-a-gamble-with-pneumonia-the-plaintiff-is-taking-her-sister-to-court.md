{% raw %}The plaintiff is taking her sister to court. She says the two went to a casino in Tampa, but the defendant had pneumonia and didn’t tell her. She’s suing for medical bills. The defendant admits she had pneumonia but argues there were thousands of other people at the casino that night, so there’s no way to be sure she gave it to the plaintiff. #JudgeMathis #RealityTV #Court{% endraw %}
