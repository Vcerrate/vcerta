{% raw %}Slowly But Surely <br />Lyrics: James Booker<br />Music: James Booker<br /><br />James Booker with Jerry Garcia - Palo Alto Rehersals (1976)<br /><br />Jerry Garcia -- guitar, vocals<br />John Kahn -- bass<br />James Booker -- piano, vocals<br />Ron Tutt -- drums<br /><br />I couldn't find this song on YouTube so I had to post it here myself. No copyright ... intended, it's just for bringing a little joy in your heart. Played by James Booker, one of New Orleans' true piano geniuses, with the Jerry Garcia Band in Jan 1976. The title in some lists is &quot;Right Back Together&quot; but the correct title is &quot;Slowly But Surely&quot;. <br />Jerry' s guitar picking and James Booker' s piano playing match perfectly. And the song is so optimistic. A big thanks to whoever recorded this jam session! The Piano Prince released only five official LPs of music during his lifetime. One of New Orleans' true piano geniuses who died On November 8, 1983, only 43 years old, after taking a deadly dose of bad quality cocaine.<br />=========================================<br />You know the world keeps going on around and round<br />And slowly getting back together<br />I know it's getting right back together right now<br />Sun's got the world going round and round<br />As though they're getting back together<br />I know it's getting right back together right now<br /><br />There is a great big plan<br />It's greater than superman, as great a superman<br />Tell you no lie, ['cause here is superfly, ooperfly]<br />Keeps the world running round and around and round<br />Slowly getting back together<br />I know it's getting right back together right now<br /><br />Well dead and gone, I may be dead and gone<br />Just helping the ground rotting<br />Yeah but the truth will live on<br />It never be forgotten<br />Oh but the birds and the ants<br />I know the trees and plants<br />They're gonna bring me all the news<br />It won't be no use, it won't be no use<br />Because the world still be going on around and round<br />And slowly getting back together<br />I know it know it's going to get back together, slowly but surely<br />Right back together now{% endraw %}
