However their development throughout antiquity would take place across many centuries and many civilizations. Multiple episodes will be required to discuss each of these. For now, we deal specifically with the Roman Army Cataphracts of the 1st to 5th century AD.<br /><br />What other Units of History should we cover next?<br /><br />Sources and Suggested Reading:<br />“The Development of Roman Mailed Cavalry” by John W.
