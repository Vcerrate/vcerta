{% raw %}2022 Dacia Duster review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/39bbtXE">https://carbyr.uk/39bbtXE</a><br />Watch our latest video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/carbuyervideos">http://bit.ly/carbuyervideos</a><br />Sign up to Carbuyer’s FREE newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/32TH658">https://carbyr.uk/32TH658</a> <br /><br />The Dacia Duster may not be as cheap as it used to be, but it’s still the best-value family SUV on sale right now. Opt for a mid-spec and you get all the must-have features, like a touchscreen with phone connectivity and alloy wheels, all for considerably less than a base-spec Nissan Qashqai or SEAT Ateca. The Duster offers four-wheel-drive versions if you need a cheap off-roader, and a Bi-Fuel version that’s a cheaper alternative to a hybrid SUV. Practicality is good too. Of course, the Duster’s low price means you go without luxury trimmings or particularly modern underpinnings, but is it worth a look if you’re after an inexpensive family car? Nicola puts it to the test.<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to Carbuyer for new videos every week: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/17k4fct">http://bit.ly/17k4fct</a><br /><br />Nissan Qashqai review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/3dV66xL">https://carbyr.uk/3dV66xL</a><br />Skoda Karoq review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/3r1MNsp">https://carbyr.uk/3r1MNsp</a><br />Renault Captur review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/2HUyK6a">https://carbyr.uk/2HUyK6a</a><br />Dacia Sandero review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/3Ll24hb">https://carbyr.uk/3Ll24hb</a><br /><br />4x4s and SUVs playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://carbyr.uk/2alTzoD">http://carbyr.uk/2alTzoD</a>  <br />The top 10 best 4x4s and SUVs to buy in 2022: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/2TUNemH">https://carbyr.uk/2TUNemH</a>  <br /><br />Follow us: <br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/2KkYSrv">https://carbyr.uk/2KkYSrv</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/3328zBG">https://carbyr.uk/3328zBG</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/3pOhQXK">https://carbyr.uk/3pOhQXK</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/3BbZ9U1">https://carbyr.uk/3BbZ9U1</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Auto Express magazine: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://subscribe.autoexpress.co.uk">http://subscribe.autoexpress.co.uk</a><br /><br />Carbuyer makes car buying simple.
