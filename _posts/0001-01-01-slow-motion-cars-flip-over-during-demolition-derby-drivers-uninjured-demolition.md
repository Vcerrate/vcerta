{% raw %}Demolition derby driver Allen Fuetz flipped over James Lane's car when his accelerator got stuck, before flipping over his own car, during the last race in the Demolition Derby at the Monroe County Fair, Saturday, July 6, 2019. Both drivers walked away from the crash uninjured, and the race continued until only one car was left. (Video by Jeremy Hogan/The Bloomingtonian){% endraw %}
