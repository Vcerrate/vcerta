{% raw %}Watch the prequel to this film from 2016 : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6GJFL0MD9fc">https://youtu.be/6GJFL0MD9fc</a><br /><br />In &quot;Growing Wild Together&quot; we return to the nearly 30-year-old food forest growing on the edge of a small town in the very south of Aotearoa New Zealand. The forest, previously an abandoned section filled with rubbish and burnt house remains, was the subject of our 2016 film An Invitation for Wildness. Now we’ve returned to find out what has changed in the forest and for the people who live there.<br /><br />Robyn and Robert’s forest garden is home to countless forms of life, from trees and plants to birds, fish, and insects, and of course the humans who live amongst it all, in harmony. With time it grows wilder and wilder, “Like me,” says Robert. Since we first visited, the couple have also developed new projects, one of them reviving an old trade route, to help create food resilience for the nearby rural communities.<br /><br />In the film, Robert says he’s convinced that the food forest model will be one of the most important models for creating a resilient future on Earth. He maintains we must learn to be loved by the forest. Here is a film to inspire love for our forests and everything they generously gift us!<br /><br />** Find out more about Robert and Robyn's work: **<br />The Longwood Loop<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.longwoodloop.co.nz">https://www.longwoodloop.co.nz</a><br /><br />The Environment Centre<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sces.org.nz/">https://www.sces.org.nz/</a><br /><br />** Find out more about Happen Films **<br />If you’re interested in supporting us to make more films, check out these options:<br />Open Collective: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://opencollective.com/happenfilms">https://opencollective.com/happenfilms</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/happenfilms">https://patreon.com/happenfilms</a> <br /><br />For more info about Happen Films, check out our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://happenfilms.com">https://happenfilms.com</a> <br />We make short films and feature films, all with a permaculture, resilience, sustainability focus.
