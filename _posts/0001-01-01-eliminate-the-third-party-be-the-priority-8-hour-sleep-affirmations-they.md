You create the breakup, getting your ex back, being broke, great friendships, that job you hate- you manifest it all with your dominant habitual subconscious thinking. Most of the time, you don‚Äôt even realise you‚Äôre doing it. So, if things look bad in your life right now, don‚Äôt worry, because YOU can change it. <br /><br />Hi guys, I‚Äôm Loz. You may know me from ‚ÄòSubconscious Loz‚Äô‚Ä¶my Tiktok and my live Q+A - where I bang on, (and often scream) about creating the life you want and I‚Äôm here to show you how to start seeing yourself as the queen or king who gets everything they want by combining psychology, the principles of manifestation and the life experiences which forced me to drag my concept of myself out of the f*cking toilet.<br /><br /> Oh and if you haven‚Äôt noticed, I swear a lot. So you‚Äôve been warned‚Ä¶And if I start yelling, I‚Äôm just trying to shake some f*cking sense into you. (I do it with love.)<br /><br />Understanding the Law of Assumption has changed my life, and I hope can help change yours with everything I‚Äôve learned...the success and the failures!<br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è <br />Loz <br /><br />#manifest #affirmations #getridofthethirdparty <br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Videos may include curse words, and triggering content about childhood experiences.
