{% raw %}Game of Thrones, Game of Thrones 6x06 - Blood of My Blood, Game of Thrones  Walder Frey (David Bradley) <br /><br />You've lost it? Yes, Father. It's a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didn't lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you. He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone. You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn't find him. That's what it means to lose something. Now he's come back and taken Riverrun. I don't think it's fair to blame us For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back. We don't have the men. We've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish. The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods. The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps. Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year. If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge. They're laughing at us. All across the Riverlands right down to King's Landing, they're laughing at us. I hear it in my sleep! I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you. And I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter. Take that castle back. He'll never yield, Father. Oh, he'll yield.{% endraw %}
