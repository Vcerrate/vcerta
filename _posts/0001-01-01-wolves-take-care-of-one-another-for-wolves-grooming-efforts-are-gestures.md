{% raw %}For wolves, grooming efforts are gestures of intimacy that reaffirm emotional bonds.<br /><br />Ultimately, wolf families are just like ours; they play together, eat together, groom one another, and most importantly, love together.<br /><br />When it comes to wolves it's all about family.<br /><br />Alawa and Zephyr are captive born gray wolves at the Wolf Conservation Center (WCC), a 501c3 non-profit organization, in South Salem, NY. They are 'ambassador wolves' at the WCC that help teach the public about wolves and their vital role in the environment. <br /><br />If you want to watch Zephyr, Alawa, Nikai or the WCC's critically endangered Mexican gray wolves or red wolves in live time, visit our live wolf webcams at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nywolf.org/webcams​.">http://www.nywolf.org/webcams​.</a> If you see something cool, let us know!<br /><br />For more information about wolves and the WCC's participation in wolf recovery, please visit our website at www.nywolf.org.<br /><br />Follow us on Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/nywolforg​">https://www.facebook.com/nywolforg​</a><br />Find us on Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/nywolforg​">https://twitter.com/nywolforg​</a><br />Find us on Twitch - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/wolfconservationcenter">https://www.twitch.tv/wolfconservationcenter</a><br />And on Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/wolfconservationcenter">https://www.instagram.com/wolfconservationcenter</a>{% endraw %}
