{% raw %}You want your clothes to fit better, but the thought of going to the tailor is intimidating, and you don't know where to start. This video outlines the exact 5 step process I use to find a tailor, test them out and nurture a long-term relationship.<br /><br />Fit is the most important aspect of style. If you don't believe this, look at the old photos of me in this post. You can see how I used to dress before I understood the importance of fit.<br /><br />Wearing clothes that fit will literally make you look taller, thinner and even more athletic. But if you wear clothes that fit poorly, you will look shorter, fatter and less competent that you really are. At the end of the day, the best way to make sure your clothes fit is to get them tailored.<br /><br />I'm talking about good old fashioned clothing alterations. Because the reality is, clothes are mass manufactured to fit the average male, who happens to be 5'9″ and slightly overweight. If you're already getting your clothes tailored, good for you! You've taken the most important step toward dressing well everyday.<br /><br />If you've never been to the tailor, it's okay. I understand. Going to the tailor for the first time can be intimidating. You're probably wondering: How do I find a good clothing tailor? What do I tell them? Do I have to know my measurements? What if they mess up my clothes? Is it going to be expensive? What if I waste my money?<br /><br />These are all legitimate concerns, but I promise you have nothing to be worried about. I'm going to teach you how to find a tailor, how to “test” them out and how to build a lasting relationship.<br />—<br />BEST YOUTUBE MUSIC → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/UhwtMb">https://goo.gl/UhwtMb</a><br />—<br />SHOP THE VIDEO<br />▪ Jacket → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fave.co/2sVTemP">http://fave.co/2sVTemP</a><br />▪ Polo (similar) → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fave.co/2t1VtVo">http://fave.co/2t1VtVo</a><br />—<br />RELATED VIDEOS<br />▪ Clothing Brans for Short Men → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/zy9NCwKYPxg">https://youtu.be/zy9NCwKYPxg</a><br />▪ How T-Shirts Should Fit → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/XwZx10-1ou4">https://youtu.be/XwZx10-1ou4</a><br />—<br />MY GEAR<br />▪ Canon T6i → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://geni.us/4kSX">http://geni.us/4kSX</a><br />▪ Laptop → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fave.co/2hgKaDF">http://fave.co/2hgKaDF</a><br />▪ Laptop stand → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fave.co/2vQwBj3">http://fave.co/2vQwBj3</a><br />▪ Lens #1 (50mm) → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://geni.us/OiE9">http://geni.us/OiE9</a><br />▪ Lens #2 (10-18mm) → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://geni.us/qgGQckE">http://geni.us/qgGQckE</a><br />▪ Lens #3 (24mm) → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://geni.us/x61A">http://geni.us/x61A</a><br />▪ Lav mic → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://geni.us/ZBlvGh">http://geni.us/ZBlvGh</a><br />▪ Desk mic → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://geni.us/wCdS7t2">http://geni.us/wCdS7t2</a><br />—<br />YOUTUBE MUSIC → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/UhwtMb">https://goo.gl/UhwtMb</a><br />—<br />STYLE GUIDES<br />▪ Free E-Books → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://mdst.mn/guide-pack">http://mdst.mn/guide-pack</a><br />▪ Premium Guide → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://mdst.mn/tmmsg">http://mdst.mn/tmmsg</a><br />—<br />FOLLOW ME<br />▪ Podcast → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fave.co/2vej94M">http://fave.co/2vej94M</a><br />▪ Instagram → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/modestmanstyle/">https://www.instagram.com/modestmanstyle/</a><br />▪ Twitter → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/modestmanstyle">https://twitter.com/modestmanstyle</a><br />▪ Facebook → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/modestmanblog/">https://www.facebook.com/modestmanblog/</a><br />▪ Private Group → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/modestmen">https://www.facebook.com/groups/modestmen</a><br />—<br />Contains affiliate links // Stay stylish!{% endraw %}
