{% raw %}Zelenskyy says the situation in Mariupol was “inhuman” and called on allies to provide heavy weapons in order to save the city from Russian forces.<br /><br />“The situation in Mariupol remains as severe as possible – just inhuman. This is what the Russian Federation did, and deliberately continues to destroy cities. It is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there in Mariupol,” said the president.<br /><br />Bodies lie on streets in the besieged port city of Mariupol where Russian forces again claimed they had taken full control of a steel plant.<br /><br />Ukrainian army denies that, saying marines and members of the Azov battalion are still defending their positions in the giant Soviet built factory - in a city almost completely destroyed and from where thousands of civilians have been unable to escape.<br /><br /><br /><br />Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford reports from Kyiv.<br /><br /><br /><br />- Subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://aje.io/AJSubscribe">http://aje.io/AJSubscribe</a> <br /><br />- Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AJEnglish">https://twitter.com/AJEnglish</a> <br /><br />- Find us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera">https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera</a> <br /><br />- Check our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/">https://www.aljazeera.com/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />#UkraineWar #Zelenskyy #Mariupol{% endraw %}
