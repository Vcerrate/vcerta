{% raw %}Non-native English speakers often find it difficult to paraphrase English text, which leads to issues with plagiarism. Editage Premium Editing helps you ensure your paper is polished for language, formatting, and plagiarism. Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3cQy4KN">https://bit.ly/3cQy4KN</a> <br /><br />Authors build their research on previously published papers, often relying on data, methods, and processes used in earlier studies. However, this needs to be written in an authorâ€™s own words or properly credited, even if you are referring to your own work, to avoid any ethical misconduct. This makes summarizing text in English by rephrasing English sentences from published articles a must-have skill for researchers. <br /><br />However, using your own words to paraphrase English text is a challenge, especially if English is not your first language or the text is very technical. This is why many non-English speaking authors are unable to clear the plagiarism check at the journal desk screening stage. <br /><br />In this video, John McDonald, a peer reviewer, experienced editor, and academic trainer at Editage with 15+ years of teaching experience, talks about the need to write in your own words to avoid unintentional plagiarism. He shares three valuable tips and uses examples of paraphrased sentences to explain how to rephrase English sentences easily and effectively.
