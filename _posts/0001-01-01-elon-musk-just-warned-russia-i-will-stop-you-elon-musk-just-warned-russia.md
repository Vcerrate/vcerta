{% raw %}Elon Musk JUST WARNED Russia: &quot;WE WILL STOP YOU!&quot;<br />🔔 Subscribe - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3myAZOn">https://bit.ly/3myAZOn</a><br /><br />Elon Musk has sent a truck containing numerous Starlink terminals at the request of the Minister of digital transformation of Ukraine. This development will facilitate uninterrupted satellite internet in the country. <br />The trajectory of the orbits of Starlink satellites launched in the first phase will serve the whole territory of Ukraine. With this, access to satellite internet will be the least of Ukraine’s worries. Although it might be somewhat risky for Ukrainian citizens to utilize Starlink right now, it is hard to know who will receive the terminal. Chances are, government officials and the military will be the first set of people to utilize it. <br />Right now, you should understand that Starlink is highly beneficial to Ukraine because it can assist Ukraine in accessing the internet amid the invasion of Russia. Therefore, a set of Starlink terminals has arrived in Ukraine at the request of the country's Minister of digital transformation, who sought help from SpaceX’s CEO, Elon Musk, to ensure that Ukraine has a steady internet connection at their disposal.<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />About Elon Musk Live<br />🎥 Videos about Elon Musk, SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, The Boring Company and more.<br />🔔 Subscribe for more Elon Musk, SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, The Boring Company and more.<br />📝 Written, voiced and produced by Elon Musk Live<br /><br />Watch More Elon Musk Live Videos Here:<br />👑 Elon Musk: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...</a><br />🚀 SpaceX: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...</a><br />🚗 Tesla: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...</a><br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />⚠️ Copyright Disclaimers<br />• Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act states: “Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.” <br />• We use images and content in accordance with the YouTube Fair Use copyright guidelines<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />#elon #musk #russia{% endraw %}
