{% raw %}This is the gear I'll be using on the Pacific Crest Trail starting around May 15th. A baseweight of 6.6lbs, which is all the gear I will have for this entire trail to keep me comfortable and happy! This is not much different from the gear I have used on every other trail I have hiked, and all of those past experiences on long trails around the US have culminated into this one.<br /><br />The Pacific Crest Trail is 2,650 miles from Mexico to Canada across the states of California, Oregon, and Washington. I am starting this hike later than typical in an effort to avoid snow and colder temperatures, allowing me to carry less gear and hike a bit faster more comfortably. Still in the beginning temperatures in the desert will be very hot, and certainly it will still get below freezing in the Sierra Nevada mountains.<br /><br />My goal is to hike this trail in 100 days or less, but I am flexible and would be happy with more. I want to do it this way as I enjoy the big mile days and pushing myself, I enjoy the extra challenge, and a faster hike typically means a cheaper hike. Either way, whether faster or slower, I am just happy to be getting out there.<br /><br />MY GEAR LIST (Weights, names, links)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jupiterhikes.com/gear/">https://jupiterhikes.com/gear/</a><br /><br />At this point I have hiked a fair amount and am really comfortable with what I use. I am comfortable in my experience from past thru hikes and the skills I've learned to carry very little safely and happily.<br /><br />On the Appalachian Trail I carried a sub 6lb base weight, the Pacific Northwest Trail, Arizona Trail, Sheltowee Trace Trail, and my two Florida Trail thru hikes were not much different. I've always wanted to have a minimal gear setup while out backpacking. Both to avoid potential injuries by carrying less weight, to focus more on the trail rather than the gear, and to hopefully be more efficient while hiking to get the most out of every moment. It has been a fun journey into minimalism through backpacking and hiking. I wouldn't change a thing.<br /><br />Though I've greatly enjoyed doing a lot of smaller and less known thru hikes, I am very excited to be returning to the PCT in my journey towards the triple crown. I've dreamed of this trail since 2016, and now is finally my chance to do it.<br /><br />Mentioned in this video:<br />Shorts - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/36VWUJV">https://amzn.to/36VWUJV</a><br />Shirt - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3LHGLGC">https://amzn.to/3LHGLGC</a><br />Shoes - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3u6FMKm">https://amzn.to/3u6FMKm</a><br />Watch - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3r29XQM">https://amzn.to/3r29XQM</a><br />Hat - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cieleathletics.com/">https://cieleathletics.com/</a><br /><br />Backpack - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://palantepacks.com/">https://palantepacks.com/</a><br />Pack Liner - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gossamergear.com/">https://www.gossamergear.com/</a><br />Quilt - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://enlightenedequipment.com/">https://enlightenedequipment.com/</a><br />Sleeping Pad - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gossamergear.com/">https://www.gossamergear.com/</a><br />Tarp - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://zpacks.com/">https://zpacks.com/</a><br />Tent Stakes - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3bKgoRq">https://amzn.to/3bKgoRq</a><br />Ground Cloth - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Kcrwp0">https://amzn.to/3Kcrwp0</a><br /><br />Wind Pants - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3j5MlXd">https://amzn.to/3j5MlXd</a><br />Rain Jacket - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://enlightenedequipment.com/">https://enlightenedequipment.com/</a><br />Fleece - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kuiu.com/">https://www.kuiu.com/</a><br />Socks - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3DDlk73">https://amzn.to/3DDlk73</a><br />Beanie - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://zpacks.com/">https://zpacks.com/</a><br />Sun Glasses - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ombraz.com/">https://ombraz.com/</a><br />Bug Headnet - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3NKSkyP">https://amzn.to/3NKSkyP</a><br /><br />Spoon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3cA3mVG">https://amzn.to/3cA3mVG</a><br />Food Bag - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3rOVfeu">https://amzn.to/3rOVfeu</a><br />Water Filter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3LFuAua">https://amzn.to/3LFuAua</a><br />Bear Can - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Mtsi2u">https://amzn.to/3Mtsi2u</a><br /><br />Trowel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3u6VIMr">https://amzn.to/3u6VIMr</a><br />Knife - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3r3psb7">https://amzn.to/3r3psb7</a><br />Toothbrush - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3tkN4GY">https://amzn.to/3tkN4GY</a><br />Floss - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3FnONTa">https://amzn.to/3FnONTa</a><br />Lighter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3zLQkyD">https://amzn.to/3zLQkyD</a><br />Blister Tape - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3qZ55f9">https://amzn.to/3qZ55f9</a><br />Chaffe Cream - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3bNorNu">https://amzn.to/3bNorNu</a><br />Lip Balm - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35Gs1Zk">https://amzn.to/35Gs1Zk</a><br />Sunscreen - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3wadTRt">https://amzn.to/3wadTRt</a><br /><br />Flashlight - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3tmjRM6">https://amzn.to/3tmjRM6</a><br />Camera - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3uMp7MW">https://amzn.to/3uMp7MW</a><br />Memory Card - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3vrBOdZ">https://amzn.to/3vrBOdZ</a><br />Tripod - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3eEFAL6">https://amzn.to/3eEFAL6</a><br />Headphones - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3KhEPVi">https://amzn.to/3KhEPVi</a><br />Micro Fiber Cloth - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/38FIyLh">https://amzn.to/38FIyLh</a><br />External Battery - Ravpower PD Pioneer 20,000mAh 60w<br />Wall Charger - Ravpower PD Pioneer 30w 2-Port<br /><br />Hiking Essentials Shirt!
