{% raw %}This poor little dog somehow got his head stuck in a cinder block wall. A first responder with the Arizona Humane Society carefully chipped away at the wall to help free the 2-year-old American Pit Bull-Terrier mix. Finally the opening was big enough for Buddyâ€™s head to be freed. He was taken to an animal hospital to be treated for some minor wounds. Once given the all clear, Buddy was reunited with his loving owner.{% endraw %}
