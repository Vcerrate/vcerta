{% raw %}Here are the names and links to everything we did and the hotel stayed in. <br /><br />- St George's hotel, Wembley<br />            - It's only a 25-30 min tube journey into central London<br />- Winter wonderland Hydepark<br />            - Be prepared to spend your money! Some rides were £9 each!!<br />- Crazy golf -  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.plonkgolf.co.uk/venue/camden/">https://www.plonkgolf.co.uk/venue/camden/</a><br />            - £13pp <br />- The alchemist old street - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thealchemist.uk.com/venues/old-street/">https://thealchemist.uk.com/venues/old-street/</a><br />            - I'd recommend the cocktail 'lightbulb moment' and 'The colour<br />              changing one'        <br />- The bar we went to - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.oldstreetrecords.com">https://www.oldstreetrecords.com</a><br />            - Drinks were a bit pricey but the vibe in there was amazing and<br />              they played great music. Some of it live. <br />- The place we ate breakfast - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://toimoicafe.co.uk/contact.html">https://toimoicafe.co.uk/contact.html</a><br />- The Cafe at the end of the vlog - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.feya.co.uk/feya-bond-street">https://www.feya.co.uk/feya-bond-street</a><br />             - The food was amazing here and the staff are lovely but it was <br />                very very pricey, so I wouldn't recommend if you are looking for<br />                an inexpensive meal.{% endraw %}
