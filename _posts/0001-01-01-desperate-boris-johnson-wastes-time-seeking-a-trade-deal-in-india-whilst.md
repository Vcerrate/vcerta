{% raw %}Whilst MP's debated whether Boris Johnson had deliberately misled the House he flew to India in search of trade deals. With UK exports to India at £7.7 billion as against Belgium £18.8 billion India is hardly a major market for the UK and it appears that little progress was made in talks. Any trade agreement eventually reached, the Indians have made clear, will require the U.K. issuing large numbers of visas for Indians wanting to come to the U.K. to work. Since India has a large I.T. sector it is likely that many of those wanting to visit the U.K. will be I.T. technicians who are likely to be prepared to work for much lower pay than current levels. In addition sourcing 'the brightest and the best' from countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nigeria immigration is almost certain to increase.{% endraw %}
