{% raw %}I recorded these originally for the USRowing Olympic Development Program Camp in summer of 2021. These exercises fit the available equipment of the camp facilities and athletes in attendance from beginner (no/limited experience), intermediate (some experience), and advanced. These videos are not designed to be comprehensive or a replacement for coaching, but to provide example demonstrations of major exercises.<br /><br />www.RowingStronger.com<br /><br />strengthcoachwill@gmail.com{% endraw %}
