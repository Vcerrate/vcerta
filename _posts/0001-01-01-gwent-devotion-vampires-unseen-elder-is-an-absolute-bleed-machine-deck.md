Furthermore, the strategy behind the deck is explained so that you have an understanding of what to aim for.<br /><br />I will now outline the strengths and weakness of this deck so they made aid you in your performance:<br /><br />Strengths: <br />The deck performs best dragging the match out across multiple rounds. You literally want to bleed the opponent in round 2 with all of your strong engines/leader ability, making them commit important combinations, and then in a short round 3 you can rely on Mammuna and Regis: Reborn for some big points. The amount of bleeding and boosting we accumulate through our engines can catch opponents off guard and cause them to make mistakes, because there are a lot of extra calculations to be considered.<br /><br />Weaknesses: <br />Control decks are our biggest weakness as we are running multiple engine units. Also decks which carry tall punish have an advantage over us, as we have units such as Fleder and Orianna growing big in power as the round progresses. A worst case scenario for this deck would be a long round 3 against a heavy control build, so don't be afraid to push a little harder in those matchups to win round control to avoid that.<br /><br />These are just some brief points that i have shared, if you would like to learn more about the list please watch the video for a detailed explanation.<br /><br />Thank you for your time and support!<br /><br />KG{% endraw %}
