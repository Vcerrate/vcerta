{% raw %}Hey Everyone,<br /><br />Welcome to the last video of this sailing season! Hope you guys have enjoyed traveling with us as much as we have enjoyed sharing our adventure with all of YOU!! When you see a squall usually there is a way to avoid it, but there was no avoiding this monstrosity. See how we manage when we get hit with 30-40 knot gusts without a working engine. After a night full of turbulence we finally see land in site!! <br /><br />Want to support our travels and get an early peak at our videos?!
