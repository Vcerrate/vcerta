{% raw %}Today I’m sharing 13 things I don’t do or buy to save money. Minimalism is something that has dramatically impacted my buying habits, helping me to save money and slowly make changes to live more intentionally. So in this video, I’m sharing 13  things that I USED to buy regularly or have bought in the past, but since adopting minimalism, I no longer do. <br /><br />NOTE: Please keep in mind that we’re all different, just because something doesn’t serve me, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t buy it. Think of this video as inspiration, I’m not here to tell you what you should or shouldn’t buy. Take away from this the ideas you like and leave the rest. <br /><br />► MENTIONED<br />    » Ronald L.
