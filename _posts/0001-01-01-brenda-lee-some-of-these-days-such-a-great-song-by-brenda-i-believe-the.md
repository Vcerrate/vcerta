{% raw %}Such a great song by Brenda, I believe the original artist was Sophie Tucker, she recorded it first in 1911, it reached the #1 position on the charts for five weeks beginning November 23, 1926, after she re-released it, it's a wonderful song, and Brenda did herself proud here, enjoy, Dave{% endraw %}
