{% raw %}What is HDMI Pass-Through? This term often appears in our videos though many viewers barely know about this immensely useful technology. Let's find out more about HDMI-Passthrough.<br /><br />‘Passthrough’ is the ability to pass signals unaltered though a device to another. Generally associated with HDMI, it passes video and audio signals from a  from a high definition (HD) source such as a Blu-ray player or a HD set top box to a home theatre system (HTS) via a HDMI cable.  The system plays the audio from the HD source through its own speakers and sends the unaltered video signal to a TV via a second HDMI cable. You’ll find these functions mostly with HDMI supported devices such as AV Receivers, Soundbars &amp; Televisions<br /><br />A home theatre system that supports HDMI pass-through will have one HDMI OUT port to send the HDMI signal to a TV, and at least one HDMI IN port to receive a HDMI signal from the connected external device.<br /><br />Visit www.ooberpad.com to get the latest IMAX Enhanced certified gears.<br /><br />Music: zeropage - Ambiphonic (The song is permitted for commercial use under license “Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)“”) #homecinema{% endraw %}
