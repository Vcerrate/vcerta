{% raw %}You’re on the Dashing Axe channel, and in this video we’ll make a crazy project that took more than one month of work, a lot of technical difficulties, buckets of epoxy resin, success and disappointment - all this in one short video. And in the end we get a transparent hood for the car. Enjoy watching.{% endraw %}
