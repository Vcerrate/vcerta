{% raw %}Aaron Rodgers shared some Monday Night Gratitude, but the entire message seemed a bit cryptic. The Packers QB posted a lengthy caption on Instagram, accompanied by a series of photos, where he reflected on his former fianc√©e Shailene Woodley. &quot;Thanks for always having my back, for the incredible kindness you show me and everyone you meet, and for showing me what unconditional love looks like, I love you and am grateful for you,&quot; he wrote.{% endraw %}
