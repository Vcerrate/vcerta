{% raw %}The Greastwood British EBF Stakes has been won by subsequent Group 1 winners Great Heavens, Speedy Boarding and Sea Of Class in the last decade and Stay Alert certainly looks another promising winner of the Listed highlight at Newbury, coming clear of as good field under jockey Josephine Gordon for trainer Hughie Morrison.<br /><br />Stay Alert found Nashwa only too good last time but proved much the best on this occasion and her trainer mused some potential big races afterwards. This win was over 10 furlongs, but Stay Alert is related to some stout stayers and the trainer nominated the St Leger as a potential end-of-season target in the aftermath. <br /><br />This was a huge success for Josephine Gordon too and arguably the story of the race. The rider was winning lots of good races a few seasons ago when regularly riding for Hugo Palmer but she has had to endure leaner times since, with this victory provingh a first stakes success for two and a half years.<br /><br />You just need that one horse, Gordon says afterwards to Rishi Persad, as she hopes to climb the ranks once again.<br /><br /><br />This is the official YouTube channel of Racing TV.<br /> <br />Racing TV is the UK's leading horse racing channel showing live racing from the best racecourses in Great Britain and Ireland.<br /> <br />Subscribe to Racing TV's free YouTube channel and get closer to the sport we all love.
