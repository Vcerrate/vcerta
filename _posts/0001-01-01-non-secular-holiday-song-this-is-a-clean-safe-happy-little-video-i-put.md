{% raw %}This is a clean, safe, happy little video I put together that is 100% religiously safe.  If you are a staff member at my school and want to punish me for having the screaming guy with the belt punish the other bleeding bald guy on the floor, you have no leg to stand on.  This is a personal account, that section of the video wasn't shown on the morning announcements, and that section was thrown in there for the enjoyment of me and my peers, not meant for everyone.  <br /><br />This is the section where I talk about not owning any of these things and yadda yadda yadda.  Credit to Paul McCartney, idubbbz, Jii, JoeysWorldTour, etc, etc, etc.  Playing this at the office &quot;holiday&quot; party will make you the coolest cat around.{% endraw %}
