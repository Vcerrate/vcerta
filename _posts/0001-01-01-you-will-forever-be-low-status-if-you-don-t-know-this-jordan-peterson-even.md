{% raw %}Even though some hate to believe it status and hierarchies do exist in human and animal societies all around the world. When many people think of status they think of greedy rich people, however that is not the case. There are many ways to have status across many domains, and they don't have to all be about power. This is why many people like to call themselves alpha or sigma males. In this video, Jordan Peterson talks about status, specifically low status people and how it actually effects your mood. Many people don't know that your status has large effects on your mood and your ability to overcome obstacles and goals. Doctor Jordan Peterson tells us how primal we really are by comparing us to lobsters. His advice will help you transform your low status self to a high status person and get you feeling better in no time.<br /><br />You Will FOREVER Be Low Status if You Don't Know This... - Jordan Peterson<br /><br />LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE!<br /><br />Buy Jordan Peterson's Books!<br />12 Rules for Life: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3oQm42x">https://amzn.to/3oQm42x</a><br />Beyond Order: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Bn4xDW">https://amzn.to/3Bn4xDW</a><br />Maps of Meaning: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3gLfw0u">https://amzn.to/3gLfw0u</a><br /><br />Speaker: Jordan Peterson<br />Follow Jordan Peterson:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JordanPeter...">https://www.youtube.com/c/JordanPeter...</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JordanBPete...">https://www.youtube.com/c/JordanBPete...</a><br /><br />Videos:<br />Music/Videos/Animations are licensed through Envato Elements<br />Some Via Pexels.com and Pixabay.com<br /><br />â–ºFAIR-USE COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER<br /><br />* Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
