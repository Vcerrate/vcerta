{% raw %}Sky News host Peta Credlin says “true to form” US President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address wasn’t without “a couple of embarrassing gaffes”. <br /><br />US President Joe Biden has delivered his first State of the Union address - speaking about the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and a number of domestic issues. <br /><br />“All staged for the cameras,” Ms Credlin said.  <br /><br />“Now, in terms of content, unsurprisingly, President Biden had strong words for Vladimir Putin over the invasion of Ukraine. <br /><br />“But true to form, President Biden’s speech wasn’t without a couple of embarrassing gaffes, including this one where he appeared to confuse Ukraine with another country more than 3,000 kilometres away.”{% endraw %}
