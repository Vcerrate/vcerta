{% raw %}Gabby Petito disappears after cross-country trip with her boyfriend. What happened to Gabby Petito? Gabby &amp; Brian Playlist <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvo47zlhLxO4jLMAfvOyjLHg6o2C5LI0P">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvo47zlhLxO4jLMAfvOyjLHg6o2C5LI0P</a><br /><br />New Van sighting video link <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/PBp3aNAGuFM">https://youtu.be/PBp3aNAGuFM</a> Red White &amp; Bethune channel.<br /><br />Gabby Petito, 22, of Blue Point, Long Island, was last seen on 24 August when she checked out of a Salt Lake City hotel with her partner of two and half years, Brian Laundrie. She was reported missing by her family on the evening of 11 September, said police.<br /><br />Ms Petito and Mr Laundrie had been documenting their travel experiences as â€˜van-lifersâ€™ across the US on a YouTube channel called â€˜Nomadic Statikâ€™. She would regularly FaceTime her mother, but her mother grew worried when she hadnâ€™t heard from her for days and notified the authorities.<br /><br />North Port police told Dailymail.com Laundrie's parents refused to let authorities interview their son at their home Saturday and admitted that the sudden disappearance of the 22-year-old is 'odd.' <br /><br />'We have not talked with him, we would love to talk to him,' said North Port Police spokesman Josh Taylor.  <br /><br />'He is under no obligation to talk to us â€“ and he has not. And we don't even know yet if a crime happened.'<br /><br />Asked if police had turned up at the home of Laundrie's parents to speak with him, Taylor replied: 'Of course.'<br /><br />He added: 'We did not actually talk to him. We talked to his parents. And they did not want to make him available to do that.'   <br /><br />Laundrie's father, 62-year-old Christopher Laundrie, was seen mowing his lawn on Monday, and refused to comment on his son's whereabouts. <br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/ickedmel">https://discord.gg/ickedmel</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ickedmel.com">https://www.ickedmel.com</a> Merchâœ…<br />Email: ickedmel@ickedmel.com ðŸ’»<br />Cash APP Link <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cash.app/$iCkEdMeL">https://cash.app/$iCkEdMeL</a><br />PayPal <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/iCkEdMeL">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/iCkEdMeL</a><br />Membershipsâœ…  ðŸ‘‡<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyRpIP6Psss_KOY1OLK-lXg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyRpIP6Psss_KOY1OLK-lXg/join</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/becomesupporter/1770570213272304/">https://www.facebook.com/becomesupporter/1770570213272304/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/iCkEdMeL/">https://www.facebook.com/iCkEdMeL/</a> <br />Amazon Affiliate LinkðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2Dqp7Yy">http://amzn.to/2Dqp7Yy</a> âœ… <br />My PC Hardware &amp; Supplement Store ðŸ‘‡<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/ickedmel">https://www.amazon.com/shop/ickedmel</a> (Affiliate)<br />Spotify Podcast <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0bEabac9Xj024AiUxgnes0">https://open.spotify.com/show/0bEabac9Xj024AiUxgnes0</a><br />Apple Pod <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ickedmel/id1552519012?uo=4">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ickedmel/id1552519012?uo=4</a><br /><br />FAIR-USE COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER:<br />Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
