{% raw %}A whopping 94% of all life-forms on Earth are aquatic. Such a huge number of living beings who can't survive without water is understandable. After all, more than 70% of our planet's surface is covered with water. The World Ocean includes the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean. There's enough water in the oceans to fill a 685-mile-long bathtub! One of the main nagging questions people have been asking for ages is &quot;How deep is the ocean in reality?&quot; Let’s find an answer to it. <br /><br />#marianatrench #deepplace #deepocean<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS<br />Sunlit zone 1:21<br />Twilight zone 6:17<br />Midnight zone 10:19<br />The abyss 13:17<br />Trench zone 14:25<br /><br />Music: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music">https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music</a><br /><br />SUMMARY<br />-The Sunlit zone stretches from 14.5 ft, that is is the depth of a standard Olympic diving pool, to 561 ft under the water’s surface, where RMS Carpathia found her last dwelling. This ship became famous after her participation in the rescue of the Titanic survivors.<br />-At 656 ft, the twilight zone begins. That's where you can see the giant oarfish. At a depth of 1,453 ft, you could reach the height of the Empire State Building if somebody powerful enough decided to submerge it under the water. The giant squid lives as deep as 2,952 ft below the surface. This is where the Twilight zone ends.<br />-At a depth of 3,608 ft, there's the deepest volcano recorded by scientists. At 12,795 ft below the water’s surface, there are Air France flight 447 black boxes. Airbus A330 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. This is where the Midnight zone ends. <br />-At a depth of 13,123 ft, the midnight zone ends, and the abyss lies ahead. 18,897 ft is the bottom of the abyss and the depth at which you can find the deepest shipwreck. SS Rio Grande sunk in 1941 in the South Atlantic and was discovered only in 1996.<br />-At a depth of 19,685 ft, the abyss ends and gives way to the trench zone. At a depth of 36,070 ft, you will reach the very bottom of the ocean in its deepest point known to man: Challenger Deep.   <br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br /><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
