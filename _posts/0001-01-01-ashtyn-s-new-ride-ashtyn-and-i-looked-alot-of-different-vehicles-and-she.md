{% raw %}** Ashtyn and I looked alot of different vehicles and she decided on the Chevy Tahoe and I decided on the engine. So we went with the new 3L Diesel RST and we did not custom order this suv, it just so happened to be ordered by the dealership and we put our names on it.<br /><br />I do prefer diesels if given the choice, it's easier for us to run everything diesel (one fuel in everything) and then we do not need a gas tank or ever worry about mixing up the gas/diesel.<br /><br />I do not like def though, and if/when it gives trouble, the def will leave 🤷‍♂️😆<br /><br /><br />** For more fun, weekly polls, pictures, flash backs, Ashtyn &amp; Chapel, and more interactive content check our Patreon Account! 🙂 <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=25010547">https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=25010547</a><br /><br />** Also check out our website to learn a little more about our family farm. <br /><br />And we're excited to see our new Merchandise slowly trickling in, hopefully we'll be getting that on our website soon.
