{% raw %}When Red Bull launched a show car earlier this month, then didn’t release anything from its shakedown, it was clear that Adrian Newey’s latest creation was being kept as secret as possible, for as long as possible. <br /><br />As soon as the car appeared, it became very clear why Red Bull wanted to keep it under wraps. The sidepod design, with the most aggressive undercut we’ve seen that effectively makes the floor and the sidepods completely separate before they come together further down the car, is just one of the many bold design characteristics of the RB18. It even has what The Race’s technical expert Gary Anderson likens to a double diffuser. <br /><br />Of course, being unconventional and aggressive doesn’t always mean you are the fastest. But given Red Bull and Newey’s track record, this car looks set to make a big impact for all the right reasons. <br /> <br />And if you want to keep up with everything that’s going on at F1 testing at Barcelona - which is not on TV this year - make sure you check out The Race Live Hub on our website where our team on the ground in Spain will be providing regular updates for the-race.com<br /><br />#F1testing #RedBull #F12022<br /><br />READ MORE HERE<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://the-race.com/formula-1/gary-andersons-verdict-on-red-bulls-2022-formula-1-car/">https://the-race.com/formula-1/gary-andersons-verdict-on-red-bulls-2022-formula-1-car/</a><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://the-race.com/youtube_subscribe">http://the-race.com/youtube_subscribe</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://the-race.com/">http://the-race.com/</a><br />Twitter: @wearetherace<br />Instagram: @wearetherace<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/wearetherace">http://facebook.com/wearetherace</a><br />Podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://the-race.com/podcasts">http://the-race.com/podcasts</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching - please like, share and comment, please also hit subscribe to show your support so we'll keep doing what we're doing.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.the-race.com">https://www.the-race.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/wearetherace">http://www.twitter.com/wearetherace</a>{% endraw %}
