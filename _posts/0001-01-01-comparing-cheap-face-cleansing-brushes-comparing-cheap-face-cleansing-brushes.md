{% raw %}Comparing CHEAP Face Cleansing Brushes<br />Today, I'm comparing four different face cleansing brushes up against each other to see which one cleanses my face the best from full face of makeup. All of these face cleansing brushes can be found on Amazon under $30. I love wearing makeup, but cleaning my face at the end of the night is equivilant to taking off the bra. Ha. What is your preferred method to melt off your makeup and clean your face at the end of the night? <br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/224Ax7F">http://bit.ly/224Ax7F</a><br /><br />Products Used/Mentioned: <br />*Cleansing Balm (Glow Recipe): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3mtk8do">https://bit.ly/3mtk8do</a><br />*Bubbling Cleanser (Alpyn Beauty): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/33Am1wj">https://bit.ly/33Am1wj</a> <br />*Manual Silicone Handheld Cleansing Brush: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/32DmAGo">https://amzn.to/32DmAGo</a><br />*Purple Round Silicone Cleansing Brush: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2ZLnHlp">https://bit.ly/2ZLnHlp</a><br />*Foreo Dupe Cleansing Brush: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3iHngzZ">https://bit.ly/3iHngzZ</a><br />*Spinning Round Cleansing Brush: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2ZK3Se5">https://bit.ly/2ZK3Se5</a><br />*Makeup Eraser Towel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3c6dpkC">https://bit.ly/3c6dpkC</a><br /><br />*Affiliate Link from Amazon and RewardStyle. <br /><br />FTC: not a sponsored video. <br /><br />â–·Follow Me Here:<br />I N S T A G R A M @Milabu.co <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/2p4eif">https://goo.gl/2p4eif</a><br />T W I T T E R @Milabu9 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1p9tpbx">http://bit.ly/1p9tpbx</a><br />F A C E B O O K @Milabu <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2P4M35H">http://bit.ly/2P4M35H</a><br /><br /><br />Thank you so much for spending time with me and watching this video! <br />XO, <br />Milabu<br /><br />Hi, and welcome to my channel!
