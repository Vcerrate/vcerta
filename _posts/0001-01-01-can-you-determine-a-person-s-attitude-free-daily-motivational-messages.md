You hire for attitude. You can always teach skills.” <br /><br />I personally love this quote but there were so many different opinions and it was very interesting for me to read them. Many of the comments I saw brought valid points either for or against this statement.<br /><br />What stuck with me was that many people thought that you couldn’t determine a person’s attitude in an interview. Allow me to give my perspective on it. <br /><br />If you are a person with great people skills and if you are mindful, you absolutely can and here is how. <br />A person’s attitude comes from the way he or she thinks and it can be observed in the person’s energy. <br /><br />Is this too abstract for you? Stay with me for a moment. I will give you an example.<br /><br />If you’re afraid of dogs, will a dog feel that? Of course, it will. The dog will feel your level of energy and detect it very fast. <br /><br />Here is another example:<br /><br />Have you ever shook someone’s hand and something felt off? A person could be super friendly to me, smile and say, “How are you, Karin?” but the person may think, “I don’t like her.” That’s the energy you feel when you pay attention but most people are so disconnected from themselves that they have a difficult time connecting to others by being more observant and in tune with what’s going on. <br /><br />There is more to it but explained in very simple words…. Attitude is the quality of your energy. How you stand, how you walk and how you interact with others. Effort is the quantity of this energy. If you look for it, I promise you will see it. <br /><br />This was my thought for today and I will see you next week again.<br /><br />Until then be happy, be healthy and be at your best. <br /><br /><br />🐦Follow Me:<br />LinkedIn ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karinlindner/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/karinlindner/</a><br />Instagram ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/sexymanufacturing/">https://instagram.com/sexymanufacturing/</a><br /><br />📕 Get my book &quot;How To Make Manufacturing Sexy&quot; <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.ca/Manufacturing-Mindset-Passion-Production-Executive-ebook/dp/B007Z4UJ7I">https://www.amazon.ca/Manufacturing-Mindset-Passion-Production-Executive-ebook/dp/B007Z4UJ7I</a><br /><br />📕 Get my book ¿Cómo podemos lograr que LA INDUSTRIA MANUFACTURERA sea Sexy?
