{% raw %}Whilst this Taming.io update is generally a huge troll thanks to April Fools, the update has actually given me one of the only rare opportunities to try out the No Food Allowed Challenge.<br /><br />The Golden Cookie upgrade is the path I use to do this. Using the Golden Cookie does not heal you, but instead does damage to you. While technically I am using food, it prompts me and challenges me NOT to use it for this very reason. <br /><br />I use this upgrade to properly do this challenge, as there is no way I would not be able to do it without accidentally healing or having 0 food. Since you obtain food from players, boss &amp; boss pets and animals in general, there was no conceivable way to do the challenge before. The Golden Cookie upgrade tree may not last, so this is my only chance to ever try it out. How many kills did I obtain?<br /><br />Second Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ243v3D7Q47dZFTPLKaiLQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ243v3D7Q47dZFTPLKaiLQ</a> <br /><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/NpkaWCK">https://discord.gg/NpkaWCK</a> <br /><br />Music from Epidemic Sound (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.epidemicsound.com)">http://www.epidemicsound.com)</a>{% endraw %}
