Be Here, Be Queer travels around the UK and dives into the world of small-town LGBT+ nightlife as it gets back on its feet post-Covid. It explores why queer venues are still so vital to small communities, and takes an upfront look at the impact - the good, the bad, and the ugly - mainstream exposure has had on queer culture, as told by the drag artists who helped create it. Meet venue owners, UK drag legends, Drag Race UK stars, and the kings and queens who perform every night in the bars and clubs of UK LGBT+ scenes.<br /><br />Be Here, Be Queer follows the Netflix UK I Like To Watch '21 tour, which stopped at small LGBT+ venues around the UK. The tour saw Drag Race UK stars host movie screenings and drag shows with local talent, all in a bid to kick-start venues hit hard by Covid.<br /><br />➡️SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/29kBByr">http://bit.ly/29kBByr</a><br /><br />About Netflix:<br />Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with 214 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages.
