{% raw %}Welcome back to my channel.<br /><br />This week I’m working through my favourite suppleness exercises with my horse Corporal. He often gets commented in dressage tests for lacking suppleness. Especially in 10m circles, key yield and half pass. So I’m always working towards helping him become more flexible and supple through his body. <br />Great for dressage, showjumping and eventing horses. <br /><br />Disclaimer- please remember that this video is my own opinions on riding and training. Not all exercises will suit all horses and riders. Please adjust exercises to suit you and your horses ability.  <br /><br />Music - Epidemic Sounds <br /><br />If you would like to get in touch, please contact me at ejmequestrian@outlook.com<br /><br />Thank you<br />#Equestrian #Horses #Dressage{% endraw %}
