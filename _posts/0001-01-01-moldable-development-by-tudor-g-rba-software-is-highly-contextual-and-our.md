{% raw %}Software is highly contextual, and our tools should mold to allow us to embrace that context. In this talk we show how tools are essential, and in the process we reveal a novel way to approach programming as a whole. Among other things weâ€™ll learn that we can make more effective decisions about software by not reading code.<br /><br />The talk is exemplified by live demos of the Glamorous Toolkit (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://feenk.com/gt)">http://feenk.com/gt)</a> and the Moose analysis platform (moosetechnology.org).<br /><br />BIO: Tudor GÃ®rba (tudorgirba.com) is a software environmentalist and co-founder of feenk.com where he works with an amazing team on the Glamorous Toolkit, a novel IDE that reshapes the Development eXperience (feenk.com/gt). He leads the work on the Moose platform for software and data analysis (moosetechnology.org). He authored the humane assessment method to help teams solve real problems without reading code (humane-assessment.com). Tudor argues that storytelling should be prominent in software development (demodriven.com). In 2014, he won the prestigious Dahl-Nygaard Junior Prize for his work on the modeling and visualization of evolution and interplay of large numbers of objects (aito.org). Tudor holds a PhD from the University of Bern.<br /><br />â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”<br />ðŸŒ²FOLLOW US ðŸŒ²<br />â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”<br /><br />Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.10pines.com">https://blog.10pines.com</a><br />Web: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://10pines.com">https://10pines.com</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/10pines">https://twitter.com/10pines</a><br />FB: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/10pines">https://www.facebook.com/10pines</a><br /><br />#10Pines{% endraw %}
