{% raw %}These 6 mistakes are very common when people try to get ADU Permits and they're so easy to avoid upfront. Use these free tools to look up your property and make sure you don't get caught late in the process. You can look this up before you ever hire an architect or contractor or file for a permit. And for some of these, you'll be able to plan and design around the issue to save yourself money and avoid blowing up your Accessory Dwelling Unit budget.<br /><br />1. Fire Hazard Zones and wildland urban interface zones (WUIs) [pre-check what's allowed with the city/county]<br />2. Coastal Zone and Specific Plans [work with LCP before filing for permit]<br />3. Creek setbacks [pre-check what's allowed and design farther from creek]<br />4. Williamson Act [Check your county rules and maybe do something other than an ADU]<br />5. &quot;Front&quot; setbacks on corner lots and through lots [Don't build too close to &quot;side&quot; street on corner lot]<br />6.
