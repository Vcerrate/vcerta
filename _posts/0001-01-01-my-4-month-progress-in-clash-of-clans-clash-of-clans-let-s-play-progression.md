{% raw %}Clash of Clans Let's Play Progression Series After 4 Months! Judo Sloth Gaming provides tips and tricks whilst progressing through the CoC Account. The 1 Day, 1 Week and even 1 Month Episodes had very fast progression being the lower levels but things will slow down drastically. The idea of the series is to provide you with strategies for a variety of TH levels and package it in a new creative way that had not been done before. This would help to serve Clash of Clans Beginners as well as Advanced Players. I hope you continue to enjoy the series and as we progress to the higher Town Halls the episodes might have to be adjusted to continue bringing you learning from each episode.
