{% raw %}Welcome to Earth Relaxation !<br />The Nordic countries, also known as the Nordics or Norden, are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic. In short, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark are all Nordic countries with Scandinavian roots, but typically, you will only find Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish people referring to themselves as Scandinavian. Due to its northern location, there is almost no darkness in June and July in the north, reaching as far south as Trondheim. The Summers are light and the temperatures are mild. Above the Arctic Circle you can experience the Midnight Sun. Much of the Nordic countries are covered in snow during Winter; although snow is much rarer in the south and along the coast.<br />Music has so many benefits, and one of them is that it calms your nerves down. It's always a good idea to listen to some background music while you're doing something.
