{% raw %}Once Upon a Star by James Carter and Mar Hernández truly is a poetic journey through space. It serves as a great introduction to the space-hungry young minds. The book is printed on beautiful paper that has a vintage feel to it. Hernández's illustration for the book is rather unique, which makes it stand out from the normal children’s books genre. Not to mention the calming flow of words by the much loved poet James Carter! Highly recommend!<br /><br />Just a note that there is one more page to this book at the end where a more detailed &quot;Sciencey Stuff About the Sun&quot; is presented. I have not included this part of the book in the story reading.<br /><br />Learn more at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/30fFi5V">https://amzn.to/30fFi5V</a><br /><br />Special thanks to SiriusBeatTV for the amazing soundtrack to the story.
