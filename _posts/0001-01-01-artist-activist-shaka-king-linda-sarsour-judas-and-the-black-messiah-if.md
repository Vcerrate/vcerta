{% raw %}“If you took Fred Hampton out and you put some Black and brown organizers of 2021 today, you literally can replicate the entire film with images of movements today.” <br /><br />There’s so much to Fred Hampton’s story that we were never taught because it was considered too radical. Is it really so radical to ask for housing, food and healthcare? 50+ years later, the work led by the Black Panthers is as timely as ever. #JudasAndTheBlackMessiah director Shaka King and @untilfreedom cofounder @lsarsour discuss the ongoing work of activists today and why we must set straight the true legacy of Chairman Fred. <br /><br />Join the movement at LiveForThePeople.com{% endraw %}
