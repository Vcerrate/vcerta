{% raw %}Such a time of change and big decisions! What would you do? I can't quite keep up! I'm sharing some house hunting and James and I view a gorgeous, stone cottage this week. We also had some disasters so look out for those too! I'm having a creative slow down and continue with my early spring cleaning at home. Very therapeutic! I'm basically resetting everything; health, home and art studio. So much more is happening behind the scenes and I will share with you when I can over the coming weeks. Biggest loves &amp; softest hugs, thanks as always for keeping me company! Wendy.
