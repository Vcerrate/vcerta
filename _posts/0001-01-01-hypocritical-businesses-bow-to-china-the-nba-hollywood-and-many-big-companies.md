{% raw %}The NBA, Hollywood and many big companies make ads saying &quot;speak up on injustice.”  Yet they’re happy to ignore atrocities committed by China, because they want the money. <br />————<br />To make sure you see the new weekly video from Stossel TV, sign up here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.johnstossel.com/#subscribe">https://www.johnstossel.com/#subscribe</a><br />————<br />The NBA runs ads saying the league speaks for &quot;the people who may not be able to be heard.”<br /><br />It's “PR hogwash” says journalist Melissa Chen, because the NBA discourages its players from criticizing injustice in China.<br /><br />One general manager tweeted, “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.” <br /><br />That’s a good thing to say, since China is crushing freedom in Hong Kong. <br /><br />But the NBA apologized profusely, afraid that China might be offended. <br /><br />Hollywood grovels before China too. <br /><br />Actor John Cena innocently called Taiwan a country.<br /><br />China insists Taiwan is not a country, but a territory the Chinese own. <br /><br />Fearing his movie would be banned in China, Cena released a video begging China for forgiveness. <br /><br />Sadly, there are few examples of bravery. We highlight one important one.{% endraw %}
