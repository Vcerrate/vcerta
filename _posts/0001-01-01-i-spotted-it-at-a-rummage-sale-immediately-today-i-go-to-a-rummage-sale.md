{% raw %}Today I go to a rummage sale and stop in a Goodwill thrift store looking for things to flip on eBay and Amazon FBA to make money. I didn't know this rummage sale was even happening until last minute and it has turned out to be the best sale of they year! <br /><br />There are many places you can sell your garage sale and yard sale finds. Consider Etsy or Poshmark for clothing and even Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist for larger items like mowers or furniture. I like to sell some of my items on Mercari even, especially if eBay has too many sellers for that particular item.<br /><br />//MY RESELLING TOOLBOX<br /><br />Save on Bubble Wrap -<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.americanbubbleboy.com?sca_ref=1257069.PawLDS3PG3">https://www.americanbubbleboy.com?sca_ref=1257069.PawLDS3PG3</a><br /><br />Everything I Use For My Reselling Business -<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LalfeI">https://amzn.to/2LalfeI</a><br /><br />How I Cross List For More Income - <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://app.primelister.com/redirect/landing?r=WNJ-337">https://app.primelister.com/redirect/landing?r=WNJ-337</a><br /><br />//WHO AM I?<br /><br />I'm Wick and I am a reseller for a living.

I use the Amazon Seller App to scan for FBA.<br /><br />Q: Can you make a living selling online?<br /><br />A: Yes, the difficulty is based on how much effort you put in and how much you need to make each month. I do this full time.<br /><br />Q: Where do you find your clearance products to resell?<br /><br />A: Literally everywhere. Check end caps and look for clearance aisles, but mostly it will be mixed in. Ask a manager if there's any good clearance deals and build a relationship if possible.<br /><br />Q: Do you make a full-time living selling online?<br /><br />A: I do. All my bills are covered, I'm able to save a good amount, and put money back into the business. I also do other things to make money, but reselling is the meat. It takes a lot of work and dedication to make a full-time living reselling.<br /><br />Please like, comment, and subscribe! It keeps me motivated and happy.
