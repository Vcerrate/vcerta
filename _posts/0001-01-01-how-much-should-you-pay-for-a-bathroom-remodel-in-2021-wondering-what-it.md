{% raw %}Wondering what it would cost to do a bathroom remodel this year? A great tool we can use is called the costvsvalue.com report. This remodeling publication sends surveys out to contractors across the country asking them what they are currently charging for their services. Then, they calculate averages based off these answers, and break it down by regions in the United States. <br />The current average for our region is approximately $21,377.00. <br />This price point can fluctuate greatly depending on the size of your bathroom, the quality of materials used, and any structural changes made to the bathroom.<br />Designing your bathroom efficiently and choosing materials that are easy-to-maintain overtime, as well as choosing best-in-class warrantied products is the best way to get the most out of your budget. Our Design Consultants job is to help you achieve this goal.<br />Another way to make it easy on your wallet, is by focusing on one area of the bathroom first before completing the rest of your bathroom in a phased approach, as well as choosing a company with financing options where you can make small payments over time. <br /><br />To schedule a free Design Consultation, visit our website, showroom, or call us today! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rebath.com/location/lancaster/">https://www.rebath.com/location/lancaster/</a> <br />RE-BATH SHOWROOM IN LANCASTER, PA 1330 <br />Harrisburg Pike Lancaster, PA 17603<br /> 717-208-4586<br /><br />Sources: costvsvalue.com <br />Good Day PA!{% endraw %}
