{% raw %}10 Most Expensive Things Owned By The Rothschilds<br /><br />Being blamed for all the world's mishaps is one of the biggest downsides of having 500 million to 1 trillion dollars. Scratch that - that's the only downside, although I doubt anyone from the Rothschild family cares all that much what Ivan from Nish, Serbia, thinks of them. The wealthiest family in the world that generated hundreds if not thousands of conspiracy theories since as early as the 18th century has a much better way to spend their time - namely to make expensive purchases that will make them even wealthier over time. Today, we will take a look precisely at the Rothschilds' most profitable investments over the years.<br /><br />Thanks For Watching: 10 Most Expensive Things Owned By The Rothschilds<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:39 Planet 9 Yacht<br />1:28 Gunnersbury Park<br />2:32 Chateau Mouton Rothschild<br />3:37 Waddesdon Manor<br />5:01 Agora Oil &amp; Gas<br />5:58 Rothschild Art Collection<br />6:53 RIT Capital Partners<br />8:14 Rio Tinto Mining Corporation<br />8:56 La Compagnie Financiere<br />9:37 Glencore Mining<br /><br />Welcome to Luxury Zone, On this Channel we share everything about Luxury and help you experience the billionaire lifestyle.
