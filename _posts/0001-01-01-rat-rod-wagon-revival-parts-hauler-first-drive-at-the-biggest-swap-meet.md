In today's episode, we finish the parts hauler go kart trailer, take it for a test ride, and cruise around the swap meet. <br /><br />Thanks for Watching! <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/VR6mh2">https://goo.gl/VR6mh2</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/PqOIo3">https://goo.gl/PqOIo3</a><br /><br />Go Power Sports: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/c2Tz6o">https://goo.gl/c2Tz6o</a><br /><br />Get $100 off any Langmuir Systems Crossfire CNC plasma table using this link, or use code CARSANDCAMERAS at checkout: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://store.langmuirsystems.com/discount/CARSANDCAMERAS">http://store.langmuirsystems.com/discount/CARSANDCAMERAS</a><br /><br />Join the CarsandCameras Pit Crew: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU3gQGhk0lYK-fKOR0sopgg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU3gQGhk0lYK-fKOR0sopgg/join</a><br />Subscribe to our PODCAST channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpMj4EkYHrIxk1WH-bI4m4w">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpMj4EkYHrIxk1WH-bI4m4w</a><br />NEW MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.cars-cameras.com/">http://www.cars-cameras.com/</a><br />Equipment we use: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/carsandcameras">https://www.amazon.com/shop/carsandcameras</a><br /><br />The following video features activities performed in controlled environments by knowledgeable persons.
