{% raw %}A combo of fat-burning HIIT &amp; standing Ab movements. So we have both effects in a short time ♥︎ / Werbung <br /><br />I reaaaally really like this workout :D I’m super happy that I can „enjoy“ this myself from now on. It’s like a basic HIIT session, but with the BONUS of training your Abs. All standing, no yoga mat required. Ideal if you are on the go and don’t have anything with you! <br /><br />▸ ABS #1: I turned the „rests“ into slow, standing Core exercises. Ab Twists, Standing Crunches, etc.  <br />▸ ABS #2: I focused on HIIT movements, that involve more Core engagement as well. Plank Jumps with added Crunches, etc. <br />▸ HIIT: This will get your heart rate up, burn calories, burn fat, increase your metabolism &amp; tone your muscles at the same time :) <br /><br />And don’t hate me for the end. Half Burpees… sorry not sorry. It’s hard - but it’s the end, so you got no choice haha! <br /><br />__<br /><br />Depending on your fitness level, height and weight you will burn between 70-110 kcal. <br />I burned about 70kcal in those 10min (remember, I'm a small human and my body is already adapted to plank jumps and jump squats haha).<br /><br />If you struggle or need a break: don't worry about it. Take a small rest, get something to drink &amp; continue once you're ready :) most important is that you don't quit and push yourself. <br /><br />__<br /><br />➞ my Pam App ♥︎ Free workout &amp; meal plans (11 versions, different fitness levels), lot of recipes &amp; tips: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pam-app.de/app">https://www.pam-app.de/app</a><br /><br />▸ 2 of those FREE WORKOUT PLANS are on my Instagram Channel. <br />Lose Weight &amp; Focus on a Bubble Butt.
