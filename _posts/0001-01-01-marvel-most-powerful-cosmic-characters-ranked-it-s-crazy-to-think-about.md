{% raw %}It’s crazy to think about just how big the cosmic side of Marvel comics can be. We may think Earth is a huge place filled with powerful people, but our home planet is just a tiny speck in the grand scheme of things. Over the years, Marvel Comics has introduced a massive amount of cosmic characters and entities who all seem to be more powerful than the last. But with the cosmos being so big, just who is the most powerful cosmic character of all time? <br /><br />There are a lot out there! And that’s what today’s list is for. I’ll be discussing some of the lower level cosmic characters like Knull, Hulking and Adam Warlock to highlight just what the cosmic side of Marvel comics can offer for later in the MCU, as well as move onto some all-powerful forces like the Phoenix Force, the Infinites, The Celestials and the Embodiments of the Universe. That’s a lot to keep track of! And of course, I have to mention everyone’s favorite giant purple planet-eater Galactus and not only explaining just how powerful he can be, but also how he’ll fit in the MCU very soon!<br /><br />So join me today as I break down all the powerful cosmic characters Marvel has to offer.
