{% raw %}During Lent in a Message  in 2013 Our Lady Said Our Lady says: &quot;Do not shut your eyes to the warnings which the Heavenly Father sends to you out of love. &quot; <br />Do you love Him above all else? <br /> Do you repent for having often forgotten that the Heavenly Father, out of His great love, sent His Son to redeem us by the Cross? <br />Do you repent for not having accepted the message? <br /><br />Do not let the Devil rule your eyes.<br /><br /><br />Our Lady persistently asks us to look at our brothers and sisters and see Jesus and holiness in them but at times she also warns us that the devil wants your eyes for himself. <br /><br />In an apparition with Mirjana on September 2, 2008 She Said: Dear Children, <br /><br />Look in the eyes of your brother and see Jesus, my Son. If you see joy, rejoice with him. If there is pain in the eyes of your brother, with your tenderness and goodness, cast it away, because without love you are lost. Only love is effective; it works miracles. Love will give you unity in my Son and the victory of my heart. Therefore, my children, love. ”<br /><br /><br /><br />On November 2, 2006 in Our Lady specifically revealed that  our eyes are often ruled by delusions which are of the devil. She said: <br />“Dear children, My coming to you, my children, is God's love. God is sending me to warn you and to show you the right way. Do not shut your eyes before the truth, my children. Your time is a short time. Do not permit delusions to begin to rule over you.  The way on which I desire to lead you is the way of peace and love.<br /><br />Then on  March 2, 2013 Our Lady  she powerfully warns that if you shut your eyes to  God then they open up to Satan’s rule.{% endraw %}
