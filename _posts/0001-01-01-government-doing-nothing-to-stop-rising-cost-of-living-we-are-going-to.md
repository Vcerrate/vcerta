{% raw %}We are going to see an enormous increase in the cost of living in 2022, larger than in 2021 if it goes as expected. The Conservative government try to say that there is little they can do, but other countries are applying measures to keep costs down. France have levied energy companies to keep their energy bills down to a 4% increase, the UK is doing nothing and our bills are going up by 54%. And the cost of all imports will be rising above the level of other countries due to brexit, another Conservative policy. The party only exists to take money from the poor and give it to the rich.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias">https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76">https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76</a>{% endraw %}
