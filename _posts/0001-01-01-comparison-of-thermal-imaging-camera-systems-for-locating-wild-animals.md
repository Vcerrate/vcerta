{% raw %}During the breeding season (1. April to 15. July) a large number of animals die because of the mowing. The young wild animals like fawn and the young rabbit and also the eggs of many ground breeders are affected. In the first days after birth the instinct reaction of the wild animals is not to flee, they look for protection in the high grass. That means the certain death for the young animals while the spring mowing.<br /><br />The search for young animals by drone with thermography should be done in the early hours or in the late evening. In these time periods the temperature difference between the young animals and the environment is very high. With the rising sun, the temperature difference between animal and environment is getting lower, so the detectability decreases.<br /><br />But not only the temperature difference between the young and the environment is a crucial factor for detecting wildlife, but also the performance of the thermal imaging camera systems.<br /><br /><br />WEBSITE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://syswe.de/en">http://syswe.de/en</a><br /><br /><br />SOCIAL NETWORK:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/SYSWE-Systemtechn...">http://facebook.com/SYSWE-Systemtechn...</a>{% endraw %}
