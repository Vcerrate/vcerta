{% raw %}Hi All,<br /><br />I rather enjoyed my session last time out, managing to assemble a bumper collection of games for a single video.  The end result was - in the circumstances - a slight disappointment, I made a profit, but a fairly modest one when considering the potential of the games I had banked.<br /><br />I've said many times though, there is absolutely no predicting these games.  I manage to prove myself wrong pretty much every time I try, so it really is just a case of sitting back and enjoying the ride.  The big wins are rare but do happen, the dismal bonuses all too common!  Ultimately, if I can manage an evenings entertainment without breaking the bank that is good enough for me.<br /><br />At the start of this video I am a quite ridiculous amount ahead from my most recent deposits here.  Something in the order of £1800, and that is from playing in and around the 60p stake mark.  A few huge bonuses has made all the difference, and that is the appeal for me.  They can, and do come along, albeit infrequently.<br /><br />I have played a lot of Blackjack down the years and note the similarities in that respect.  It makes more sense with Blackjack that you can go on a run of fortune good or bad, but the same thing really does seem to happen with the slots.  I guess stringing together a few big wins will often equal a good spell though, whereas without them you are slowly but surely eroded away.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a rather lengthy way of trying to explain the current situation, in addition to my expectation that luck is surely due to change.  I will be expecting it imminently, whilst hoping for the best.  Today I have 9 bonuses for a very reasonable cost of £376, every chance of break even I feel, certainly with this selection:<br /><br />Empty the Bank<br />Mayan Gods<br />Great Rhino<br />Great Rhino MW<br />Star Clusters<br />Kingmaker<br />Spartacus MW<br />Mars Attacks<br />King of Cats (Lion)<br /><br />Of course, on a bad day, this lot is certainly capable of paying next to nothing.  I hope you enjoy this one, I will be back soon.<br /><br />#onlineslots #slots #bonushunt{% endraw %}
