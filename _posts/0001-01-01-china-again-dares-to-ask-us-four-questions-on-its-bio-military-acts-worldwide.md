{% raw %}China Daily: Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the accusation of Russia’s use of chemical weapons is unfounded and the goal is to divert the international community’s attention from the biological laboratories discovered in Ukraine. Does China have any comment?<br /><br />Zhao Lijian: I have noted the remarks. Indeed, the US has not yet given any convincing explanation for its bio-military activities. Undertaking consultation and cooperation to address concerns is a requirement of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The US has no right to reject discussions on the issue. <br /><br />The US remarks have so far been ambiguous and even self-contradictory, which aroused greater suspicion from the international community. People are asking: How many cooperation facilities is the US running across the world? How many biological samples did the US ship out of Ukraine according to bilateral agreement with the country and for what purpose? What is the sensitive information that Ukraine is not allowed to make public according to the agreement? Did the US conduct dangerous researches overseas that are prohibited in the US?<br /><br />Moreover, although the US talked about the need to strengthen and revitalize the Convention mechanism when commemorating the 50th anniversary of the BWC’s opening for signature as a depository state, it continued to ignore the appeal of the international community at the BWC PrepCom that concluded earlier this week. Why does the US stand alone in opposing the resumption of multilateral negotiations aimed at establishing a BWC verification mechanism? How can the US win the trust of the international community with such behavior? How can it restore the international community’s confidence in the US compliance?<br /><br />As one of the BWC depository states, the US ought to be an example, not an exception, when it comes to compliance. We once again urge the US to give comprehensive and detailed clarification of its bio-military activities and stop single-handedly opposing the establishment of a multilateral verification mechanism.<br /><br />Editor: Zhu Yan<br /><br />__________________<br />Powered by Shanghai Media Group, ShanghaiEye focuses on producing top-quality content for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube.<br />Nobody knows Shanghai better than us.<br />Please subscribe to us  ☻☻☻<br />__________________<br />For more stories, please click <br />■ What's up today in Shanghai, the most updated news of the city<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MNjpE4hspSVry8dR555getN">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MNjpE4hspSVry8dR555getN</a><br />■ Amazing Shanghai, exploring the unknown corners of the city,  learning the people, food and stories behind them<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MMVTWr-zIXjsS4hhSQPmyes">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MMVTWr-zIXjsS4hhSQPmyes</a><br />■ What Chinese people's lives are like during the post COVID-19 period<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MPrPTmIirpfgETu6VKVESXe">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MPrPTmIirpfgETu6VKVESXe</a><br />■ Views of foreign scholars on China and its affairs<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MO9ua_nSK6slRPdUl-ovjRe">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MO9ua_nSK6slRPdUl-ovjRe</a><br />■ Foreign faces in Shanghai, people living in this city sharing their true feelings<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MP0vJDSw23_1MCPJhAfGbiG">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MP0vJDSw23_1MCPJhAfGbiG</a><br />■ Mini-docs showing why China is the country it is today <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MOreRu2AbZ3ziIUyCcdBLwX">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MOreRu2AbZ3ziIUyCcdBLwX</a><br />__________________<br />☎Leave us messages if you have any suggestions or questions!<br />Thank you!{% endraw %}
