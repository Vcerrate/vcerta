{% raw %}Studies have shown that chronic inflammation in the body can lead to some serious health issues – and it can happen just by eating. So we joined Chef Kelly Boyer, anti-inflammatory foods expert and chef, to learn about how what you eat affects inflammation. Get the full recipes here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2CTTFQO">https://bit.ly/2CTTFQO</a><br /><br />First, let’s find out some of the food culprits that causing inflammation. “There are a couple broad categories,” shares Kelly. “Dairy is one of them; refined sugar for sure; gluten, and really any kind of processed foods.” But luckily there’s good foods, too!<br /><br />1. Turmeric <br /><br />First on our list of anti-inflammatory foods is Turmeric! “It is one of the most powerful immune boosting seasonings out there,” says Kelly. So just how much turmeric should you add to your diet? Kelly says you want to consume about 10 milligrams per day. Get your fill with Chef Kelly’s  roasted cauliflower with turmeric tahini dish, which incorporates dates, dill, mint, and chopped pistachios. <br /><br />2. Peppers<br /><br />You can have plenty of our next food – peppers, which contain anti-oxidants that have powerful anti-inflammatory effects. “They're so good for you,” says Kelly. “They contain a lot of omega-6s [and] vitamin C. This is a beautiful, perfect food.” Add peppers to your diet with Chef Kelly’s pepperonata with tri-colored bell peppers and a fried egg. “Everything you see right here is all beautiful and fresh, and is absolutely good for you,” she insists. Peppers are one of those anti-inflammatory foods that taste as good as they are healthy for you!<br /><br />3. Coffee<br /><br />Finally – coffee makes our roundup of anti-inflammatory foods? Yes, and you can enjoy it either brewed or even ground and in granola. “It contains polyphenols, which is a micro-nutrient that mitigates inflammation,” reveals Kelly. “This is one of my favorites because it's an anti-inflammatory bomb.” Get more coffee into your body with Kelly’s coffee cacao granola. Make it using coffee grounds of any kind. Kelly recommends having a treat like this granola a couple times a week. And if you're a coffee drinker, good news! Kelly says you should drink coffee every day to reap all the benefits.<br /><br />If you’re looking for foods that reduce inflammation, now you’ve got three anti-inflammatory foods and recipes to try at home!<br /><br />THE LIST is the national Emmy award winning show where pop culture takes a need-to-know twist.
