{% raw %}The digestive system is the system that helps us break down the food we eat to its basic nutrients so that our body can use those nutrients to get energy. The digestive system is composed of the long continuous alimentary tract or gastrointestinal tract (or simply gut) and accessory organs like the pancreas, liver, gallbladder. Our digestive system also receives help from gut bacteria that reside in the intestines.<br />But that's just the surface of the digestive system. New research shows that our guts affect our body in surprising ways. Our gut communicates with the nervous system and might affect our moods and mental health. The gut bacteria help the immune system fight of deadly pathogens! Our digestive tract is more complex than first appears.<br /><br />References:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/digestive-system/expert-answers/faq-20058340#:~:text=After%20you%20eat%2C%20it%20takes,move%20through%20the%20entire%20colon">https://www.mayoclinic.org/digestive-system/expert-answers/faq-20058340#:~:text=After%20you%20eat%2C%20it%20takes,move%20through%20the%20entire%20colon</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.7601">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.7601</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001424">https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001424</a><br /><br /><br />#science #animation #digestivesystem<br /><br /><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Follow us on Twitter! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/abc_science">https://twitter.com/abc_science</a><br /><br />Follow us on Facebook!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/sciabc">https://facebook.com/sciabc</a><br /><br />Follow our Website!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scienceabc.com">https://www.scienceabc.com</a>{% endraw %}
