{% raw %}This video will show how to use your ESP32 to 1) create an access point for client connection, 2) serve a web page using HTML, 3) make fast updates of changed data on the page using AJAX and XML, and 4) receive user interactions like button presses, slider settings, from the web page. <br /><br />This video is fairly detailed and long, but hopefully with the included sample code, you will be able to create fancy web pages that let you update data quickly and allow users to makes setting changes from the web page.<br /><br />Use this technique for home automation systems, control systems, remote monitoring systems, telemetry etc. Send and get data from your web page made easy.<br /><br />This tutorial uses a standard ESP32 mico-controller and the Arduino IDE. The web page is written HTML, uses CSS styling to make the web page look better, and java script to update portions of the web page from XML sent from the ESP.<br /><br />code at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/KrisKasprzak/ESP32_WebPage">https://github.com/KrisKasprzak/ESP32_WebPage</a>{% endraw %}
