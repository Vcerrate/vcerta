{% raw %}The knighthood for twice sacked cabinet minister, Gavin Williamson looks very corrupt. The timing of it is also highly curious. It was thought that Williamson was knighted for allowing Boris Johnson to sack him without a fuss. It is now supposed that what Williamson knows could be very damaging for Johnson in terms of his links to Putin's agents. Combined with the cuts to funding for investigating Russian interference, it looks like Johnson is trying to hide those links with Putin.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias">https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76">https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76</a><br />Cadwalladr thread: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/carolecadwalla/status/1499482812889681921">https://twitter.com/carolecadwalla/status/1499482812889681921</a>{% endraw %}
