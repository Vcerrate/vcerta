{% raw %}We all going though challenging times and it's different for everyone, but the individual feelings of it is often mutual.  In this video I resist holding the camera as I struggle to recognize the need to just be with my own feelings and allow myself the space to be with them.  I honestly didn't even think I had enough footage to make a video, but then I found a song that pretty much filled in the gap I was looking for.  On a lighter note, I share some exciting &amp; encouraging news as I close the video.<br /><br />Side note:<br />I've been pretty self observant these days, with a growing curiosity of my own physical, emotional and mental health.  I've been thinking about sharing more of that kind of thing with the channel as well as more of the typical &quot;Sharing The Wild&quot; content, of course.  I want to share more videos as well, and this will come around as I near the end of my work on Nick's van. In the mean time I want to thank all of you for pressing play and making this whole journey possible. I just reached 30k Subs which is so amazing and I'm so thrilled by the journey this channel has brought for me and all of you. I want to wish &quot;Onwards &amp; Upwards&quot; to all of you from the depths of my heart and if you're working though some stuff, just take it one breath at a time and be fair to yourself as you move through it.<br /><br />Much Love<br /><br />Joseph<br /><br />Special Guests:<br />@Mark the Paint Guy <br /><br />Support the channel and me:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sharingthewild">https://www.patreon.com/sharingthewild</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/1318YHZFFYL3V?ref_=wl_share">https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/1318YHZFFYL3V?ref_=wl_share</a><br /><br />Work with me:<br />info@sharingthewild.ca<br /><br />All the music in my videos is sourced from Epidemic Sound:<br />Referral link <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/9ld428/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/9ld428/</a><br /><br />A bit about me:<br /><br />My name is Joseph &amp; I'm based out of British Columbia Canada. I’ve been living full time in my Minivan since 2019.  Choosing this lifestyle was out of necessity and an adaptation to my life’s circumstances.  It followed a separation and housing cost’s had inflated beyond what I could afford in balance to my other needs and responsibilities. This lifestyle also presented an opportunity to refocus on the parts of my life that mattered more and it affords me more resources to share with my family.  I’ve worked in retail, aviation, forestry, yoga, and other health and wellness services.  Now day’s I’m more of a freelancer however I'm still involved part time with the yoga industry and of course sharing videos on YouTube. <br /><br />Some of my most fundamental values and visions are built around conservation, education, compassion, humility, and exploration.  <br /><br />I love to get out into nature to explore wild places and often bring back wild food and medicines. I love foraging for plants &amp; mushrooms, and of course hunting &amp; fishing. I’m also keenly interested in self development, coaching and counselling, cooking and process foods, problem solving, exploring, building, learning, healing, teaching, and most of all, being a Dad.  My goal here, is to share and build the journey with all of you and hopefully foster inspiration and elicit a positive change in the world.<br /><br />The world is my playground, my school, my mother and certainly not mine.<br /><br />Gratitude and much love<br /><br />Joseph<br /><br />Chapters:<br />00:00 Intro<br />01:30 The bright side of Van Life<br />04:53 Hitting the road &amp; boat in the pursuit of fish with my buddy Mark<br />07:46 Arriving at the lake &amp; catching a little brook trout<br />10:05 Feeling the blues &amp; sharing it with this song that says it all<br />14:20 Sharing a milestone update on my girl<br />15:36 Sharing some self observation and a positive celebration{% endraw %}
