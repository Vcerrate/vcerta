/>attracting into your life,<br />then it's very important<br />to understand the reason<br />because until you understand the reason<br />you are attracting narcissists,<br />what ends up happening is<br />you keep attracting them<br />into your life.<br />You keep them in that energy dynamic,<br />you find your self changing the faces<br />but the energy remains the same.<br />And in this video,<br />I'm gonna show you how to<br />finally break the cycle,<br />show you why that actually is happening,<br />and how this will absolutely<br />transform your life.<br />If there's one simple<br />statement I could say<br />that explains this dynamic,<br />it is that of obviously the<br />empath being attracted to,<br />or attracting into their<br />life, the narcissist.<br />Now an empath is somebody<br />that is very sensitive<br />to other people's emotions,<br />is someone that can feel what other people<br />are thinking and feeling,<br />and its somebody that in general,<br />is considered a a highly<br />sensitive person, normally.<br />Then on the other side of<br />that, we have a narcissist.<br />The narcissist is somebody<br />that lacks empathy,<br />somebody that is normally<br />using and manipulating<br />other people to get their needs met.<br />And what ends up happening,<br />is we have two sides of this coin.<br />Now I'm somebody that's had<br />personal experience with this,<br />because I've always felt<br />like an empath growing up.<br />My ex-stepmom growing up was a,<br />and is still to this day,<br />a hardcore narcissist.<br />Growing up, it was something<br />where my brother and I<br />had no freedom, we had to sneak<br />the other side of the house<br />just to get enough food to eat,<br />we had to earn going to school activities.<br />And we grew up not<br />allowed to have friends,<br />not allowed to watch TV.<br />We had a very interesting childhood,<br />kind of like having an<br />army sergeant as a parent,<br />that was my ex-stepmom.<br />And my dad was with her<br />until I was 15 years old.<br />Then what happened is,<br />my dad broke up with her,<br />we had all this freedom all of a sudden.<br />And in a weird way, it felt kind of scary<br />to have all that freedom.<br />Now after 15, I did end up<br />eventually getting a job<br />at Nordstrom in women's shoes.<br />And it was like every single,<br />even though my ex-stepmom<br />left my life, the narcissist,<br />to be in their own frame.<br />Empaths can learn how to<br />be grounded and centered<br />and leading in their life,<br />able to set boundaries.<br />What do narcissist need to learn?<br />Narcissists need to learn that of empathy.<br />Need to learn how to be more considerate<br />to other people's thoughts,<br />needs, and feelings.<br />So, what you could see here is that<br />narcissists and empaths attract each other<br />because they actually<br />have something to learn<br />from each other.<br />It is like peanut butter and jelly way,<br />don't taste as good, but<br />you know, the idea is,<br />that this dynamic attracts each other<br />because there's something to learn<br />from the expression of each energy.<br />And what the narcissist represses<br />is empathy and compassion,<br />and thought, thinking about others.<br />And what the empath represses<br />is that of being in<br />their own frame, leading,<br />being assertive.<br />So, this was a game changer for me<br />because I made the<br />transition and the shift<br />into being the empath,<br />into being more balanced.<br />Now, both of these by the way,<br />are kind of the imbalanced<br />ways of going about it,<br />there's a happy medium in<br />the middle, that is healthy.<br />Narcissists are the extreme<br />of the manipulation,<br />and this side of the coin,<br />and then empaths are the other side,<br />is sometimes where a<br />lot of empaths feel like<br />they lose their sense of self.<br />It's hard to set boundaries,<br />they feel guilty,<br />and it's almost like your<br />emotions are my emotions.<br />So if I disappoint you,<br />I'm disappointing myself,<br />because you are me.<br />There's an identification.<br />And by the way my shadow<br />work coach explains it too,<br />this'll also maybe transform the whole way<br />of looking at this dynamic.{% endraw
