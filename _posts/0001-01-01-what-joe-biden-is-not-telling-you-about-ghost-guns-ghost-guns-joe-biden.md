{% raw %}Ghost Guns Joe Biden<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://uscca.com/colionnoir">https://uscca.com/colionnoir</a><br /><br />A so-called ghost gun is nothing more than a gun someone built themselves. That's all a ghost gun is. They love calling it a ghost gun because homemade guns don't scare suburban housewives with helicopter mom syndrome like, &quot;GHOST GUN.&quot; <br /><br />Joe Biden was having trouble getting his so-called &quot;Ghost Guns&quot; passed in Congress because building your own gun for personal use has always been legal. Hell, it says it right on the ATF website;<br /><br />&quot;No, a license is not required to make a firearm solely for personal use. However, a license is required to manufacture firearms for sale or distribution. The law prohibits a person from assembling a non–sporting semiautomatic rifle or shotgun from 10 or more imported parts, as well as firearms that cannot be detected by metal detectors or x-ray machines. In addition, the making of an NFA firearm requires a tax payment and advance approval by ATF.&quot;<br /><br />What Biden wants to do is make it so you can no longer build your own gun for personal use, but as I pointed out, the ability to build your own gun has always been legal, so to change that, Congress has to make it illegal, he can't just decide to do it himself.<br /><br />These kits are not as plug and play as Joe is making them out to be; you actually have to engage in gun-smithing to have a functioning gun. But the law doesn't say that you can only build your own gun if it is hard to do.<br /><br />Biden is not telling you that most guns used in crimes are untraceable because there's this thing called the black market where criminals get their guns.<br /><br />You can have 19 serial numbers on a gun, and it still won't tell you anything other than where the gun was first sold.<br /><br />Joe Biden loves misquoting stats. The actual stat is that the Justice Department statistics show that nearly 24,00 ghost guns were recovered by law enforcement at crime scenes and reported to the government from 2016 to 2020. Not 24,000 in 2020. <br /><br />We don't need the government's permission to make our own guns because the Second Amendment wasn't telling us what we can and can't do; it was written to tell the government what they can't do. <br /><br />For Concealed Carry Insurance mentioned in the video click here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mrcolionnoir.com/go/uscca/">https://www.mrcolionnoir.com/go/uscca/</a> <br /><br />IYKYK The Second Amendment Merchandise<br />➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3l0EhYZ">https://bit.ly/3l0EhYZ</a><br /><br />Let's Go Brandon Merchandise<br />➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3EbcXP8">https://bit.ly/3EbcXP8</a> <br /><br />If I Only Had One Concealed Carry - FREE Book<br />➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mrcolionnoir.com/start-here/">https://www.mrcolionnoir.com/start-here/</a><br /><br />To Order Your PRO 2A Hats Click Here: <br />➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.mrcolionnoir.com/collections/hats">https://shop.mrcolionnoir.com/collections/hats</a><br /><br />Help US Further our Pro Constitution, Pro 2A message:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.MrColionNoir.com/donate/">https://www.MrColionNoir.com/donate/</a><br /><br />FOLLOW ME ON:<br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mrcolionnoir">https://twitter.com/mrcolionnoir</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/colionnoir/">https://www.instagram.com/colionnoir/</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/COLIONNOIR/">https://www.facebook.com/COLIONNOIR/</a><br /><br />#DefensiveGunUse #ColionNoir{% endraw %}
