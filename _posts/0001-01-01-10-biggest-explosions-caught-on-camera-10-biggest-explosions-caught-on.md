Regardless of the circumstances surrounding it, it results in loss of life and property. Here are the ten biggest explosions caught on camera!<br />10. Chernobyl<br />In 1986, a nuclear reactor exploded at Chernobyl in Ukraine, which was still part of the Soviet Union. The blast blew off a 2000-ton lid off the reactor and sent out 400 times more radioactive fallout than the Hiroshima bomb, thereby contaminating more than 77,000 square miles of Europe. About 600,000 people were exposed to high doses of radiation, and more than 350,000 people were evacuated from infected areas.<br />The accident killed 30 operators and firefighters within three months, and several other people died later. Two hundred thirty-seven people were diagnosed with acute radiation syndrome, of which some of them died within a few weeks. The disaster was a unique one and the only accident in the history of commercial nuclear power where radiation-related fatalities occurred. The Chernobyl blast contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union. More than 30 years on, scientists estimate that the zone around the plant would be inhabitable for up to 20,000 years.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8kwBAc_FrA&amp;t=31s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8kwBAc_FrA&amp;t=31s</a><br />9. Trinity Blast<br />The first atomic bomb in history detonated in 1945 and was dubbed &quot;the gadget.&quot; It exploded at a force of 20 kilotons of TNT. While watching the test, J. Robert, a scientist, said that all he could think of was the line in the Hindu scripture that talked about death. Nuclear weapons were later used to end World War II and ushered in decades of annihilation and fear. Later, some civilians in New Mexico might have been exposed a thousand times to public radiation far beyond the recommended limit.<br />A special tour of the site was conducted in 1995 to mark the 50th anniversary of the Trinity test. More than 5000 visitors were at the venue to commemorate the occasion. The area averages two to three thousand visitors yearly and remains a popular destination for people interested in atomic tourism. It is open to the public twice yearly, and the residual radiation at the site is ten times higher than average background radiation.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiWb5yV4MqM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiWb5yV4MqM</a><br />8. China warehouse explosion<br />Two explosions in the port of Tianjin, northern China, left more than a hundred people dead and more hundreds injured. The blast happened in a warehouse containing flammable and hazardous chemicals like ammonium nitrate, sodium cyanide potassium nitrate, and sodium nitrate. An official of the Tianjin Dongjiang Port Ruihai International logistics was arrested after the blast. There were suggestions that the water sprayed on the chemicals may have triggered the explosion. Calcium carbide, for example, reacts with water to create highly explosive acetylene.<br />The China Earthquake Networks Center said the first explosion had a power equivalent to three tonnes of TNT detonating while the second one was 21 tonnes. The second was so big that the satellites orbiting Earth picked it up too. The explosion destroyed most of the goods stored in the port, and large shipping containers were tossed in the air like matchsticks. Over 4,000 cars around the site were lost, and residential areas spanning several kilometers were not spared.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2Y-rk_nqDA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2Y-rk_nqDA</a><br />7. Underwater nuke test<br />On July 26, 1946, the U.S military experimented with a new type of nuclear test. In charge, the task force suspended an atomic device 90 feet below the water's surface in one of the isolated rings of coral and land that make up the Marshall Islands. The military leaders who proposed the test wanted to prove that their ship could ride out a nuclear attack and that the fleet was obsolete. Nuclear scientists questioned the point of the test as it turned out to be more controversial than expected.<br /><br />When the nuclear device exploded, it created a giant underwater bubble of hot gas. Seconds later, the bubble hit the seafloor and blasted a crater 30 feet deep and 1800 feet wide. The lagoon surface erupted into a giant water column shot more than 5000 feet into the air. LSM-60 and Arkansas, a battleship, were among the first ships to be sunk by an atomic bomb. Many other ships were not spared as radiation levels became dangerously high. The nuclear test slated for the same year was postponed after the aftermath of the first one. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYbVQY0cBWk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYbVQY0cBWk</a><br />6. Carbide Pesticide plant in Bhopal<br />An explosion at the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal on December 3, 1984, has to be one of the worst disasters in history.{% endraw %}
