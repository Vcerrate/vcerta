{% raw %}During this two-days walking adventure in Belgrade, we passed 36,000 steps, 21 km and enjoyed in spirit of capital city of Serbia, people, buildings and atmosphere. That will be not an option if we used a car. In this video you are watching first part of fist day.<br /><br />One kilometer long Knez Mihailo‚Äôs Street, named after Mihailo Obrenoviƒá III, Princ of Serbia, is the main pedestrian and shopping zone in Belgrade. It is one of the oldest and most valuable landmarks of the city, protected by the law, with buildings and maisons built during the late 1870s.<br /><br />For more information you may visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knez_Mihailova_Street">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knez_Mihailova_Street</a><br /><br />MIHAILO OBRENOVIƒÜ III was the son of Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá and his wife Ljubica Vukomanoviƒá. This Serbian ruler often, with self-sacrifice, managed to build numerous cultural institutions, such as the National Theater, and to help individuals who contributed to the cultural development of Serbia. He was ready to pledge his property for the preparation of the liberation war against Turkey. Thanks to him, the Serbian army was formed, which during his rule began to gain importance and role in political life. He was also the first in modern Serbian history to declare Belgrade the capital city of the country. His greatest wish was the liberation and unification of the Serbian people. During his rule, the first moder Serbian coins were minted. He is the first Serbian ruler to whom the people erected a monument, which still adorns the center of Belgrade.<br /><br />The LIBRARY OF THE CITY OF BELGRADE was founded in 1931, and in the same year the first public children's library in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was opened. It is located in Knez Mihailova Street, number 56, in the building of the former hotel Srpska kruna. The hotel was built around 1867 as the most modern, most representative and best equipped hotel in Belgrade at that time. It was most likely built by the family of wealthy merchants Krsmanoviƒá. Nowdays the library is the largest public lending library in the country.<br /><br />MILAN RAKIƒÜ was a Serbian poet-diplomat and a member of the Serbian Royal Academy (1934).<br /><br />RAJIƒÜEVA SHOPPING CENTER is located in the heart of the city on 15,300 square meters of space designed for enjoyment and shopping in the most beautiful part of the city, in more than 80 stores with one or more renowned brands and numerous restaurants.<br /><br />The MUSEUM OF LEGACIES was founded in 2004 by the Assembly of the City of Belgrade as a result of a decades-long initiative of artists, intellectuals, experts and donors. As an institution, the House of Legacies is dedicated to stimulating and restoring the donation institution. Another important goal of its establishment is the reception of new legacies and gifts.<br /><br />ZEPTER MUSEUM was founded with the aim of systematically collecting, protecting, preserving, studying, exhibiting and publishing works of art. The idea is to find works and artists who can paint a picture of the complex art scene in Serbia in the second half of the 20th century and the beginning of the new millennium.<br /><br />The main activity of the GALLERY OF THE SERBIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AND ARTS is organizing exhibitions in the field of art, science and culture, publishing publications, organizing lectures related to exhibitions; collecting and storing objects in the field of fine arts, which are owned by the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts; formation of documentation on the activities of the Gallery and artists - academics; as well as concert - music activities.<br /><br />If you would like to enjoy in old Belgrade and Kalemegdan walk:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/lHSVbwK4r9g">https://youtu.be/lHSVbwK4r9g</a><br /><br />We visited Beo ZOO as well:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/5jl8qpvj8hA">https://youtu.be/5jl8qpvj8hA</a><br /><br />The room tour of a hotel where we overnight in Belgrade:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SAHCvL_O1qs">https://youtu.be/SAHCvL_O1qs</a><br /><br />All above description and filmed material are only our expressions and personal experience for fun purposes only.
