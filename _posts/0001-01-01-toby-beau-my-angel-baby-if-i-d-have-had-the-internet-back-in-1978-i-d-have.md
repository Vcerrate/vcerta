{% raw %}If i'd have had the internet back in 1978, i'd have known that Toby Beau was a group not a bloke called Toby! The Texas band hit the big time with 'My Angel Baby' a mid tempo pop ballad which topped the Adult Contemp charts and scaled the Top 20 on Billboard's Top 100 reaching #13. They released three albums all up, but no further significant success occurred. <br /><br />'My angel baby' has a strong vocal performance; really fine harmonies and a catchy hook. The track was not a big hit in Australia, where it could only reach #63, but again thanks to American Top 40 it entered my consciousness, and I'm glad I collected an mp3 to be able to revisit this memorable pop song. Enjoy!{% endraw %}
