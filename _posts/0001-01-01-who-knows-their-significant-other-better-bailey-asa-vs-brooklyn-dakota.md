Let's see who really knows their significant other better! This was such a fun video to film, and we hope you enjoy it, too!!! <br /><br />✅ Also, shop our LND Mascara and NEW collection of Tops, Shorts, Activewear, Joggers, Jewelry/Hair Accessories and MORE! (they sell SO FAST!) 👉🏻 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com">https://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com</a><br /><br />Of course Bailey and I are both super competitive, so we WENT HARD in this video trying to keep up with each other's points! Its perhaps the best part of being a twin, besides having a built in best friend!<br /><br />We posted on our IGS asking y'all to submit questions we were going to use for the video. Bailey and I then had to answer the questions how we thought the boys would! It was actually really hard because both Bailey and I felt like the boys weren’t answering how they normally would of... lol! <br /><br />Although it was a little unfair since Bailey and Asa have been together for 6 years, Dakota and I kept up better than we thought we would!! Watch the video to find out how we did and who won the challenge! What would you like to see us do next?
