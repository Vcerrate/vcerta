{% raw %}Plantar fasciitis is one of the most common causes of heel pain. It involves inflammation of a thick band of tissue that runs across the bottom of your foot and connects your heel bone to your toes (plantar fascia). Plantar fasciitis commonly causes stabbing pain that usually occurs with your first steps in the morning. Plantar fasciitis is more common in runners. People who are overweight and those who wear shoes with inadequate support also have an increased risk of plantar fasciitis. Know the causes and symptoms associated with plantar fasciitis and what are the lifestyle and home remedies that may help relieve the discomfort and pain.<br /><br />Cold Feet video link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/NEDOU2O6u08">https://youtu.be/NEDOU2O6u08</a><br /><br />Green E Philippines facebook pages:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/greenephilippines/">https://www.facebook.com/greenephilippines/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/elilifesaversph">https://www.facebook.com/elilifesaversph</a><br />For inquiries, please send a private message or call 09338560194(Sun) 09453413953(Globe)<br /><br />Gary S.
