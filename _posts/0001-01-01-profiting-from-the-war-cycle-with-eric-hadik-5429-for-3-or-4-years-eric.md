{% raw %}For 3 or 4 years, Eric has been discussing War Cycles and telling readers to wait until 2021 for those War Cycles to kick in… and that they should last into 2025.  We discuss his focus on late-2021 for this and what it means for the coming years.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Q2 - Since Oct ‘21, Eric was describing a scenario in Gold where you expected a rally into mid-Nov and then a larger rally from mid-Dec into this exact week in late-Feb ’22.  He explains how that fits into these War Cycles and what gold looks like moving forward.<br /><br /><br /><br /> We talk about Gold and the Dollar's simultaneous rallies.  Most traders think that is not possible but Eric has been consistent on this point.  <br /><br /><br /><br /> In the Dec &amp;amp; January issues of INSIIDE Track, Eric talked how Palladium had fulfilled major downside projections and was ready to begin a new bull market.  It's all making sense as Russia is the largest producer of Palladium. We cover his outlook impact other metals like Silver, Palladium and Platinum. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Turning the focus to other commodities, Eric has been continually calling for a major advance in Wheat prices in 2021 - 2022 and projecting a primary surge to 950 or higher. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Many topics covered during out discussion.{% endraw %}
