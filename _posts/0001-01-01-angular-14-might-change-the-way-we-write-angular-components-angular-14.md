{% raw %}Angular 14 was released and it introduces two exciting new features / changes:<br />- Typed (Reactive) Forms<br />- Standalone Components<br /><br />Especially standalone components could change the way we build Angular apps forever - at least once the feature is fully stable and out of &quot;Developer Preview&quot; (in which it currently still is).<br />Writing Angular apps might become easier and require less boilerplate code. ðŸ™‚<br /><br />Also read the official announcement blog post: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.angular.io/angular-v14-is-now-available-391a6db736af">https://blog.angular.io/angular-v14-is-now-available-391a6db736af</a><br /><br />I did also add a brand-new section about &quot;Standalone Components&quot; to my &quot;Angular - The Complete Guide&quot; course.<br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ Join now (and get a nice discount!): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://acad.link/angular">https://acad.link/angular</a><br /><br />You find all my other courses here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://academind.com/courses">https://academind.com/courses</a><br />Join our Academind Community on Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://academind.com/community">https://academind.com/community</a><br /><br />Check out all our other courses: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://academind.com/courses">https://academind.com/courses</a><br /><br />----------<br /><br />â€¢ Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.academind.com">https://www.academind.com</a> and subscribe to our newsletter to stay updated and to get exclusive content &amp; discounts<br />â€¢ Follow @maxedapps and @academind_real on Twitter<br />â€¢ Follow @academind_real on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/academind_real">https://www.instagram.com/academind_real</a><br />â€¢ Join our Facebook community on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/academindchannel/">https://www.facebook.com/academindchannel/</a><br /><br />See you in the videos!<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Academind is your source for online education in the areas of web development, frontend web development, backend web development, programming, coding and data science!
