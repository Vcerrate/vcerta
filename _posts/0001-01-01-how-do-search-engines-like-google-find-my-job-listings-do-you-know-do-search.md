{% raw %}Do you know do search engines work when it come to finding and indexing your job listings. It's one thing to post jobs on Indeed and ZipRecruiter. But getting them to be near the top when a job seeker searches is a whole new ballgame.  That's why recruitment marketing is in high demand. But very few recruiters and HR professionals know how job boards or search engines like Google really work.

I’ve been called the “Millennial trapped in a Baby Boomer body” for a reason.  Although I’ve been around the workforce for a few decades (and in this business for over 20 years), my mind races toward the future and how technology and change are disrupting everything we know about jobs, careers, and work. As more companies struggle to acquire and retain top talent, my purpose is helping companies reinvent their recruitment and hiring practices. <br /><br />By subscribing to my video channel, newsletter, and blogs, you’ll receive a constant flow of leading edge ideas, tips, and disruptive trends. I don’t expect everyone to embrace and implement every recommendation but I’ll guarantee they will start critical conversations.<br /><br />For more recruitment and hiring tips visit one of Ira Wolfe’s blogs at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.successperformancesolutions.com">https://www.successperformancesolutions.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.perfectlaborstorm.com">https://www.perfectlaborstorm.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/rework/users/ira-s-wolfe">https://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/rework/users/ira-s-wolfe</a><br /><br />Subscribe for more video recruitment and hiring tips here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=irawolfe">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=irawolfe</a><br /><br />Prefer podcasts?
