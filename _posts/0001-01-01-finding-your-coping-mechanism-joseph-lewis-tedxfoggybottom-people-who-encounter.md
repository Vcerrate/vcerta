{% raw %}People who encounter policeman Joseph Lewis are confused by his habit of smiling whenever in danger, a coping technique he developed during his difficult childhood in Liberia and homelessness in the United States. By developing genuine gratitude for others, Joseph believes we can all react more positively to fear in any form.<br /> <br />Joseph Lewis is a law enforcement officer for DC Metro, a community advocate for the Lutheran Immigration Refugee Service, a seminary student, and a former refugee. Born in Liberia, he lived a normal life up until 1989, when a civil war broke out in the area. After facing multiple setbacks for the remainder of his childhood and the beginning of his adult life, Joseph migrated to the United States where he settled into a life of homelessness. Encouragement from those in his local community inspired Joseph to go to college and earn a degree. Through his experiences, Joseph has become a key community figure and source of inspiration, actively telling his story and encouraging others to do the same. <br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
