Andrew runs Stanford’s lab (the Huberman Lab) primarily studying brain states – such as fear, courage, anxiety, calm – and how we can better move into and out of them through things like visual cues, breathwork, movement, supplementation, and the like. All incredibly interesting research.<br /><br />Outside the lab he’s worked with US elite military forces and professional athletes to help them manage their own brain states through his research.<br /><br />—<br /><br />It’s always a pleasure talking with Andrew – he has a wealth of knowledge and is so generous with his time and comfortable with sharing all he knows. If you’re ready to take your health to the next level by upleveling your sleep, then this episode is for you. And now, please join me for Episode 1,219 of The School of Greatness!{% endraw %}
