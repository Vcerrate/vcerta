{% raw %}In this video from Learn Electrics, we will look at the condition codes that are used when completing an Electrical Installation Condition Report or EICR.<br />Many electricians, especially those new to the trade will ask what code should be put for this or that.<br />And they will want to know if there is an easy way to work it out a condition code.<br />Whilst the actual condition codes are decided by the inspector on the spot at that time, there are general areas of conformity to the codes and in this short video we will show you just one method of how to look at observations and faults on an electrical circuit and how to decide on the appropriate code.<br /><br />This video is No.137 on our YouTube channel where we have videos on a wide range of electrical topics.<br /><br />To see a full list of all our   LearnElectrics   videos, click on the link below.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYaJQnpO4XAp0yCgqzMkmfA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYaJQnpO4XAp0yCgqzMkmfA</a><br /><br /><br /><br />You can also view all our videos by typing    LearnElectrics   all one word into the YouTube search bar.<br /><br />Always work safely, electricity can be dangerous.
