{% raw %}US President Joe Biden’s inability to answer even the most basic questions from handpicked journalists raises serious questions about his fitness for office, according to Sky News host Rita Panahi.<br /><br />President Joe Biden held a nearly two hour press conference to mark his first year in office.<br /><br />Ms Panahhi said the president “is clearly noy all there.”<br /><br />“The cognitive decline is obvious and frankly a little sad,” she said.<br /><br />“The most basic of questions, from handpicked journalists and he still can't articulate a simple message. Not only does he struggle to answer the simplest of questions but he also has a habit of going off on odd, incoherent tangents.”{% endraw %}
