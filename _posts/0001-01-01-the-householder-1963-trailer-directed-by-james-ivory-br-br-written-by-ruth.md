Only then, in Indu's absence, does Prem fall in love with his wife...<br /><br /><br /><br />Visit The Movie Planet: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://themovieplanet.wordpress.com/">http://themovieplanet.wordpress.com/</a><br /><br />Official site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.merchantivory.com/householder.html">http://www.merchantivory.com/householder.html</a><br /><br />IMDB: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057162/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057162/</a>{% endraw %}
