Официальный видеоканал <br /><br /><br />Hello Guys,<br /><br />It's time to build something really complicated.<br />This is  kind of experimental video. I have a very old unrealized idea about an internal combustion engine, if be more correctly intake and exhaust system. Usually valves perform this function, in our case it is a camshaft with channels for passing gases.<br />Ideas can be very logical and interesting on paper, but in practice it is very difficult to prove. <br />So let's build  a brand-new engine with never seen before  intake and exhaust system and prove this idea. Whether it will work or not is a very big question. Let's find out.<br /><br />If this engine works as planned, then it can be built into any car or even build some kind of all-terrain vehicle.<br /><br />Friends,<br /><br />As you have already noticed, I read almost all of your messages and am happy to share my ideas with you, and as far as possible, I listen to your opinion.<br />Share your opinion on this and leave comments.<br /><br />With best regards<br /><br />Meanwhile in the Garage<br /><br />#diyproject<br />#diyEngine<br />#buildingEngine<br />#wot #ad #sponsored{% endraw %}
