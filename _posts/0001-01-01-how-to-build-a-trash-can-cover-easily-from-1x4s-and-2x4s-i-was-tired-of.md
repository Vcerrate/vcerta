{% raw %}I was tired of chasing our trash can across ours and the neighbors yard with all the wind we've been having recently where we live.  So I built a trash can cover/container to keep it in and it not only contains it, but also covers up it's unsightliness.<br /><br />This easy to build project was built entirely from 1x4s and 2x4s.  I recommend using treated wood OR cedar, but if you use standard lumber, and finish well, it should still last a while.<br /><br />Free building plans can be found here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buildsomething.com/plans/P13967999DF70A1EF/DIY-Trash-Can-Cover">https://www.buildsomething.com/plans/P13967999DF70A1EF/DIY-Trash-Can-Cover</a><br /><br />And more details and project ideas can be found here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.woodshopdiaries.com/diy-trash-can-cover/">https://www.woodshopdiaries.com/diy-trash-can-cover/</a>{% endraw %}
