{% raw %}It seems to be a bedroom in a house with a pond in front of the house. I think the owner of the house is a person who likes candles very much. Not just one or two candles, but many! It's heavy rain, so I'm very satisfied with the sound of rain hitting the windows, which I like a lot. The appearance of nature is blurred, and watching the rain pouring down the window is healing. If I open the window for a moment out of curiosity, rainwater will just come in.😁.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br /><br />It's been a while since I uploaded a video.
