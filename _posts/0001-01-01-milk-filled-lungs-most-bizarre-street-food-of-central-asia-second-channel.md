I’m from the US but I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer.<br /> <br />If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />🎬 CREDITS:<br />HOST » Sonny Side<br />DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY » Nguyễn Tân Khải<br />CAMERA OPERATOR » Abduvali Samigov<br />VIDEO EDITOR » Dương Quốc Huy<br />COLOR &amp; MASTER » Quí Nguyễn<br />PRODUCER » Huỳnh Hà My<br />PRODUCTION COORDINATOR » Huynh Nhi<br />LOCAL PRODUCER » Behruz Hamzaev<br />LOCAL PA  » Aslan Muydinoff (@mdnffa)<br />Selected tracks via Audio Network<br />For business inquiries: marketing@befrs.com{% endraw %}
