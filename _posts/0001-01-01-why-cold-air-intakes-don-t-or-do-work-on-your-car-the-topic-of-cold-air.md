{% raw %}The topic of cold air intakes is a much argued one. So many videos on YouTube try and say why they work, or prove they don't work in various applications and models of car and many just show one example. But has anyone ever explained the reasons many do or don't work and when you should and shouldn't change your stock intake? In this Motive Tech we look into the science behind why aftermarket intakes do and do not work and give you the knowledge you need to asses the product and its application. We also have quite a few real world examples from what we have personally done. <br /><br />Get your Motive Video merchandise here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://motive.bigcartel.com/">https://motive.bigcartel.com/</a><br />Get the GT-R parts we recommend here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gtrhub.bigcartel.com/">https://gtrhub.bigcartel.com/</a><br />Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Motivevideo">https://www.facebook.com/Motivevideo</a><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/motive_video/">https://www.instagram.com/motive_video/</a><br /><br />Motive Video creates content on modified performance cars, focussing on Japanese cars, but also European and hi-tech V8s.
