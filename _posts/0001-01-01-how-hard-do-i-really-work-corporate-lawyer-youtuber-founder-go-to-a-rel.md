Thanks to Athletic Greens for sponsoring today's video!<br /><br />Between trying to shake off the feeling that I'm wasting my life by binging 4 episodes of Love Is Blind Japan (hustle culture is NOT the one) and wanting to feel fulfilled and successful in my work and home lives, I think a lot about how much is the RIGHT amount of work. How long should we be spending working? And when am I crossing the line into unhealthy overworking? <br /><br />So, in this video, I open up about how much I really work. I share how I think about hard work as a young lawyer, content creator and start-up founder, and my opinions on all things hustle culture, productivity, downtime and balance üòµ<br /><br />Super interested to hear what you think about all these questions, so please do hmu in the comments!<br /><br />‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.<br /><br />AG1 by Athletic Greens is a comprehensive, nutrition drink engineered to fill the nutritional gaps in your diet and support your body‚Äôs nutritional needs across four pillars of health: Gut health, Immune support, Energy and Recovery!

I graduated from Cambridge University (where I studied French and Spanish), topped my law school class and now work for a corporate law firm in London as a trainee solicitor (which takes up a lot of my time)!<br /><br />Around that, I'm a big fan of discovering new ways of thinking, of balancing work with life, and of performing to the very best of my ability. Ohh, and being happy. And I try to share all that on this YouTube channel üòÄ<br /><br />Fun fact: I believe we massively overplay the role of ‚Äúnatural talent‚Äù üòÆ AND‚Ä¶ I also believe that TOGETHER, WE ARE ALL CAPABLE OF POSITIVITY, PRODUCTIVITY AND SUCCESS.<br /><br />üì∏  Instagram ‚Äì <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/liam.porritt/">https://www.instagram.com/liam.porritt/</a><br />üåç  My little kingdom ‚Äì <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://liamporritt.com">https://liamporritt.com</a>{% endraw %}
