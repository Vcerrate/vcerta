{% raw %}The health of your neck is the secret to a beautiful face💯 If you have lots of tension in that area then you will inhibit lymphatic drainage and blood flow which will make your face puffy, wrinkly, and dull in the long run. This is why I thought I show you some great Gua She moves for the neck - to stretch, tone, sculpt and elongate that area 😊 If you do not have a Gua She at hand you can also use your hands, a spoon or anything which can be cleaned and has a similar shape to a Gua Sha ✨<br />I’m excited to hear what you think 💖<br /><br />If you want to enhance your skin further, then you should also start with facial exercises. Massaging your face will release tension &amp; working out your face will sculpt &amp; tone your facial muscles - your skin will appear more plump, sculpted &amp; toned. <br /><br />The best way to start with that is to join the program at<br />❤️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.allyoucanface.com/">https://www.allyoucanface.com/</a> <br /><br />Find us also on 🤳<br />⭐️Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/allyoucanface/">https://www.instagram.com/allyoucanface/</a><br />⭐️Tiktok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@allyoucanface">https://www.tiktok.com/@allyoucanface</a><br />⭐️Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/allyoucanface">https://www.facebook.com/allyoucanface</a><br /><br />🌸For a full list of our recommended products: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shoplist.us/allyoucanface">https://shoplist.us/allyoucanface</a><br /><br />📺Here is the list of videos I’m mentioning in that video: <br />Spoon Massage: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNDcuZGj2TE&amp;t=60s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNDcuZGj2TE&amp;t=60s</a> <br /><br /><br />For business inquiries: mail@allyoucanface.com<br /><br />Music: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: We aren't a dermatologist or licensed aesthetician facility.
