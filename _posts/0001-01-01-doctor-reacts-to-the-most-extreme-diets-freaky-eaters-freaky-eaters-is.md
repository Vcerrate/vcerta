{% raw %}Freaky Eaters is a TLC show that highlights individuals who have unusual diets, very similar to My Strange Addiction. Often this means people who exclusively eat one thing, such as potatoes, cheese, meat, bread, burnt sausage, and many others. There are also episodes depicting a woman who drinks upwards of 30 Coca Cola’s a day, a man who eats raw chicken and meat, or a man who just eats cheeseburgers. I take a look at all of these cases today to discuss two things: what the impact of these diets are on the human body, and what tactics the show’s producers and medical experts use to help these people. As always, let’s lead with empathy in trying to understand where these individuals are coming from and we can all improve our diets to live happier and healthier!<br /><br />I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously.
