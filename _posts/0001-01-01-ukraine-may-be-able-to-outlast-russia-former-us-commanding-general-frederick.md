{% raw %}Former US Commanding General Frederick Benjamin Hodges says if Ukraine if given all the tools it needs, it may be able to &quot;outlast&quot; Russia. <br /><br />&quot;After 18 days, I think the Kremlin figured they would've had it all wrapped up and conducting their victory celebrations,&quot; Mr Benjamin told Sky News host Peta Credlin. <br /><br />&quot;Instead, I think that they are about 10 days away from reaching their culminating point - meaning they are running out of people, they're running out of ammunitions, and they're running out of time.<br /><br />&quot;This is a race, if we, the west, can get Ukraine all the things, the tools it needs to be able to defend itself, I think they're going to outlast Russia.{% endraw %}
