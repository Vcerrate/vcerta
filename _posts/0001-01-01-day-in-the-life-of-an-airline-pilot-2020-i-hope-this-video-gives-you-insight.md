{% raw %}I hope this video gives you insight of what life is like during the current situation as an airline pilot. I know things will get better but it will take time! This video was filmed 4/27/20 and it just shows how different regional flying is right now. Before, I would sometimes do 5 flights in one day and now its no more than 2. <br /><br />www.flytapparel.com <br /><br />Instagram: @flywithgarrett<br />Instagram: @flyt.apparel<br />Facebook: @flywithgarrett<br />Twitter: @flywithgarrett<br /><br />*footage on the taxi way on from a previous deadheading flight as a passenger*{% endraw %}
