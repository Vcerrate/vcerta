{% raw %}Amber Heard Might Have To â€˜Sell Herselfâ€™ To Pay Off Johnny Depp!<br />It seems like things are getting a lot crazier for Amber Heard, especially after she lost the defamation case against Johnny Depp. And right now, she has $15 million worth of damage she needs to pay. The problem is that even her lawyers confirmed that Amber could not pay that large sum of money, and the fact that no one wants to hire her after her lies were exposed is making things worse. This is why an anonymous Saudi man decided to take the initiative and offer Amber a way out of her debts, and the internet has had mixed reactions to it.<br /><br />Here on Film Streak we are all about the latest spill in Hollywood!
