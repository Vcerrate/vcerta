{% raw %}cannot get a Link light on either my switch nor my old APC appliance.   This simple trick saved the day.  <br /><br />Once I realized that my old @Schneider Electric APC (and very reliable!) appliance only could connect at 10Mbps, the issue became apparent that more modern switches have left this speed behind.<br /><br />This video shows how just inserting a switch capable of being able to act as in intermediary between the two solves this problem.<br /><br />This can also be a good troubleshooting step when a switch won't negotiate a link (even when it should!).{% endraw %}
