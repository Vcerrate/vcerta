{% raw %}Many people have said the Barrett M82 and M107 is inaccurate. Considering it is not a sniper rifle but rather an anti material rifle, it's said to only be as accurate as it needs to be. But in this video I try out some Hornady A-MAX 750 grain match ammo alongside 660 grain XM33 ball ammo and answer, is the Barrett M82 inaccurate? Groups were at 100 yards and steel was over a mile away at 1,817 yards shooting the A-MAX rounds. So what do y'all think?{% endraw %}
