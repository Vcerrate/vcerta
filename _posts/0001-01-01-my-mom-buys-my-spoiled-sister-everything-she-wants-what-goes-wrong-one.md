{% raw %}One Sunday morning, I woke up to my sister screaming. I ran out of my room in a panic but the house was empty. When my sister Alice screamed again, I realized she was in the backyard. When I ran outside, I couldn’t believe my eyes. Her screams had scared me but she was actually screaming with glee. My mom gave her a white miniature horse. “Mom, are you serious?!? I can’t believe you! Did you get her a real horse now?” I yelled.{% endraw %}
