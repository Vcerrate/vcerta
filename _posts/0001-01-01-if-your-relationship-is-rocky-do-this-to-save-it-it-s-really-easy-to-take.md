{% raw %}It’s really easy to take your frustrations out on your relationship right now. Whether you’re the one who’s nagging or it’s your partner who is nagging you, this video is a relationship saver.<br /><br /><br />Resentment is poison and once you start to go down the road of blaming your partner, bickering, or judging them, you’re only adding to the stress that your partner already feels. If you’re the one who’s being made wrong, you know exactly what I’m talking about. If you’re struggling to communicate, there’s only one thing that will turn this around and get you back on track. You need to triple down on the encouragement.<br /><br /><br />It’s easy to bitch about the things you don’t like, try spending the next 24 hours calling out all the things you see that they’re doing right and that you appreciate and you’ll be shocked at how quickly it changes your relationship for the better. Even if you’re the one who’s getting picked on, being more encouraging will show your partner what YOU need.<br /><br /><br />Everyone feels beaten down right now, so the last thing you need is more negativity. Share this video with your partner and sit down and talk through how you can both be more supportive of one another ❤️<br /><br />---<br /><br />#StayConnected with Mel Robbins<br />What: Live Broadcast to #StayConnected<br />When: 9AM LA | 12PM NYC | 4PM UK | 9:30PM India<br />Where: @MelRobbins Facebook | Instagram | YouTube⁠ | Twitter | LinkedIn<br /><br />If you miss me live, all the #StayConnected videos are here on YouTube.<br /><br />Xo<br />Mel<br /><br />--- <br /><br />Subscribe to the channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...</a><br /><br />--- <br /><br />Follow me here: <br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/melrobbins/">https://www.instagram.com/melrobbins/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/melrobbins">http://facebook.com/melrobbins</a> <br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://melrobbins.com">http://melrobbins.com</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/melrobbins">http://twitter.com/melrobbins</a><br /><br />--- <br /><br />See where you can watch The Mel Robbins Show on TV here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.melrobbinsshow.com">https://www.melrobbinsshow.com</a><br /><br />Or watch full episodes here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/melrobbinsshow">https://www.youtube.com/melrobbinsshow</a><br /><br />--- <br /><br />Sign up for my weekly letter written to YOU at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://melrobbins.com/newsletter/">https://melrobbins.com/newsletter/</a><br /><br />Get three free guides + my #MindsetReset program at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://melrobbins.com/mindsetreset/">https://melrobbins.com/mindsetreset/</a>{% endraw %}
