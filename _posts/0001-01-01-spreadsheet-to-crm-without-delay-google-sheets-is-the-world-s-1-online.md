{% raw %}Google Sheets is the worldâ€™s #1 online spreadsheet platform, and now itâ€™s in sync with amoCRM! That means no more juggling files for exporting and importing. So, whether you enter data into your sheets manually or collect Google Forms entries automatically â€” every new row in your spreadsheet will automatically create a lead in your amoCRM account.<br />              <br />Donâ€™t let leads rot in spreadsheets. Drive more conversions by sending them where the sales team spends the most time: your CRM. In amoCRM, youâ€™ll be notified the moment a new lead appears, and Digital Pipeline can start engaging them with automated nurture sequences.<br /><br />From registering event attendees to capturing requests for quotes, you can count on Google Forms to collect leads of all kinds. And since Google Forms feeds directly into to Google Sheets, this integration lets you send new leads straight to your pipeline automatically.<br /><br /><br />Learn more about Google Sheets ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3NA45rw">https://bit.ly/3NA45rw</a><br />Test drive amoCRM for free for 2 weeks ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3DnuhB6">https://bit.ly/3DnuhB6</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/amoCRMUS/">https://www.facebook.com/amoCRMUS/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/amocrm">https://twitter.com/amocrm</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/amocrm/">https://www.instagram.com/amocrm/</a><br />Linkedin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/amocrm/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/amocrm/</a><br /><br />#messengerbasedsales{% endraw %}
