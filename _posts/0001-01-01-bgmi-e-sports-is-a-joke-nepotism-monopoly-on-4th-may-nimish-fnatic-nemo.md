{% raw %}On 4th May, Nimish “fnatic_nemo” Raut - global head of partnerships and business development at NODWIN Gaming, took to social media to slam the Indian esports industry calling it a “joke”. Nemo’s outburst comes after a recent announcement through which the Indian gaming livestream platform Loco was announced as the “powered by sponsor” of official Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) esports tournaments for 2022.<br /><br />Note: Raut is the former India head of global esports organization Fnatic and is no longer associated with it in an official capacity.<br /><br />At the time of writing this article, Raut was not reachable for comment. However, his Instagram story indicates that Raut believes that a portion of the media rights revenue from the Loco-BGMI esports deal should be shared with the teams in the ecosystem.<br /><br />Raut also tagged various stakeholders in the industry such as Godlike, TSM India, Penta Esports, Sky Esports, The Esports Club, NODWIN Gaming, Chemin Esports, Team Soul, Orangutan, Esports Network and yours truly. He asked whether this was good or bad for esports, while questioning the allegedly non-existent share of media rights for “teams who put on the show”.<br /><br />With Loco being announced as the “powered by sponsor 2022” for BGMI esports, several open questions have emerged. To begin with, it is unclear if the tournaments will be broadcasted exclusively on Loco or on other livestream platforms as well. Through comments on Loco’s announcement about the sponsorship, fans have been fairly vocal about their aversion to an exclusive broadcast.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Follow me on rooter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://web.rooter.gg/user-profile/2009834868">https://web.rooter.gg/user-profile/2009834868</a><br /><br /><br /><br />You can join my Whatsapp Group for sending news and for chat - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/Lw6ljH3nd94CiAkiilXkIR">https://chat.whatsapp.com/Lw6ljH3nd94CiAkiilXkIR</a><br /><br />My second channel - <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewBZNMJOn7bnhFsHH4CShA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewBZNMJOn7bnhFsHH4CShA</a><br /><br />Sponsored By - <br />Extra0rdinnary is sponsored by GemWire - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gemwire.gg/">https://www.instagram.com/gemwire.gg/</a><br /><br />For Support..My UPI ID - oextreo@okhdfcbank<br /><br />If you want me to cover any news or topics ?
