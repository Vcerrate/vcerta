{% raw %}Finally US Tests The New Super A-10 Warthog<br /><br />The A-10 Warthog or Thunderbolt II is the most legendary aircraft throughout decades of combat operations. In 2014, the USAF saw the first attempt to completely retire the A-10 to save $3.7 billion across the five-year future-year defense program and another $500 million in cost avoidance for upgrades.
