{% raw %}For the 5th year on the trot, here is the cheapest Electric Tariff for an electric car owner who charges at home! Who will win this year!?<br /><br />Website: www.ev-man.co.uk<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/evmanuk">https://twitter.com/evmanuk</a><br />PLEASE READ FOR OCTOPUS REFERRAL:<br />Octopus have temporarily switched off Online Switching for all customers due to the price cap (which increases in April, so I expect it to be back by then) and the advice that switching right now could be more expensive for an average customer. You can still switch but you have to ring them to do so. This also means that referrals have to be done manually as well which will require me to give you my account number.<br />Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ev-man.co.uk/contact/">http://ev-man.co.uk/contact/</a> if you would like my referral and I will email you back with this.<br /><br />If youâ€™re sure that Go is the best tariff for you (even before the price cap increases, it is for me as an EV driver who charges off peak) then follow the link below and follow their instructions.<br /><br />Octopus Referral: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://share.octopus.energy/ore-cobra-425">https://share.octopus.energy/ore-cobra-425</a><br /><br /><br />#charging #energysupplier #electriccars{% endraw %}
