{% raw %}This video showcases our most recent business highlights and sustainable innovations as the world leader in lighting.<br /><br />Watch our Q4 2021 Business Highlights video! We were included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 5th year in a row, announced our intention to acquire Fluence to strengthen our Agriculture growth platform, and helped El Dorado International Airport reduce its carbon footprint with thousands of 3D printed downlights and LED retrofits. We also added a layer of protection to football players of Standard Liege in Belgium and guests and staff at restaurants of the TTFB chain in Taiwan, thanks to Philips UV-C disinfection devices. And world's largest observation wheel, Ain Dubai, now is fully LED.<br /><br />Watch the video to check out our other progress on driving sustainable lighting innovations!<br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Signifycompany">https://twitter.com/Signifycompany</a><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/signifycompany/mycompany/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/signifycompany/mycompany/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/signifycompany/Signify">https://www.instagram.com/signifycompany/Signify</a><br /><br /><br /><br />#Signify #businesshighlights #lighting #innovation #sustainability #quarterlies #results #interact #connectedlighting #greenswitch #IoT #UVC  #brighterlivesbetterworld #3dprinting{% endraw %}
