We do not own the clips and music we use in most cases. Our understanding is that it is in correlation to Fair Right Use, however, given that it is open to interpretation, if any owners of the content clips would like us to remove the video, we have no problem with that and will do so as fast as possible. Please message us on YouTube or Facebook if you have any concerns.<br /><br />We believe these videos are fair use because: <br /><br />They are transformative in a positive sense, we take clips from various sources to help create an atmospheric feeling that will help people in hard situations in their life. <br /><br />We also do not wish to use the heart of any piece of work that would perhaps decrease the market value of the original content, if anything we hope to promote the content so that people can reach out and subsequently increase the market value. <br /><br />Lastly, these videos are to educate people in an entertaining fashion.
