{% raw %}Î®πÎäî ÏΩîÎ°úÎÇò19 ÏπòÎ£åÏ†ú, ÏõêÍ≤©ÏßÑÎ£åÎ∂ÄÌÑ∞ Ìà¨ÏïΩÍπåÏßÄ<br /><br />Around a week has passed since the country received Pfizer's oral treatment.<br />Dozens of patients have been given the pills.<br />To check out how Paxlovid is being adminstered, our Choi Min-jung went to a residential treatment center.<br />This COVID-19 patient is being treated with Paxlovid, Pfizer's antiviral drug.<br />He is currently being looked after at a residential treatment center in Seoul,‚Ä¶ and is very close to completing the course of pills.<br /><br />&quot;You took Paxlovid for four days now and there is only one day left of treatment. Are you feeling any better?&quot;<br />&quot;I cough less and my throat is no longer itchy.&quot;<br />&quot;Right, you're no longer coughing now.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Just like this patient, many people are expected to take the pills in the days and weeks to come. Now let's take a look at how Paxlovid is prescribed and administered.&quot;<br /><br />Before prescribing the treatment,... doctors first consult with the patients using non-contact methods,‚Ä¶ to check their health.<br />Doctors then use the Drug Utilization Review program, also known as DUR.<br />This program uses the patients' prescription history to help doctors determine whether or not patients can take the pills.<br />This is important,‚Ä¶ as a total of 28 drug substances are designated as ingredients that should not be taken together with Paxlovid.<br />If the patient is eligible and is willing to receive the treatment, the medicine is administered twice a day,‚Ä¶ once in the morning, and once in the evening.<br />And medical workers regularly monitor patients' health conditions after they take the pills.<br /><br />The director at this treatment center expressed optimism over the drug's potential to become a game changer amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant.<br /><br />&quot;I believe that Paxlovid will play a crucial role in preventing moderate cases from becoming severe. Studies have shown that the treatment is around 90-percent effective, so it will be essential in times when infections are increasing due to Omicron.&quot;<br /><br />Unlike the relatively slow initial vaccine rollout, South Korea was able to become one of the first nations in the world to administer the COVID-19 pills.<br />The first shipment of Paxlovid arrived last week.<br />And over the first three days after arrival, a total of 39 people have taken the pills, with no reports of side-effects as of Sunday.<br />Choi Min-jung, Arirang News.<br /><br />#COVID19 #drug #vaccine<br /><br />üì£ Arirang News(Facebook) : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/arirangtvnews">https://www.facebook.com/arirangtvnews</a><br />üì£ Arirang News(Twitter) : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/arirangtvnews">https://twitter.com/arirangtvnews</a><br />üì£ News Center(YouTube) : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NEWSCENTER_ARIRANGTV">https://www.youtube.com/c/NEWSCENTER_ARIRANGTV</a><br /><br /><br />2022-01-20, 22:00 (KST){% endraw %}
