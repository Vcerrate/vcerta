In this video, we present a foreshadowing lesson for filmmakers and storytellers. Not only covering the difference between direct foreshadowing and indirect foreshadowing but how these techniques can be applied. From the obvious applications of foreshadowing like dialogue down to the details like props, music, and production design.<br /><br />Foreshadowing Definition<br /><br />At the basic level, foreshadowing is anything that indicates or hints at future events in a story. Between the two types of foreshadowing, we either recognize these hints right away or only in hindsight. But in either case, it can create a cohesive story in which the audience becomes intrigued at how it will all turn out.<br /><br />What is direct foreshadowing?<br /><br />Direct foreshadowing is obvious to the audience right away. But even then, there is a spectrum of presentations — from clear indications of what will happen later in the story to simply hints that leave room for ambiguity or subversion. For example, in The Tragedy of Macbeth, the witches state outright that Macbeth will one day take the throne. But rather than ruining the ending, we are more intrigued by how he slowly corrupts his soul in the process. <br /><br />In Frozen, we are told that the only way to cure Anna’s curse is through “an act of true love.” The filmmakers use our expectations of a “romantic” love but it is revealed that it is a sister’s love that breaks the spell.<br />What is indirect foreshadowing?<br /><br />Indirect foreshadowing is only obvious in hindsight, either at the end of the film or upon a second viewing. This is different from easter eggs, which are deliberately hidden inside jokes or clues but have little to no bearing on the actual plot. For example, in Ari Aster’s horror fairy tale Midsommar, the first image we see is pure indirect foreshadowing. We open with a mural that lays out the entire plot of the film. Of course, we can’t recognize that before we’ve seen the film but it works as indirect foreshadowing nonetheless. It gives the tragedy a sense of inevitability — that Dani was always meant to find herself among the Harga and that the demise of her friends was similarly foretold.<br /><br />Foreshadowing in films is everywhere and if you’re looking for tips on how to write foreshadowing in your next script, these examples should give you a head start. It is a skill that all storytellers, no matter the medium or genre, can use to bring the audience into the narrative.<br /><br /><br />#FilmTheory #VideoEssay #Filmmaking<br /><br />─────────────────────<br /><br />♬  SONGS USED:<br /><br />&quot;I'm Shipping Up to Boston&quot; - Dropkick Murphys<br />&quot;A Glowing Light, A Promise&quot; - Makeup and Vanity Set<br />&quot;Remote Interface&quot; - Makeup and Vanity Set<br />&quot;Choke&quot; - Makeup and Vanity Set<br />&quot;Free Your Mind&quot; - Don Davis<br />&quot;My Black Desires&quot; - Carter Burwell<br />&quot;No Regrets&quot; - Makeup and Vanity Set<br />&quot;Amber&quot; - Makeup and Vanity Set<br />&quot;Vuelie (Featuring Cantus)&quot; - Christophe Beck<br />&quot;Royal Blue - Instrumental&quot; - Makeup and Vanity Set<br />&quot;Don't Stop Me Now&quot; - Queen<br />&quot;Crush&quot; - Makeup and Vanity Set<br />&quot;Prophesy&quot; - Bobby Krlic<br />&quot;Gassed&quot; - Bobby Krlic<br />&quot;Fire Temple&quot; - Bobby Krlic<br />&quot;Stuck Behind a Train - Instrumental&quot; - Makeup and Vanity Set<br />&quot;The Name's Bond...
