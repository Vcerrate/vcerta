Parents Matt and Klara, from Doncaster, UK, had a set of twins four years ago: a boy named Arlo and a girl named Emerald. But Matt and Klara noticed their daughter was unhappy with wearing dresses and growing long hair. The four-year-old, who now goes by the name Stormy, told his parents when he was just two-years-old, that he was a boy. Matt said: 'He was genuinely upset with being dressed as a girl. There was a point where I thought, this isn't just a phase. This isn't a little girl we are looking at here. It's a little boy.' The parents, who initially thought gender dysmorphia was a 'made up' idea, are now fully supportive of Stormy's transition. The parents have been criticised on social media for 'forcing their own views' on their child. But Matt and Klara believe they are doing what is best for Stormy. Klara said: 'All I hope for is that Stormy is comfortable with being Stormy.'<br /><br />Follow Stormy Here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/stormy_x_stormy/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/stormy_x_stormy/?hl=en</a><br /><br />Videographer: Jan Bednarz<br />Producers: Emilia Jiang, Becky Robinson<br />Editor: Tom Buckman<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
