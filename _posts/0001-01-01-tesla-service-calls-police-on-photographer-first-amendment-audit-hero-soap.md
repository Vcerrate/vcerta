I arrived shortly after they opened at 10am. After gathering some footage, I was met by a representative questioning what I was doing. I declined to answer his questions. I did however offer him some free literature on California public photography laws, he declined &amp; stated he'd be calling police. After a while,  Officer Dean from the Costa Mesa Police Department arrived on scene. I informed the officer that I attempted to offer the literature &amp; figured he would feel more comfortable hearing it from law enforcement.<br />#FIrstAmendmentAudit #1AAudit #FirstAmendmentRights #PublicPhotography #SOuthernCalifornia #OrangeCounty{% endraw %}
