{% raw %}This topic has been requested a lot. Transitioning to a constant speed propeller aircraft can be intimidating at first, but once you understand the &quot;why&quot; and how it impacts each phase of flight, it doesn't have to be that complicated. In this video I wanted to try to explain how to transition from a fixed pitch propeller to a variable pitch / constant speed propeller. I hope it helps you in your aviation journey!<br /><br />Article mentioned in the video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://airplaneacademy.com/is-high-manifold-pressure-with-low-rpm-oversquare-bad/">https://airplaneacademy.com/is-high-manifold-pressure-with-low-rpm-oversquare-bad/</a><br /><br />Video Chapters:<br />0:00 Doesn’t Have to Be Intimidating<br />0:12 The “Why”<br />1:08 The Downside of Fixed Pitch Props<br />1:34 Differences by Phase of Flight<br />1:58 Differences - Takeoff &amp; Climb<br />2:37 How to Control Power<br />4:00 Change RPMs or Manifold Pressure First?<br />4:49 Oversquare Flying<br />6:26 Differences - Climb &amp; Cruise<br />7:36 Differences - Descent<br />8:40 Differences - Landing<br />8:52 Many Times It’s Exactly the Same!<br /><br />==<br /><br />Looking to start your aviation journey but not sure where to begin?
