{% raw %}There is a war on the Word of God today, and the enemy comes in all shapes and sizes. Some come covert in their assaults as wolves disguised in sheep's clothing, while others are unashamedly open with their hostility. There is still another kind of enemy living in our midst. Can we ever rid the church of this enemy of God's Word? How can we subdue it and bring it into submission? Looking at this, Dr. Sproul teaches us some tactical measures we can employ to overcome the assaults on Scripture that compromise our spiritual growth.<br /><br />This message is from our 2002 National Conference, War on the Word: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30acyfm60fX3FBBv0_h7QDQiRpXjAH4X">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30acyfm60fX3FBBv0_h7QDQiRpXjAH4X</a><br /><br />Purchase this conference on DVD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ligonier.org/store/war-on-the-word-2002-national-conference-dvd/?mobile=off">http://www.ligonier.org/store/war-on-the-word-2002-national-conference-dvd/?mobile=off</a>{% endraw %}
