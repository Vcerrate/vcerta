To your clients and community, you offer expertise, which enables them to achieve their goals and become financially independent. But what about your goals and independence? More importantly, what about your happiness?<br /><br />Maybe you have heavy decisions to make about selling or merging. Maybe you’re considering retirement. There are a variety of factors that could make your future feel uncertain—but that doesn’t mean it won’t be fulfilling. In Freedom Street, financial advisor and CEO Scott Danner shares lessons learned and insights gained from nearly two decades of managing assets, purchasing financial practices, and creating succession plans to ensure a future that is both prosperous and rewarding. With nearly fifty advisors in seven states, Scott’s practice manages more than $2 billion in assets. He knows what it takes to effectively balance your goals to serve your clients, make an impact in your community, and make your next chapter count. Sometimes even advisors need a guide. Learn what Scott did to create a rich life now, live his legacy today, and own the future of his dreams. <br /><br />Scott Danner is the CEO of Freedom Street Partners, a practice that supports financial advisors in their next career step and helps them explore all available paths to secure a fulfilling future. After fifteen years of practicing on an employee platform, Scott founded Freedom Street and took it from $0 to $3 billion in assets under management in just five years. Scott is the co-founder of the Chesapeake Virginia Wine Festival and enjoys traveling the country with his wife to watch their two sons play soccer.{% endraw %}
