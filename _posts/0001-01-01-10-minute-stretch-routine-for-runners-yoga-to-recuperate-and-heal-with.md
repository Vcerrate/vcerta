{% raw %}JOIN JEN'S LIVE YOGA CLASSES ONLINE - ALL CLASSES BY DONATION:<br />www.liveyogawithjen.com<br /><br />Welcome, my friends.  I'm Jen Hilman.  In today's video, I am going to guide you through some of my top stretches for all you runners out there.  It's important to stay flexible to avoid injury, and to also stretch after exercising in order to avoid tightness. <br /><br />Always listen to your body and only push to the comfortable level of what challenges you.  Remember: it is better to avoid injury and continue your practice tomorrow, than it is to risk injury and be forced to stop entirely.   <br /><br />JEN HILMAN<br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jenhilman/">https://www.instagram.com/jenhilman/</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/jen.hilman">https://www.facebook.com/jen.hilman</a><br /><br />Yoga for Sciatica:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Dx2Nk-Be40U">https://youtu.be/Dx2Nk-Be40U</a><br /><br />Thanks for joining me.
