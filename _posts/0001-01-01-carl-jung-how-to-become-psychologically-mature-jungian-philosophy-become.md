Jung was born in Switzerland in 1875 and died in 1961, leaving behind great works in the fields of psychiatry, anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, psychology and religious studies. Jung had Freud as a mentor for a good part of his career but later he departed from him. This division was painful for Jung and it led him to found his own school of psychology, called analytical psychology as a comprehensive system separate from psychoanalysis. If classical psychoanalysis focuses on the patient’s past, as early experiences are very important in personality development, analytical psychology primarily focuses on the present, on mythology, folklore, and cultural experiences, to try to understand human consciousness. One of the most important ideas of analytical psychology which Jung founded is the process of individuation, which is the process of finding the self - something Jung considered an important task in human development. While he did not formulate a systematic philosophy, he is nonetheless considered a sophisticated philosopher - his school of thought dubbed “Jungian philosophy”. Its concepts can apply to many topics covered in the humanities and the social sciences. A good part of his work was published after his death and indeed there are still some articles written by him that to this day have yet to be published. Some of his most important books are: “Psychology of the Unconscious”, “Man and His Symbols”, “The Archetypes and The Collective Unconscious”, “Modern Man In Search of a Soul”, “The Psychology of the Transference”, “Memories, Dreams, Thoughts”, and “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”. Besides being a great writer and a researcher, he was also an artist, a craftsman and even a builder. His contribution is enormous and there is a great deal we can learn from his works.<br /><br />Research/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://biancaszasz.com/">https://biancaszasz.com/</a><br /><br />Narration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dmcvoiceovers.com">https://www.dmcvoiceovers.com</a><br /><br />Music - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ</a><br /><br />Subscribe To Philosophies for Life<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ</a>{% endraw %}
