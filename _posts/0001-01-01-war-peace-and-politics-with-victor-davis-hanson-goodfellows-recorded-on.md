{% raw %}Recorded on May 20, 2022<br /><br />As the fighting in Ukraine continues, what’s the wisest strategy for the United States—keep sending weapons, help the Ukrainians broaden their operations, or advocate for a peaceful settlement? Victor Davis Hanson, the Hoover Institution’s Martin and Illie Anderson Senior Fellow, joins senior fellows John Cochrane, Niall Ferguson, and H. R. McMaster for a spirited debate regarding the breadth of American involvement overseas, Donald Trump’s sway over election outcomes, plus California’s drought and its impact on Victor’s farm in the San Joaquin Valley.<br /><br />ABOUT THE SERIES<br /><br />GoodFellows, a weekly Hoover Institution broadcast, features senior fellows John Cochrane, Niall Ferguson, and H.R. McMaster discussing the social, economic, and geostrategic ramifications of this changed world. They can’t banter over lunch these days, but they continue their spirited conversation online about what comes next, as we look forward to an end to the crisis. <br /><br />For more on this series visit, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hoover.org/goodfellows.">https://www.hoover.org/goodfellows.</a>{% endraw %}
