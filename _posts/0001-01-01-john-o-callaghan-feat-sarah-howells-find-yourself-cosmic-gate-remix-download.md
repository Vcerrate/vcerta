Timeless sounds and renewing tracks are what he captured on his second artist album 'Never Fade Away'. The 12-headed manifest of John's diverse sound, ranging from clean cut tech-trance to the silent surroundings of chill-out, received a more than warm welcome by the trance scene, and beyond.<br /><br />Though close to perfect in their original shape, some of the best trance producers did feel the need to re-work them and show the world their own vision on these beauties. Those interpretations have now been collected on the 'Never Fade Away Remixes' bundle. Remixes by Heatbeat, Matt Hardwick, Thomas Bronzwaer, Jon O'Bir, Marcus Schössow and more!<br /><br /><br /><br />Tracklist:<br /><br />1.
