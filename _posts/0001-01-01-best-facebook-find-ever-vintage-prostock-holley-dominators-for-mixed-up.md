{% raw %}So, a few weeks ago I began looking for a set of Holley Dominator Carbs for Project MIXED UP BOSS and I put a post in a Facebook group called Holley Carburetor buy, sell, trade discussion group. after a few days J.B. Wood posted a pic of these carbs and I sent him a message and I'm very fortunate to say he wanted to see them on my engine and gave me what I would call an outstanding deal. Thanks again J.B.  These carbs were originally built by a Holley rep for the Famous Motown Missile or Mopar Missile depending on the year.. they were never used or just used for testing...either way these carbs have been setting in a Time Capsule just waiting to be put on MIXED UP BOSS and will make big power once again!  Stay Tuned as I plan on doing a live chat of the rebuild of these carbs...<br />#holley #prostock #nonamenationals{% endraw %}
