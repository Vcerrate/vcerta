{% raw %}Enjoying the Yoru ultimate outplays before they are nerfing him :/ The new Yoru rework seems kinda weird, still split on how it's gonna turn out. Hope you enjoy the 200IQ yoru outplays &amp; flashes.<br /><br />Songs:<br />Good Kid - Tell me you know<br />Good Kid - Faster<br />Good Kid - Witches<br /><br />Watch EXCLUSIVE VIDEOS ðŸ¢‚ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ZipTie-100366285831587">https://www.facebook.com/ZipTie-100366285831587</a><br />Watch these clips LIVE ðŸ¢‚ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/hippostalker57">https://www.twitch.tv/hippostalker57</a><br />Follow my Twitter ðŸ¢‚ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Ziiptie">https://twitter.com/Ziiptie</a><br />Discord ðŸ¢‚ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/2jyzKfXPTT">https://discord.gg/2jyzKfXPTT</a><br />Business Email ðŸ¢‚ ziptiebusiness@gmail.com<br /><br />Road to 100k begins.<br />â€‹...<br />Crosshairs:<br />Main: 1-5-1-3<br />Dot: Size 3<br /><br />The latest Yoru buff in Valorant was honestly a pretty good one. It gives him the opportunity to perform some insane outplays, and just generally be more viable inside ranked queue. Add the buffs to the newest map Breeze and he honestly becomes an A-tier pick, when before he was hated by almost all. If you want to learn how to play Yoru, I post guides as often as I can, so hopefully, you enjoy those, I also post a lot of Yoru Outplay highlights/montages if that's also something you are interested in. Thanks for takin the time to read/watch, enjoy the rest of your day.<br /><br />COPYRIGHT<br />I do not own any songs used in this video, this video is meant for entertainment purposes only.{% endraw %}
