{% raw %}I've always wondered about how to live simply and cheaply -<br />And so, there were some things I decided to lose in order to gain my health, happiness, and life back.<br /><br />#livingsimply #frugalliving #simplelife<br /><br />üì∑ Credits to David Patterson for the wonderful shots in this video. <br />üèçÔ∏è Places featured in this video: Hillsborough Cafe and Din Cafe, Chiang Mai<br /><br />Follow The Wandering Elf<br /><br />‚òëÔ∏è Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SuzyTheWanderingElf/">https://www.facebook.com/SuzyTheWanderingElf/</a><br />‚òëÔ∏è Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/suzy_the_wandering_elf/">https://www.instagram.com/suzy_the_wandering_elf/</a><br />üìö Book Author <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Suzy-Parcero/e/B09M6YLVQP">https://www.amazon.com/Suzy-Parcero/e/B09M6YLVQP</a><br /><br />How To Live Simply And Cheaply <br /><br />In the past, I have lived quite frivolously - spending so much time, energy and money on things that I had very little to no need for. <br /><br />I accumulated so much clutter in my life - not just physical clutter but mental, emotional, and psychological clutter, as well. <br /><br />It is ironic because the more ‚Äústuff‚Äù I had, the more empty I felt. The only thing I had a lot of was stress, and I was often sick and depressed because of that vicious cycle of wanting more ‚Äústuff‚Äù, being careless with my finances, and battling with that nagging feeling that something‚Äôs missing in my life. <br /><br />So I decided to practice living simply and mindfully. I realize my life has more value and meaning when I  create instead of consume, minimize time spent on social media, and go out in nature and spend more time with loved ones <br /><br />These activities don‚Äôt cost a lot of money, either. A bike ride to a national park would cost us about $3 for fuel, a once-a-week trip to a cafe would cost us $2 per drink , and nature trips are pretty much free . <br /><br />As foreigners in this country, we do have additional expenses to take care of. However, we are able to minimize our expenses and stick to a minimal monthly budget for a family of 3 by living simply. We do eat out on special occasions and once a week But most of the time we make our own meals at home. That‚Äôs cheap, healthy, and delicious <br /><br />So not only was I living my life intentionally, but it was also inexpensive. In fact, I stopped buying 7 things, which I'll talk more about in the next video. And the return on investment is greater.<br /><br />I am happier, healthier overall, more content, and have less stress.<br /><br />When we live simply, we also live cheaply. We have fewer desires and more peace in our lives. <br /><br />As Thich Nhat Hanh says, ‚ÄúLet go, so that happiness, joy and peace can be possible.‚Äù <br /><br />Thank you for watching this video and I hope it adds value to your life. :){% endraw %}
