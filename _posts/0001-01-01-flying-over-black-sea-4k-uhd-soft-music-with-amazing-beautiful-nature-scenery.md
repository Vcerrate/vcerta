{% raw %}Welcome to Relaxing Nation !<br />The Black Sea is an inland sea between southeastern Europe and Anatolia that is actually a distant arm of the Atlantic Ocean by way of the Mediterranean Sea. It is connected to the Mediterranean by the Bosporus and the Sea of Marmara, and to the Sea of Azov by the Strait of Kerch. The Black Sea is supplied by major rivers, principally the Danube, Dnieper, and Don. Consequently, while six countries have a coastline on the sea itself, its drainage basin includes parts of 24 countries across Europe. The climate of the landlocked Black Sea can be characterized generally as continental, although climatic conditions in some parts of the basin are controlled to a great extent by the shoreline relief. A steppe climate, with cold winters and hot, dry summers, is found in the northwestern part of the basin exposed to the influence of air masses from the north.<br />In this video, I'm going to show you my favorite nature video about black sea or black sea in 4k videos, that will help you relax and improve your mood.
