{% raw %}Parks and Recreation: The Complete Series<br />Own it Now on DVD<br /><br />Subscribe to Our Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://uni.pictures/ytumsubscribe">http://uni.pictures/ytumsubscribe</a> <br /><br />Settle down in Pawnee, Indiana, with Golden Globe® winner Amy Poehler in Parks and Recreation:The Complete Series. Join small-town civil servant Leslie Knope (Poehler, Saturday Night Live) for every awkward strategy meeting, kooky idea and delicious bite of waffle as she strives to make City Hall a better place. By her side are her beloved—if quirky— colleagues: the deadpan Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman, The Lego Movie) (and his mustache!), apathetic April (Aubrey Plaza, The To Do List ), rockstar-in-his-own-mind Andy (Chris Pratt, Jurassic World), trendsetter Tom (Aziz Ansari, Buried Alive), best friend Ann (Rashida Jones, I Love You, Man), smart-mouthed Donna (Retta, Sex Ed), loyal Ben (Adam Scott, Hot Tub Time Machine 2) and the always energetic Chris (Rob Lowe, The West Wing). Oh, and Jerry (Jim O'Heir, Accepted)... or is it &quot;Larry&quot;? Featuring a deep bench of comedic talent and guest stars from the world of politics and sports alike, this seven-season set includes all 125 episodes of the smart, irreverent, heartfelt series from Primetime Emmy® Award-winning producers Greg Daniels (The Office, King of the Hill) and Michael Schur (The Office, Saturday Night Live). Enjoy every laugh from &quot;a show as rich and full as Ron Swanson's mustache&quot; (Anna Silman, Salon Magazine), back-to-back and uninterrupted!<br /><br />uni.pictures/ParksRecCS<br />Sign-up to receive updates, sneak peeks and offers here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://uni.pictures/emailyt">http://uni.pictures/emailyt</a> <br />The Universal Pictures All-Access channel is the place to be for all things about movies and behind-the-scenes.
