{% raw %}I know Atraks-1 only plays phase 2. Anyway, some will notice that a couple of Project Splintered videos don't have the ring, instead the bar. That's because I'm an idiot and didn't properly center a lot of my screenshots.<br /><br />Phase 1 - 0:00<br />Phase 2 - 4:03<br /><br />All rights belong to their respective owners. Music composed by Josh Mosser, Skye Lewin, and Michael Salvatori. I cannot provide downloads for these.{% endraw %}
