God causes all things to work together for good. It is a written or oral indication of a fact, opinion, or belief.<br /><br />I declare that the peace of God which is beyond human imagination is at work in me. <br />I am at peace in every situation, for Christ is my peace! <br />My life is the revelation of God's Word; His Mercy, knowledge, grace, power, wisdom and righteousness are unveiled in, and through me. <br />I am sensitive to the leading and guidance of the Spirit because my entire being is completely yielded to the Word of God. <br />Iâ€™m established by God's grace, in the path of greatness, and I live and walk in the reality of my inheritance in Christ. Hallelujah. <br />My dreams and ideas have expanded through God's Word, and I'm moving forward consistently by the power of the Holy Spirit! <br />My path is as a shining light, shining brighter and brighter unto the perfect day! <br />Every step I take is a step of expansion, prosperity, success and greatness. <br />I am complete in Christ; thereâ€™s nothing lacking in my life, because Christ is my completeness, and as He is, so am I in this world, In Christ Jesus I live, in Christ Jesus I move, in Christ Jesus I exist and have my being.
