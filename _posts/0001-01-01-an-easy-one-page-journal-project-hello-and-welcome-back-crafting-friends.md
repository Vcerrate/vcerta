{% raw %}Hello and welcome back crafting friends.  <br />Thank you so much for stopping by.  I hope you are all safe and sound.<br /><br />Today we are going to make a very easy one page pocket project.  You could use any type of paper, such as magazine pages, music paper, scrapbook pages, or anything else you have. We will use up some of our scraps.  You will be amazed how easy it is to make.<br />Come and follow along with me.  It's going to be a lot of fun.<br /><br />I have used my Spring Has Sprung journal collection, but you can use any paper or kits you have.<br /><br />I have a birthday sales offer on in my Etsy Shop until the end of 15 May 2022.
