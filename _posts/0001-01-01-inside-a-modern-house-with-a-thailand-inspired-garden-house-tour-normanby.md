{% raw %}Normanby House is a modern house which sees architects Pleysier Perkins embrace the dual nature of a Victorian building with a modern extension. Featuring fireplaces by Stoke Fireplace Studio, the modern house enables a luxurious residential experience. <br /><br />Settled into Melbourne’s bayside suburb of Brighton, Normanby House exudes a sense of grandeur, purposefully enhanced by architects Pleysier Perkins in reverence for the home’s original character. Elegant Victorian design features such as cornices and ceiling roses appear within the modern house, contrasting more modern elements such as a marble kitchen island.<br /><br />To the rear of the modern house, architecture firm Pleysier Perkins uses curves and stepstones to imbue the external landscape with personality. The design company utilises a robust material palette for the outdoor area, including concrete, timber and brickwork, to suggest the Thai inspiration for the garden landscaping. <br /><br />Elevating their interior design, architecture firm Pleysier Perkins employs two fireplaces by Stoke Fireplace Studio. The DF700 has pride of place in the sitting room, retrofitted into the existing fixture. In the living area, the MODE KS1150 Corner fireplace is seamlessly integrated into the architecture of the modern house. <br /><br />Adopting different styles of design – Victorian and modern - Pleysier Perkins creates a modern house that remains engaged with its architectural history. <br /><br />00:00 - The Inspiration for the Modern House<br />00:35 - Restoring Features of the Original House<br />01:03 - The Formal Front Garden <br />01:12 - The Thai Inspired Backyard Garden<br />01:41 - The Materials<br />02:12 - The Marble Island Bench<br />02:39 - Utilising Natural Light To Tell The Story<br />03:22 - Partnership with Stoke Fireplace Studio<br />04:30 - The Design Success<br />04:47 - What the Architect is Most Proud Of <br /><br />For more from The Local Project: <br /><br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/">https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/</a> <br />Website – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/</a> <br />Print Publication – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/</a> <br /><br />To subscribe to The Local Project's Tri-Annual Print Publication see here – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/</a> <br /><br />Architecture and Interior Design by Pleysier Perkins.<br />Photography by Tom Blachford.<br />Furniture and Styling by George Marks Design.<br />Build by TCON.<br />Landscape Architecture by Eckersley Garden Architecture.<br />Filmed and Edited by Cheer Squad Film Co.<br />Production by The Local Project.<br /><br />Musicbed SyncID: MB01SXERAOYPYCA<br /><br />#ModernHouse #Architecture #HouseTour #Garden #InteriorDesign #Landscape #Landscaping  #TheLocalProject #House #Home #Architect #InteriorDesigner #Fireplace #Concrete{% endraw %}
