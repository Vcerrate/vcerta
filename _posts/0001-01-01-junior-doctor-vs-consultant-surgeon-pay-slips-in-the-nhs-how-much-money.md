{% raw %}CORRECTION: At 11:30 I discuss &quot;additional pay&quot; for consultants being for being an educational or clinical supervisor only but it actually is for MANY extra roles this consultant has. This includes things like being clinical director, medical director, surgical lead, educational lead, clinical tutor etc. Essentially, this category of pay represents the additional hours for many roles not just one. <br /><br />Hi guys, I'm back today with an important video because I think we should talk more openly about our money for transparency and good financial health! What to expect financially from a career in medicine in the NHS? What is the salary progression for doctors? How much do I earn? Answer to all of these questions and many more in this video!! 💸  <br /><br />⏰ Time stamps: <br />00:00 Intro<br />00:27 Why am I making this video?<br />02:08 My junior doctor pay cheque<br />02:37 Junior doctor salary progression <br />07:57 Junior doctor final take home salary <br />08:58 Consultant surgeon pay cheque <br />09:20 Consultant salary progression <br />13:50 Consultant surgeon final take home salary <br />14:08 Additional income and outgoings <br /><br />About me:<br />My name is Surina Taneja and I am a junior doctor who trained in the UK.
