{% raw %}The transport sector contributes 25 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions and it is one of the fastest growing sectors, especially in developing countries. Successful decarbonisation of the economy would thus need to consider decarbonising the transport sector. The signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, which has the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) at its core, has also led to the development of national pathways that will help guide countries achieve their climate targets.<br /><br />This is an opportunity to increase ambitions and strengthen transport climate actions, yet aviation is not included in the Paris Agreement. This webinar will provide an overview of transport demand growth and subsequent carbon dioxide emissions for both passenger and freight transport, with a special focus on aviation transport. It will also highlight effective policy actions that need to be implemented in order to decarbonise the sector.<br /><br />Speakers:<br />Wei-Shiuen Ng is Advisor of Sustainable Transport and Global Outreach in the International Transport Forum (ITF) at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). She is also an Adjunct Professor in the Paris School of International Affairs at the Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po). Her expertise includes transport emissions, energy and behavioral modeling, sustainable development, and climate change policy analysis. Prior to joining the ITF, Wei-Shiuen was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Precourt Energy Efficiency Center at Stanford University. She holds a Ph.D. in City and Regional Planning from the University of California, Berkeley, a Masters in Environmental Science from Yale University and a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Economics and Environmental Management from the University of York.<br /><br />Dr Antigoni Lykotrafiti is a Lecturer in Transport, Energy and the Law at the Centre for Commercial Law Studies, Queen Mary University of London.<br /><br />Steve Newbury is an innovation leader, currently responsible for academic research supporting the ATIâ€™s FlyZero programme which is taking a holistic look at zero carbon aviation.{% endraw %}
