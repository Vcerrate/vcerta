I learned how to write syllabus and create structured improvement in the lives of my clients, before applying my knowledge of applied behavioral change to neuro-typical Men. <br /><br />By the age of 23, I was in high demand and had worked with many of the world's top Dating Coaching companies. I soon realized that talking to girls in the daytime had greater benefits to the individual than dates and relationships with amazing women, but on a personal level it could be integrated mindfully in to anyone's daily lifestyle, to increase their confidence, social skills, self-esteem, and energy levels.<br /><br />Now I work with high-achievers all over the globe, coaching them to have A) the dating life of their dreams, and B) a solid tribe of guys to motivate, support, and push them forward, whilst remaining mindful in balancing their health + finances with new-found social freedom!<br /><br />I created Fluid Social with the mission to teach the ambitious men how to meet their ideal women and form unshakeable networks. <br /><br />So book a free coaching call (if you dare...) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://calendly.com/fluidsocial/conn...">https://calendly.com/fluidsocial/conn...</a>{% endraw %}
