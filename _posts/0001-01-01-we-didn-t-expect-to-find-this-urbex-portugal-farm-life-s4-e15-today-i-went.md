{% raw %}Today I went on a bit of an adventure and tried our hand at some URBEX (Urban Exploration). Its been about a year since I went up the Serra da Gardunha, which is a large mountain range just behind our farm. These beautiful mountains are 20 milometers in length and 10 kilometres wide and are located in the Beira Baixa region of Central Portugal.<br /><br />Its spring time and the mountain is looking absolutely incredible. All of the flowers are out in full force and the views from up top are spectacular. What I didn't expect to find were these old abandoned homes and buildings, which were damaged in the great fires of 2017. I found a route in and went for a spot of urban exploration (urbex) to have a look inside these buildings on abandoned land, and uncover their secrets. I also found the BaloiÃ§o do Castelo Velho, which is an old wooden swing chair perched up high in the mountain, with far reaching views of the surrounding land and the Marateca dam. I also managed to spot our farm from way up there!<br /><br />We are Ken &amp; Gina, and we left the UK in 2019 in search of a simpler life, away from our office jobs, and the hustle and bustle of the big city. We sold our house, left the UK, and left the Rat race behind us, to move to Portugal and buy a farm. We found an amazing farm in Castelo Branco, Central Portugal where we have lived for the last two and a half years. We make these videos for our friends and family to keep up with whatâ€™s going on in our new lives and as a record to look back on one day so see how far we have come. We are always amazed when we see how many people have been watching, following, and subscribing to our vlogs.
