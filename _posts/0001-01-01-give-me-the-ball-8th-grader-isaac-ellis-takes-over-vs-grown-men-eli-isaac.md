{% raw %}Episode 7 of FAMILY BUSINESS with the Ellis Brothers! We're coming off the fight with So Cal and the squad needs to bounce back. They get a surprise call from Overtime inviting them to come play at OTE! <br /><br />Isaac and Eli are hyped to go down to Atlanta for the game but first, they gotta play a warmup. They BROKE THE RECORD for threes in a game... crazy. Now they're heading to OTE for their hardest game of the year. <br /><br />Isaac and Eli were blown away when they got to ATL. Seeing the facilities and all the players was nuts, but they're ready to go. They're playing Team Overtime who has multiple guys who will play in the NBA real soon.<br /><br />Moravian starts off a bit slow, but they're keeping it close. Coach Ellis keeps pushing them to play harder but it's not working. In the third quarter, Team Overtime opens it up and takes like a 20 point lead.<br /><br />Moravian can either break down and get crushed, or turn up. 8th Grader Isaac Ellis makes the call, GIVE HIM THE BALL. Isaac gets hot and hits a few threes to lead the comeback, but will it be enough? <br /><br />Love y'all hope you guys are enjoying the show<br />---------------------------------<br />Follow Us...
