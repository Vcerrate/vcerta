This in turn led to permanent settlements and the rise of civilizations.  <br /><br />The problem with this characterization n of human evolution is what our Ancestors were actually accomplishing during early neolithic times, and it went far, far beyond what we are told Humanity was capable of. <br /><br />This a re-make of a video I uploaded back in 2019, and in which I included additional information.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/michellegibson">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/michellegibson</a><br />Patreon:  www.patreon.com/PiercingtheVeilofIllusion<br />UnGuru:  www.unguruyourlife.com<br /><br />My eBooks:<br /><br />Physical Evidence for the Planetary Grid System &amp; the Suppressed Moorish Worldwide Civilization -<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buythisbooktoday.com/published-authors-ebooks/4qgtr674zau0jyg1s0qpm4hcaehxfj">https://www.buythisbooktoday.com/published-authors-ebooks/4qgtr674zau0jyg1s0qpm4hcaehxfj</a><br /><br />Transportation &amp; Other Infrastructure of the Planetary Grid System -<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buythisbooktoday.com/published-authors-ebooks/7quzl57p9vrkh3y1v0wpxeuz1qy9rk">https://www.buythisbooktoday.com/published-authors-ebooks/7quzl57p9vrkh3y1v0wpxeuz1qy9rk</a>{% endraw %}
