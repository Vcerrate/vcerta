{% raw %}Don Ready (Jeremy's hero) as a real salesman sells to the stewardess his right to smoke in the plane.<br /><br />Here is the text:<br /><br />-Sir, there's no smoking on airplanes.<br />-I know. It's ridiculous, isn't it?Don't worry about it, I'll be quick.<br />-Sir, if you light that, I'll have to report you to the FAA.<br />-Stacey, do you know when the first commercial flight went smokeless?<br />- No.<br />- 1973.<br />-And did you know that in 1969, when smoking was allowed on all flights, we put a man on the moon?<br />- I had no idea.<br />-Look. You know what that is? That's a remnant of a better time, but they welded it shut.<br />And it starts with ashtrays, and it ends with all of our precious freedoms being stripped away.<br />I remember back in the day  when you got on a plane and you knew you were in for a good time.<br />-A little smoking, a little drinking. <br /> Yeah. And the stewardesses.-Stacey, you come from a proud tradition of blazing hot stewardesses.<br />And now you can't do one damn thing without someone reporting you to the Department of Homeland Security.  <br />Am I right?<br />- That's right.<br />- You listen to Don.<br />- I had to take my pants off  and nibble my Old Spice down to three ounces  just to get on the plane, Stacey.<br />-They made me throw out my mouthwash.<br />-I had to give up my bath jellies.<br />-They made me breastfeed some old man.<br />-That's what I'm talking about. But we don't have to take it, Stacey.<br />Like Henry David Thoreau and Rosa Parks  and David Lee Roth when he left Van Halen,<br />we can say, &quot;Enough. Enough injustice.&quot;<br /><br />And when you and I are old and gray,  we can look back on this and remember when we were  30,000 feet above God's green earth, and we smoked one,  we smoked one for America.<br />  <br />-Yeah.<br /> <br />-You motherfucker.<br />  <br />-Nice work. Nice work.<br />  -Who are you?<br />  -I'm Don Ready, and I got the goods.<br />- This is some killer kush.<br />-Nun pops her head out and says, &quot;Shit. Guess I got to gargle.&quot;{% endraw %}
