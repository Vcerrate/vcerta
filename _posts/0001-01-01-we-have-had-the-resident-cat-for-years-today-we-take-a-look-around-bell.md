{% raw %}Today we take a look around Bell Green Sector Police Station, Coventry.<br /><br />There is not much to see at all as this is a Portacabin and a Car Park but we do see a Van leaving on a job, we meet the resident cat and report a few findings to a PC.<br /><br />It was also great to see that the intercom outside provides the community with direct communication to the control room.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br />_________________________________<br />Q - What is your email address?<br />A - djaudits@gmail.com<br /><br />Q - What Drone Do I Use<br />A - DJI MINI 2 <br />Can be purchased here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ICW9Dp">https://amzn.to/3ICW9Dp</a><br /><br />Q - What Camera Do I Use<br />A - DJI OSMO POCKET 2<br />Can be purchased here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/30bEMs4">https://amzn.to/30bEMs4</a>{% endraw %}
