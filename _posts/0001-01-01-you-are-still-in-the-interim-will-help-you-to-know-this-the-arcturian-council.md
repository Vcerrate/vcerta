{% raw %}As always, set an intention to receive these words through your heart space. Love you my friends💖 Transcript below <br /><br />The Arcturians: <br />You are still in the interim, where the force that moves in the opposite direction of your will (the natural balancing of energy, applying an equal and opposite pull) is creating an illusion that you are farther from “the finish line” than you actually are.  <br /><br />Imagine you are running a long distance marathon… but you are only competing with yourself. And you are almost to the destination, but you can’t see it. It is just on the other side of a hill, or just around a bend. Because you are exhausted, you feel a resistance within you (creating a push pull effect)… <br /><br />Imagine if you just gave up and sat down by the side of the road, and even called for a ride to come and get you to take you back toward your home. <br />This creates the illusion that you have somehow lost the race, or perhaps missed your destination… <br /><br />Whereas, if you continue to move slowly and stay connected to the original image (which was your creation… your individual and collective dream… your next big beautiful goal)… you will eventually make it around that bend.  You will eventually begin to see evidence of what is to come... Maybe it starts with a little sun, a tree, and then a little shop. And then people are coming out of the shop and you realize it’s actually the town… the destination.  Imagine the breath you take, the relief you feel. [Painting a picture for us here]<br /><br />Take that breath now.  If you can’t run right now, walk… If you can’t walk right now, then perhaps rest for a moment… and then when you feel rested, put one foot slowly in front of the other. <br /><br />Keep bringing your heart back into focus… back to the forefront.  <br /><br />You do not have to pretend nothing else exists, but at a certain point it is necessary to ignore everything around you that does not apply to your vision.  You can do this compassionately… You can do this thoughtfully, appreciating that something may momentarily need you… <br /><br />But if you stay attuned to your heart’s direction, you will still reach your next destination.  <br /><br />We are the Arcturian Council. We love you! <br />End transmission. <br /><br />Timestamps: <br />0:00 Intro<br />0:34 There is an illusion being created that you are farther from the finish line than you really are<br />1:23 Imagine you are sunning a marathon...
