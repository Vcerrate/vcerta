{% raw %}► What Historical Figures Might Look Like If They Lived Today<br />► Hello everyone and welcome back to Mystery Scoop. An artist uses AI tools to create a modern version of historical figures.<br /><br />Have you ever wondered what historical figures might look like if they lived today? Well, a digital artist named Hidreley Diao, from Brazil, had a similar question and he used modern AI tools to figure it out. He created a realistic depiction of some of history's most iconic figures, capturing their main facial characteristics, while keeping in mind that if they lived in this day and age, modern lifestyle would have created a slightly twisted version of them. Let's have a look at a few amazing examples of his work, bringing historical figures to life, with a little AI animation thrown in the mix.<br /><br />Please check the video to see historical figures AI recreated as modern people today.
