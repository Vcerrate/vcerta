{% raw %}Are your reps really connected with their most important customers? How many of your important customers are you just “one car wreck” away from losing because your sales rep only has one real contact/connection at their account. But if that single-contact buyer is promoted, fired, or just not there anymore, and that’s your only contact, then you likely lose all account momentum and loyalty. Join me as I share ideas to get your team higher, wider, and deeper into all their important accounts, so you can sell even more!{% endraw %}
