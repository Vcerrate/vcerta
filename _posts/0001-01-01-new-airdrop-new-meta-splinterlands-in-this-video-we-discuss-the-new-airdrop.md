{% raw %}In this video we discuss the new airdrop announcement, and how great it might be. Not only does it look like an excellent card, but I really believe it will work extremely well with the New Chaos Legion meta, particularly the Earth Splinter. <br /><br />Not only is it another powerful magic monster, which adds to the value of Obsidian, but its also an low mana option, making it functional in a most matches. On top of that, it synergizes so well with the existing play style of Earth, in ways we will dive into here today. <br /><br />As always, thank you for your time and attention, have an amazing day and God bless.<br /><br />Join the Channel!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOoOxEybRJm_iK7EtL11YNw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOoOxEybRJm_iK7EtL11YNw/join</a><br /><br />TNA Discord:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/timeandattention">https://discord.gg/timeandattention</a><br /><br />Sign-up for Splinterlands!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://splinterlands.com?ref=infidel1258">https://splinterlands.com?ref=infidel1258</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TimeNattention">https://twitter.com/TimeNattention</a><br />Ethereum: 0x9e805A40E5d4C831b63d94E2603b5E3F436C0250<br />Bitcoin: bc1qk0v6n7uyr75fg528xew58ddqdy7k5tf2w7a0zk<br />XRP: r4sThPjjPRPnzTgARFEwmS2KC6ua9sD8Qd{% endraw %}
