{% raw %}#Ducati#StreetFighter#V2<br /><br />Ducati’s new £14,995 Streetfighter is a naked Panigale V2 with virtually nothing taken away…except for the fairing. And that’s a very good thing because Bologna’s ‘baby’ superbikes have always had a sublime balance of power and handling - a bit like Suzuki’s old GSX-R750.<br /><br />The Ducati Streetfighter V2 follows in the footsteps of its V4 sister - a lary, high tech tour de force with a 205bhp MotoGP-derived engine, but that’s also a bike that operates at such an otherworldly level it only makes sense on track. This is where the smaller version comes in.<br /><br />We'd love to hear your views so get them down in the comment section.<br /><br />Check us out on socials:<br /><br />Facebook: @MotorcycleNews<br />Twitter: @MCNnews MCNSport<br />Instagram: @motorcyclenews<br /><br />Visit the MCN website for all the latest news, reviews, advice and bikes for sale: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.motorcyclenews.com/​​">https://www.motorcyclenews.com/​​</a><br /><br />MCN Compare is your one-stop bike insurance shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mcncompare.com/">https://www.mcncompare.com/</a><br /><br /><br />Subscribe to get MCN every week, in newspaper or digital format: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3rEIjaP">https://bit.ly/3rEIjaP</a> <br /><br />Follow us!<br />Facebook<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MotorcycleNews/">https://www.facebook.com/MotorcycleNews/</a> <br /><br />Twitter News and Sport<br />@MCNNews <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MCNnews">https://twitter.com/MCNnews</a> <br />@MCNSport <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MCNSport">https://twitter.com/MCNSport</a> <br /><br />Instagram<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/motorcyclenews/">https://www.instagram.com/motorcyclenews/</a> <br /><br />Visit the MCN website for all the latest news, reviews, advice and bikes for sale: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.motorcyclenews.com/">https://www.motorcyclenews.com/</a><br /><br />MCN Compare is your one-stop bike insurance shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mcncompare.com/">https://www.mcncompare.com/</a>{% endraw %}
