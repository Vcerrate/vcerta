{% raw %}Vaccines are essential to protect our children and communities, especially during the spike of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. What to Expect creator Heidi Murkoff spoke to US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy about the benefits of vaccination for pregnant people, children, family members and those who are trying to get pregnant.<br /><br />00:00 Introductions<br />01:45 What Masks to Wear<br />08:02 Vaccines and Fertility<br />12:42 When to Get Vaccinated<br />15:34 Antibodies From Mom to Baby<br />17:57 Breastfeeding and COVID<br />18:48 Higher Risks During Pregnancy<br />20:04 Protecting Your Newborn<br />23:50 Grandparents and Newborns<br />25:45 Vaccinating Your Older Children<br />32:44 Omicron and Children<br />36:15 Vaccine Approval for Younger Children<br />39:35 Closing Remarks<br />43:23 Hugs<br /><br />Learn more about vaccines during pregnancy at WhatToExpect.com: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.whattoexpect.com/news/pregnancy/covid19-vaccine-pregnancy-children">https://www.whattoexpect.com/news/pregnancy/covid19-vaccine-pregnancy-children</a><br /><br />Download the What to Expect app: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pregnancy-baby-what-to-expect/id289560144">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pregnancy-baby-what-to-expect/id289560144</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wte.view">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wte.view</a><br /><br />Heidi Murkoff, creator of What to Expect, is here to guide you through every stage of your baby's life.

The data points show that the vaccines are safe during these various stages before and during pregnancy.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;They found generally that anytime during your pregnancy is actually fine [to get the vaccine], and that's why the recommendation is just to get it,&quot; explains Dr. Murthy. &quot;Ideally, [you should be vaccinated] as soon as possible because if you get COVID-19 during pregnancy, you are at greater risk for worse outcomes and so is your baby. Getting the protection started early is really important, and this is not just true for COVID-19 vaccines, but for the flu vaccine as well.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;If you get boosted, it significantly raises your protection,&quot; Dr. Murthy says. &quot;In fact, a recent [CDC] study showed that people who are boosted have 90 percent protection against hospitalization and 82 percent protection against visits to the emergency room or urgent care. That's pretty good as far as vaccines go, but that's why that booster is so important.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;If you’re in your own home, with your family, those are not circumstances that require you to wear a mask,&quot; Dr. Murthy says. &quot;If you are outside, let’s say taking a walk or at the park, you also don’t necessarily need to wear a mask. You may want to consider it in an outdoor setting if you’re in crowded quarters for a prolonged period of time. The places that you need masks are in indoor settings. Then the question becomes, 'What kind of mask should I wear?'&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Here’s where Omicron has shifted things a bit in terms of the importance of wearing a high-quality mask. First, it’s important to recognize that a mask is better than no mask at all. A well-fitted cloth mask will give you some level of protection in an indoor setting. You can increase your level of protection by wearing a surgical mask, and a step above that would be a KN95 mask or a KF94. Masking does two things: It helps prevent infection from traveling from you to someone else, and a good-quality mask can also help protect you from infection that may spread from other people. If you’re in a higher-risk category, it’s important to reach for those higher-quality masks.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We looked at clinical trial data and found ... about 90 percent protection from the COVID-19 vaccine for kids in the 5 to 11 age category,&quot; says Dr. Murthy.<br /><br />&quot;That’s pretty good as far as vaccines go because you don’t always get that high level of protection. But the other thing that we saw was a safety profile. In fact, the common side effect that kids tended to receive was a sore arm at the site of the injection. Other symptoms could include a low-grade fever, body aches and headaches, but those lasted typically one to two days.” <br /><br />&quot;This has been the subject of a lot of questions and conversations with people, and some of it, unfortunately, stems from some rumors and misinformation circulating on the Internet,&quot; Dr. Murthy says. &quot;The bottom line is that there is no evidence that the vaccines cause fertility problems or problems during or after pregnancy.&quot;{% endraw %}
