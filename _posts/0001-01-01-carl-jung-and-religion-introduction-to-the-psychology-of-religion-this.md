{% raw %}This video is based on Volumes 7, 8, 9i, 10, and 11 of the collected works of Carl Jung<br /><br />In this video we discuss the psychology of religion from a Jungian perspective. Jung believed that religion was quite valuable for our psychological health and endeavoured to study the connection between the psyche and religious experiences. We specifically discuss how religion interacts with the unconscious, how religious systems provide a sense of psychological stability, and the consequences of abandoning religion.<br /><br />Please see the following videos for more information:<br /><br />Reality of the Psyche: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbSBqpICAnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbSBqpICAnw</a><br /><br />Origins and History of Consciousness: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LnUi1aniHY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LnUi1aniHY</a><br /><br />Jesus as a Symbol of the Self: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qdq1L9QYts">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qdq1L9QYts</a>{% endraw %}
