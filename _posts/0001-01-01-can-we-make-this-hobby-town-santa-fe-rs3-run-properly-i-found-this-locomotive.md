{% raw %}I found this locomotive in a junk bin at a train store several months ago. It looked to be a decent locomotive and was also fitted with DCC so I asked what they wanted for it and they said $35 so I decided to buy it. It did run to some extent but not well and and would loose power randomly so it was clear it needed work to run properly. Today I attempt to fix it.<br /><br />Fiberglass pencil: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VeB6CU">https://amzn.to/2VeB6CU</a> (affiliate) USA{% endraw %}
