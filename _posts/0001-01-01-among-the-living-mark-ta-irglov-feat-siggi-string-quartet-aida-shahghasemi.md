{% raw %}Among the living is a long and rich song by Marketa Irglova, written and composed during a special time in human history, when a pandemic swept across the globe. The song is dedicated to the millions of people that have suffered from loneliness, sickness, loss and grief. Director Anni Ólafsdóttir has long been fascinated by the term Tarantism: &quot;To overcome melancholy with the uncontrollable urge to dance.&quot; Marketa had already spoken to two dancers, Ale a gaga dancer from Paraguay and Yannier a classical ballet dancer born in Cuba, living in Iceland. Anni had a favourite contemporary dancer from Latvia, Klāvs Liepiņš that added the third element of dance and movement art to the piece. <br /><br />Each dancer created his own response to the song and then they rehearsed together to synchronise their emotions and know each others movements. The song is an emotional journey almost 15 minutes, so the challenge is to make a short film, that keeps the arch of emotion, loss, love, and hope so the audience looses track of time. The story is open for anyone to interpret in his own way and Markéta’s text gives some guidance as well. We have elements of religion and grace, elements of despair, of being lonely among others, elements of water, symbols of the steps of grief and some symbols of hope. The characters are stuck in certain spaces but the movements show us that despite everything, hardship and grief does pass. Just like a dancer turns, the world keeps on turning and life continues and makes room for your next steps. This take on tarantism: to overcome melancholy through an uncontrollable urge to dance - will hopefully reach those that need it - inspire, maybe help and heal.<br /><br /><br />Director:                         Anni Ólafsdóttir<br />Co-director:                   Andri Snær Magnason<br />                                            <br />Producer:                      Andri Snær Magnason<br />Producers on set:        Hanna Björk Valsdóttir &amp; Sturla Míó Þórisson<br /> <br />Executive Producers:  Markéta Irglová &amp; Sturla Míó Þórisson<br /><br />Performers<br /> <br />Dancers:                        Ale Jara<br />(In order of                    Yannier Oviedo<br />appearance)                 Klavs Liepins<br />                                    <br /> <br />Singer:                           Markéta Irglová<br />Church Organ:              Björn Steinar Sólbergsson<br />1st Violin:                      Una Sveinbjarnadóttir<br />2nd Violin:                     Helga Þóra Björgvinsdóttir<br />Viola:                              Þórunn Ósk Marínósdóttir<br />Cello:                              Sigurður Gunnarsson<br /><br />Crew<br /> <br />Director of Photography:   Anton Smári Gunnarsson <br />Focus Pullers:                      Hjálmar Þór Hjálmarsson<br />                                               Róbert Magnússon<br />2nd AC :                                Rúnar Vilberg Hjaltason<br />DIT:                                        Eva Lind Höskuldsdóttir<br /> <br />Gaffer:                                   Halldór Kristinsson<br />Best Boy:                              Bjarki Heimisson<br /> <br />Key Grip:                              Tómas Freyr Jóhannsson<br />Speciality Rig &amp; Drone:      Gunnar Steinn<br /> <br />Editors:                                 Anni Ólafsdóttir<br />                                               Eva Lind Höskuldsdóttir<br />Color Grading:                     Bjarki Guðjónsson at Trickshot<br /> <br />Production Designers:      Dröfn Ösp Snorradóttir<br />                                              Johnny Rozas<br /> <br />Costume Designer:           Ellen Loftsdóttir<br />Costume Assistant:          Arna Engilbertsdóttir<br />Make-Up Artist:                 Flora Buenano<br />Graphic Design:                Helsinki Studio<br /><br />Music<br /> <br />Written by:                          Markéta Irglová<br />Produced by:                      Sturla Mio Thorisson<br />Performed by:                    Markéta Irglová<br />                                             Siggi String Quartet<br />                                             Aida Shahghasemi<br /> <br />Recorded, mixed &amp; mastered by:<br />Sturla Mio Thorisson<br />at Masterkey Studios 2021<br /> <br /> <br />Extras:   <br /><br />Guðmundur Eiríksson<br />Elín Guðmundsdóttir<br />Einar Ólafsson<br />Guðrún Helga Jónasdóttir<br />Anna María Bogadóttir<br />Gunnlaugur Friðriksson<br /><br /><br /><br />Special Thanks:                 <br /><br />Kukl<br />Trickshot<br />Hótel Saga<br />Ingibjörg Ólafsdóttir<br />Birgir Örn Brynjólfsson<br />Kiley Rene Larson<br />Sigtryggur Ari Jóhannesson<br />Hrönn Egilsdóttir<br />Sigríður Hjálmarsdóttir<br />Hallgrímskirkja<br />Hrafnkell Sigurðsson<br />Ámundi Sigurðsson<br />Pajonka<br />Swimslow<br />Spuutnik<br />Vilborg Árný Valgarðsdóttir<br />Berglind Jóhannesdóttir<br />Šárka Veronika<br />Cat Gundry-Beck<br />Freyr Karel Branolte<br />Sigurður Þór Helgason DJI Iceland{% endraw %}
