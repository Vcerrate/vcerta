{% raw %}This relaxing music is based upon the neural entrainment phenomenon. Our brains tend to synchronize to external stimulation, including auditory, visual, tactile, or electromagnetic stimuli. The human brain has an average of 86 billion neurons that communicate to form our thoughts, emotions, and behavior. When our neurons communicate en masse, it produces a synchronized electrical pulse known as a brainwave. With neural entrainment, our brainwaves can align to this auditory stimulation. As a result, we can stimulate our neurons and induce brainwaves in ways that could positively affect our psychology and physiology.
