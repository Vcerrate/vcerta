The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving. One letter from each category is taken to produce a four-letter test result, like INTP or INFP. It is sometimes used as pre employment test or pre hire assessment and it could influence your career and job decisions.{% endraw %}
