{% raw %}Arkosh Kovash is minor character from &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (1995).<br />He is the lone survivor from a Hungarian mob who were killed in a gang incident the previous night. After waking up from a coma with multiple broken ribs and burns over most of his body, Kovash claims he saw Keyser Söze (Keyser Söze!!) during the incident and is now the only living person who can positively identify him. But he can't speak English, only Hungarian.<br /><br />I wanted to know what he said in the movie, so some helpful people on Reddit helped me translate it from Hungarian to English. The translations may not be 100% accurate, but the essence of the meaning is there. I welcome any corrections in the comments.<br /><br />What he says in the movie lines up with the story pretty well. There were things he definitely didn't say that the interpreter in the movie translated, but 99.9% of the audience probably don't understand Hungarian, so this was overlooked.<br /><br />Arkosh Kovash is played by Morgan Hunter<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0402974/?ref_=tt_ch">https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0402974/?ref_=tt_ch</a><br /><br />Fun fact: The name &quot;Arkosh Kovash&quot; (spelled &quot;Ákos Kovács&quot; in Hungarian) is actually quite common: something like the Hungarian equivalent of &quot;John Smith.&quot;<br /><br />*Spoiler alert!* Verbal Kint is actually Keyser Söze. The police facial composite sketch from Kovash's description correlates with this.<br /><br />Sources:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hungarian/comments/l6fb3w/id_like_to_know_what_the_hungarian_mobster_in_the/">https://www.reddit.com/r/hungarian/comments/l6fb3w/id_like_to_know_what_the_hungarian_mobster_in_the/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://web.stanford.edu/~landy/UsualSuspectsHungarian.html#:~:text=Arkosh%20Kovash%3A%20%E2%80%A6%20that%20I%20live,t%20understand%E2%80%A6%20he%20kills%20everyone">https://web.stanford.edu/~landy/UsualSuspectsHungarian.html#:~:text=Arkosh%20Kovash%3A%20%E2%80%A6%20that%20I%20live,t%20understand%E2%80%A6%20he%20kills%20everyone</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114814/characters/nm0402974">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114814/characters/nm0402974</a><br /><br />Copyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.{% endraw %}
