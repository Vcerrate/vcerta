The label and events will complement each other with one aim; to bring the crowd into another dimension of music perception with enthralling production to that ignite the senses.<br />The ‘Realm Of Consciousness’ voyage commences with Tale Of Us’ Lies - a fitting introduction with quivering keys and restrained percussion that engenders an ominous suspense ahead of Monoloc’s enigmatic industrial techno crunch, Phoenix. Shifting through the haunting chords of Recondite’s dynamic Murphy’s Law, to the brooding synth of Poseidon by Ukrainian duo Woo York, the realisation of Afterlife utopia is upon us. The repetitive, mesmerising synth and effective reverb that Somne creates with Triangle is an odyssey within itself. From there, Jon Hester’s expertly woven ‘Logan’ is a feverish techno stab that transverses through the emotional senses, transitioning to Locked Groove’s adroitly crafted Emeralds, to Ryan James Ford’s ambient, albeit percussive, techno cut Toree Bahrstad. Die Wiederkehr is the outcome of Obscure Shape &amp; SHDW’s collaboration, which incorporates facets of techno and trance that have been shaped with real guile and finesse. Mind Against round off the compilation with Gravity - a mystifying ambience and a fitting title as we touch back down to planet earth.<br /><br />Tracklist<br />1. Tale Of Us - Lies<br />2.
