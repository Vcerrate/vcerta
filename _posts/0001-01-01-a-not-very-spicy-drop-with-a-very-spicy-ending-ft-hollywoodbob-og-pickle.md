{% raw %}Some people have a lot of things up their sleeves, dear viewer, and some other very special people have a lot of things in their magic sack. One of those very special people is The chocolate Tacolate. That's right: it's another tactical pactical game, this time in squads, and choco is here to continue his very convincing message that this new magic sack is ridiculously over-powered. He's like a Doomsday Santa, dealing death and destruction to all those unfortunate enough to cross his path. It's good entertainment, though, so I hope you came prepared to enjoy!  - Beth<br /><br />See choco stream LIVE at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/chocotaco">http://www.twitch.tv/chocotaco</a><br />You can follow his Twitter here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/chocoTaco">https://twitter.com/chocoTaco</a><br /><br />Music: &quot;DuDa&quot; by Ian Post, from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artlist.io/">https://artlist.io/</a><br /><br />Keywords: PUBG gameplay, chocoTaco, #chocoTaco #PUBG #HollywoodBob{% endraw %}
