{% raw %}It is time, to explore the most broken set bonus in 9.2! The Protection Warrior Shield Slam one.<br /><br />Special thanks to all my Patreon supporters, appreciate you all! <br /><br />Deathness - BleedingHollow (US Servers)<br />Icorian - Frostmane (EU Servers) <br />Kiteflyer - Elune (US Servers) <br />Tailsnapper - GrimBatol (EU Servers) <br />Arrazy - Stormscale (EU Servers) <br />Lightfang - Elune (US Servers) <br />Archâon - Moonguard (US Servers) <br />Jakmage - Ragnaros (EU Servers) <br />Aegîs - Ravencrest (EU Servers) <br />Plantagenant - Bladefist (US Servers) <br />Héliejah - Elune (EU Servers) <br />Ecoplex - EmeraldDream (US Servers) <br />Sankir - EmeraldDream (US Servers) <br />Darthmarva - Blackmoore (EU Servers) <br />Elyora - BurningBlade(EU Servers) <br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/rextroy">https://www.patreon.com/rextroy</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/rextroy3​​​">https://twitter.com/rextroy3​​​</a> <br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/rextroy​​​">https://www.twitch.tv/rextroy​​​</a><br /><br />Special thanks to Lillekatta, the best thumbnail maker!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Lillekatta​​​">https://twitter.com/Lillekatta​​​</a><br /><br />Background:<br />This combo is really simple, and it works in Arena! The hardest thing to obtain is the set bonus itself...<br /><br />We have A LOT of damage modifers for this... here is a list:<br />20% from the talent Punish<br />30% from Shield Block<br />30% from Avatar<br />15% from mastery benefits (conqueror's banner and fleshcraft passive)<br />25% from strength modifers (Fireblood and Badge Trinket)<br />20% additional strength from Veteran's repute<br />12% from Plaguey (soulbind)<br />6% from Kevin (soulbind)<br />200% from set bonus!<br />20% from Booming Voice talent<br />75% (if you crit) crit chance is boosted by Sword and Board PvP talent<br /><br />I also tried out both Sephul's Proclamation for stats, and the Signet of Tormented Kings (20% crit if you are able to proc Recklessness)<br /><br />The whole combo is just to use everything, including Fastidious Resolve (the PvP trinket that makes you avoid 2 incoming CC effects), you charge the enemy and use Demoralizing shout, followed by a Shield Slam!<br /><br />If it crits, it will most likely kill the enemy if it doesn't have defensives active... a non crit does between 50-70% of their health!<br /><br />I also tried to change the combo a bit and went Night Fae. To do an Ancient Aftershock followed by a Shield Slam... This combo is more reliable crit wise, since you spread the damage over 2 spells instead! You also get access to First Strike for 25% damage boost.<br /><br />We had a really weird bug happen when a podtender got killed, and the person ressed instantly. I believe it was a bug with the timing of Guardian Angel, just as the Podtender died... However Guardian Angel didn't get used up, so it is suspicious...<br />It happened at 7:26<br /><br />Music:<br /><br />World of Warcraft OST.<br />Composers: Jason Hayes, Tracy W.
