{% raw %}ANU Centre for European Studies’ Dr Sonia Mycak says the news coming out of Ukraine “continues to be devastating” and the “level of human tragedy is increasing” as the Russia-Ukraine war continues into its second week. <br /><br />“Due to the unsuccessful ground assaults, Russia is intensifying long-range air attacks – missiles, rockets – being fired from Russia and Belarus and intensifying aerial bombing,” she told Sky News host Chris Kenny. <br /><br />“We now can see clearly that Russian forces are deliberately targeting civilians.”{% endraw %}
