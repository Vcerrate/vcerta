{% raw %}AErdogan: Turkey will continue to provide assistance to Ukraine. <br />The Turkish President announced that Ankara would continue to provide necessary assistance to Ukraine.<br />Turkish President Recep Erdogan said that his country is still a NATO member, however, Ankara does not intend to spoil relations with either Russia or Ukraine. However, Erdogan emphasized that to date, Turkey has sent about 50 trucks with various assistance to Ukraine and will continue to do so, despite the position of Russia.<br /><br />“What does NATO cooperation mean when I say “military”? NATO is also an institution where military solidarity is formed. NATO is currently based in Germany. We are two partners with NATO. We are two important NATO countries. It's probably very important to appreciate this among us in this process. We must maintain our friendship with both Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Putin. With regard to sanctions, we did what was necessary within the framework of UN rules, and we did for Ukraine what NATO member countries did not do, despite Russia. Similarly, we sent more than 50 trucks to Ukraine and continue to do so.”, the Turkish leader said during a joint press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. <br />Experts draw attention to the fact that Turkey continues to supply its weapons to Ukraine. At the same time, this is not at all hidden in Ankara itself, emphasizing that the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 attack drones demonstrate high results, however, the deliveries are not made by the Turkish Ministry of Defense, but by a private company, in connection with which there can be no claims against Ankara.{% endraw %}
