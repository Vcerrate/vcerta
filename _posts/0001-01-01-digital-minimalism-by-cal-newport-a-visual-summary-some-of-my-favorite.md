{% raw %}Some of my favorite ideas from the book and how I'm applying them to my life.<br />Want to learn how to take visual notes like what you see here?<br />Join Verbal to Visual: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.verbaltovisual.com/">http://www.verbaltovisual.com/</a><br /><br />Show notes for this video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.verbaltovisual.com/digital-minimalism-by-cal-newport-a-visual-summary/">https://www.verbaltovisual.com/digital-minimalism-by-cal-newport-a-visual-summary/</a><br /><br />My name is Doug Neill and I'm passionate about helping others reach their full creative potential. I teach a skill called sketchnoting (also known as visual note-taking and graphic recording), which for me is a gateway to doing better work.<br /><br />I've chosen to not be on any social media platforms other than YouTube.<br /><br />To stay in touch via email, subscribe to my newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/nwHp">https://geni.us/nwHp</a>{% endraw %}
