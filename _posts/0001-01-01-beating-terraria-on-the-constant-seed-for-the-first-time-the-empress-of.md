{% raw %}The Empress of Light is like the Moon Lord's behemoth mother if we're a fast food worker and make the fatal error of putting pickles on the Moon Lord's burger. We get thrown into the deep fryer. In this video, we take on the Constant World Seed for the first time and document our experience in its entirety. Never have I thought that this beautiful crossover would result in an unholy amount of existential terror in the form of Daypress' second phase. I am scarred for the rest of my life. Thank you all so much for watching, be sure to drop a like and subscribe for more content like this, as well as leave a comment down in the comment section below. Also, thank you for not drawing Plantera and I having a beautiful romantic candle lit dinner together, I would be SO upset if I saw that on the internet some time hopefully soon.<br /><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/j8DhR8UMTB">https://discord.gg/j8DhR8UMTB</a><br /><br />Instagram: carsonander<br /><br />Become a member today to get access to perks!:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbXiWfLHx2MQc4eXW5-9xIw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbXiWfLHx2MQc4eXW5-9xIw/join</a>{% endraw %}
