{% raw %}The Multiverse has cracked open and Marvel heroes are spilling out. From Spiderman: Now Way Home to the upcoming Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, alternate dimensions are the hot new way to further monetize old content. <br /><br />So now that we have seen 3 Spider-Men what's next? How about we get really crazy and throw out some former Marvel Heroes we could see make a very surprising appearance. Hey whatever happened to Ghost Rider? The Council of Reed Richards is certainly a possibility. Can one dream that we will soon see Punisher: Into the Punisherverse? I certainly hope so. Join Chris Goodmakers as he speculates and details the surprise heroes who may pop out of a portal soon.  <br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant</a><br /><br />Chapters:<br />0:00 - Intro <br />0:21 - Ghostride the Whip<br />1:38 - The Muscle Ghost<br />2:41 - Affleck's Devil<br />4:17 - Elektra Returns<br />5:20 - Reed’s Council<br />8:01 - Into The Punisher Verse<br /><br />Check out Screen Rant’s official TikTok! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@screenrant">https://www.tiktok.com/@screenrant</a> <br /><br />Our Social Media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/screenrant">https://twitter.com/screenrant</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant">https://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant</a>  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/screen-rant/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/screen-rant/</a> <br /><br />Our Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://screenrant.com/">http://screenrant.com/</a><br /><br />Video By: Chris Goodmakers<br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com{% endraw %}
