{% raw %}Health-Related Quality of life addressed by means of postural support: for those at risk of developing scoliosis and windswept distortion who cannot perform exercises or change posture. Poster presentation by E de Ru &amp; S. Clayton. Individuals with extremely limited movement are at high risk of developing changes in body shape. The link between unsupported supine lying and the development of postural asymmetry was first identified in 1976. These changes are highly predictable and should be preventable. A recent scoping review of current practice on postural care acknowledges “Poor postural care can have severe and life-threatening complications.” The Confidential Inquiry into Premature Death of People with Learning Disabilities highlights more than 40% of premature deaths being caused by pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia. Many children and adolescents with a neuromuscular scoliosis are at risk for curve progression and structural changes.<br />Conclusions<br />Interest is most focused on the spine but we need to protect the chest shape also. Acknowledged in numerous UK policy documents is that a 24-hour approach to postural care provision is required in order to protect individuals at risk of changes caused by gravity.{% endraw %}
