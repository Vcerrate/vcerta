{% raw %}Poet and writer Yrsa Daley-Ward chats to Idler editor Tom Hodgkinson about her new book, 'The How: Notes on the Great Work of Meeting Yourself' (Penguin). <br /><br />The book is a brilliant antidote to all the how-tos and &quot;remedies&quot; – an invitation to let go of the constant pressure to improve and do better.

She was raised by her grandparents in the small town of Chorley in the North of England and now lives and works in New York City. In her writing, Yrsa tackles issues dealing with all parts of the human condition, particularly those ‘we don’t tend to speak of.’ Issues of social awareness such as mental health, sexuality, love, grief and addiction. “If you are afraid to write it, that’s a good sign.” She is best known for her debut collection Bone (2017) and her critically acclaimed poetic memoir The Terrible (2018), both published by Penguin.<br /><br />This conversation was recorded as part of the Idler's weekly online event, A Drink with the Idler. The full recording is available to magazine and Academy subscribers.
