{% raw %}The fact that this kind of story is so wide spread across the motorcycle community and that it happens on a daily basis is something i can't wrap my head around. This can't be a normal thing! Exceeding deadlines like it's no big deal (without valid reason) is unthinkable in many other industries and business. (i would loose ALL my jobs as a prossional musician and producer, working like this) I'm shocked and very disappointed about this situation but there's not much i can do than just wait until the next deadline for now. I have no place to work on the motorbike myself (i couldn't even store it somewhere like this) and i'm afraid i won't be able to get appointments at other berlin repair shops this time of the motorcycle season. Fingers Crossed he'll make good on his word this time!<br /><br />Ps. I don't wanna hurt anyone's business, so pls don't ask me for the name of the shop...the guy had to endure my yelling already, he doesnâ€™t need any keyboard warriors giving him a hard time;) remember: EVERYBODY SCREWS UP SOMETIMES!<br /><br />#hondadominator #motorcyclerepair #repairshop <br /><br />Support the Channel and become a Member:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG8_CK8yqU4RG_teeikQ5sw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG8_CK8yqU4RG_teeikQ5sw/join</a><br /><br />Get your Marc Travels Merch here:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.marctravelsshop.com/">https://www.marctravelsshop.com/</a><br /><br />Portugal on Honda Dominator 650 Adventure<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_5-FeRUB-_S3R3_-0HVf1rhXRF2vQsC4">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_5-FeRUB-_S3R3_-0HVf1rhXRF2vQsC4</a><br /><br />The whole Iceland Adventure Playlist:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_5-FeRUB-_Ti6Cp1m_-2pG0aRZs7O5tV">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_5-FeRUB-_Ti6Cp1m_-2pG0aRZs7O5tV</a><br /><br /><br />More How To's here:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_5-FeRUB-_T25JN7cyTv0aUJkAOD1zf2">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_5-FeRUB-_T25JN7cyTv0aUJkAOD1zf2</a><br /><br />Find all Episodes of our Journey through Europe here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_5-FeRUB-_TJVQXqkkpBYEsx7u9o1w9D">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_5-FeRUB-_TJVQXqkkpBYEsx7u9o1w9D</a><br /><br />Drone Clips here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_5-FeRUB-_TBKp1ZGWShpcFcX3muFY4u">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_5-FeRUB-_TBKp1ZGWShpcFcX3muFY4u</a><br /><br />Thank you for watching and subscribing.<br /><br />Get Shirts and stuff here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/marc-travels-shop">https://teespring.com/stores/marc-travels-shop</a><br /><br />Thank you for watching and subscribing.<br /><br />Updates here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/marctravelsblog">https://www.facebook.com/marctravelsblog</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/marc.travels.blog">https://www.instagram.com/marc.travels.blog</a><br /><br />Music: <br /><br />Royalty Free Music<br />Youtube Music Library<br /><br />Bike and Camera Equipment:<br /><br />Honda NX 650 RD02&quot;Dominator&quot; build in 1989.<br />Some specs you can find here: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_NX650_Dominator">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_NX650_Dominator</a><br /><br />DJI Mavic Mini Drone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dji.com/de/mavic-mini">https://www.dji.com/de/mavic-mini</a><br />DJI Osmo Action: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dji.com/de/osmo-action">https://www.dji.com/de/osmo-action</a><br />Dji Osmo Pocket: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dji.com/de/osmo-pocket">https://www.dji.com/de/osmo-pocket</a><br />DJI POCKET 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dji.com/de/pocket-2">https://www.dji.com/de/pocket-2</a><br />DJI MINI 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dji.com/de/mini-2">https://www.dji.com/de/mini-2</a><br /><br />Insta 360 GO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-go">https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-go</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-go2">https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-go2</a><br /><br /><br />Editing Software:<br />Luma Fusion 2.0<br />Just recently stumbled across this great editing app for the iphone and i am super impressed and loive working with it.
