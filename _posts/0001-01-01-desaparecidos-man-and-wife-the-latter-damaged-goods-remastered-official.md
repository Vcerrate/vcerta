{% raw %}Desaparecidos - Man And Wife, The Latter (Damaged Goods) (Remastered)<br />from Read Music/Speak Spanish (Remastered)<br />Order: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://desa.scfm.me/rmss">https://desa.scfm.me/rmss</a><br /><br />Remastered by Ted Jensen<br /><br />-----<br /><br />LYRICS<br />I'm growing out my hair like it was when I was single<br />It was longer than I'd known you<br />I had no money then<br />I had no worries then at all<br /><br />Such a high standard of living I just feel like I am dying<br />I would start an argument but you can barely even talk<br />But there is always good reason for your silence<br />You have to take care of some business<br />So I fix your plate and I stay out of the way<br /><br />And you will stay like that forever, <br />right in front of your computer<br />You'll look up one day but you won't recognize me<br /><br />So now you want to change<br />You read a letter from a lawyer<br />Want to take me out to dinner<br />Want to bury me under a mound of shopping bags<br /><br />Like it would really make a difference <br />or make up for your disinterest<br />I'm a bill you pay<br />I'm a contract you can't break<br /><br />And it is like I'm under water <br />or on an endless escalator<br />I just go up and up <br />but I don't ever reach the top<br /><br />And it reads just like the bible, <br />twenty centuries of scandal, <br />I guess it all depends on how you interpret it<br /><br />The word is LOVE<br />The word is LOSS<br />The words are DAMAGED GOODS<br />That is what I am<br />A lifetime gets chalked-up to an experience, <br />coincidence, we are chained to the events<br />That's it<br /><br />#desaparecidos #saddlecreek #readmusicspeakspanish{% endraw %}
