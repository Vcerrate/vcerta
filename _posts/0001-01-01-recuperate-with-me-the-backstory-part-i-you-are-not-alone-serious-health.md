{% raw %}You are not alone! Serious health crisis? Let’s get through it together! <br /> <br />I was shock to learn I had cancer, but I’m moving forward by becoming the best version of myself I can possibly be. They key word is had and standing in agreement with you that it’s not gonna come back!<br /><br />I’m still recovering but it’s a process that I think some of you can relate. I’m sharing tips on wellness, mental health and self care. I’m also sharing plant-based recipes that I’m going to try probably for the first time! Do you have a caregiver that’s a spouse or relative? How do you support them?<br /><br />As I share, please feel free to share with me! <br /><br />Thank you in advance for joining me on this road to recovery!<br /><br /><br />#prayer #meditation #healthandwellness #mentalhealth #healthylifestyle #cancersurvivor #healthyfood #hairmaintenance #skincareroutine #skincare #plantbased #weightloss #exercise #f*#%cancer #marriedlife #travelvlog #sugarbuster{% endraw %}
