Well believe it or not science has the answer. <br /><br /><br />___________________________________________________________________________<br /><br /><br />Link To The Capitalists Discord where I hang out with other creators -  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/8MeNJ7gfSR">https://discord.gg/8MeNJ7gfSR</a><br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound<br /><br />Stock footage by Storyblocks{% endraw %}
