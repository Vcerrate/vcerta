{% raw %}2022 Season of the Spanish Hard Enduro debuted with Rd 1 La Clua De Basella on the last weekend of January, 29-30th.<br /><br />We kicked off the racing weekend with the training session which took 2h of practice for anyone willing. After than it was prologue time and each rider hit it for two hot laps. Saturday ended with the prologue and we headed to the main event on Sunday.<br /><br />The main race was a tricky one just as the prologue and caused a lot of trouble to the riders. Prologue winner Mario Roman came in P1 and won the race in the end. He is accompanied by Teodor Kabakchiev (P2) and Francesc Moret Clota (P3).<br /><br />Spanish Hard Enduro Calendar 2022<br />Round 1 – LA CLUA DE BASSELLA, Lleida – 29/30 January<br />Round 2 – CANTORIA, Almería – 12/13 February<br />Round 3 – LA PESQUERA, Cuenca – 19/20 March<br />Round 4 – OVIEDO, Asturias – 22/23 October<br />Round 5 – ALMEDINA, Ciudad Real – 2/6 November{% endraw %}
