{% raw %}Took Ryanâ€™s kits and a few of the others out today with the main objective being to enter them into something a little bigger to build their stamina and gain some more experience, I also took the opportunity to expose my renown fashion sense and trendsetting nature HA HA, thank God for wide angle lens _ Grin. Enjoy Guys!{% endraw %}
