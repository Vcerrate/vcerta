{% raw %}11 CoComelon Tom Hurry to the Toilet Sound Variations in 40 seconds<br />The idea is taken from the channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSnA4xX9OTUoqLo1B2wqi9w/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSnA4xX9OTUoqLo1B2wqi9w/videos</a><br />Hello everyone To make such an animation, I search for a lot of pictures on the Internet that do not have copyrights, connect them with sound. I mount everything in Sony Vegas 16 for about an hour, then I cut out png images from the video and make a preview of them in Photoshop for about 20 minutes, I think it deserves your like guys! I love you! Enjoy watching, comment and put likes so that more people see the video!<br />Copyright by SM (Sound Meme)<br />All rights reserved<br />#soundvariations​​​ #soundvariationsmeme​​​​ #meme{% endraw %}
