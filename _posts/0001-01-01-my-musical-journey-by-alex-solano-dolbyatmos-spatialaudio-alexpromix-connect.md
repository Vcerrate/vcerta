You invest time and money in gear and training to become more proficient, but there's the sense of &quot;am I doing this right?&quot; <br /><br />I've studied music all my life and graduated with a B.A. degree in Music Technology and have trained privately with accomplished professionals in the recording industry. My 20 years of experience have led me to work with international clients while providing a comprehensive music service, training, and mentorship. <br /><br />Alex provides a clear path and strategy to achieve the best results, every time. <br /><br />Connect with Alex: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.alexpromix.com">https://www.alexpromix.com</a>{% endraw %}
