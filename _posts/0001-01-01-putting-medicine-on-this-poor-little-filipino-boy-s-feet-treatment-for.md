I need your helping hands to give joy to Filipino families, one at a time.<br /><br />How it works:<br />Your contribution goes straight to the individual/family we reach/help.<br />After we reached/helped 1 individual/family: We then move on to help another.<br />Our objective is to reach 1 economically poor individual/family, one at a time. <br /><br />Important notes:<br /><br />1. I personally don't receive/get/take/pocket any amount of financial contributions from you guys.<br />Your contributions go straight to the families we reach and to other expenses. <br /><br />2. I do not publish on youtube the stories of the families we reach w/o a signed release agreement and parental/guardian consent.<br />The release agreement gives me a permission to publish their stories on youtube.<br /><br />3. Business, personal and GoFundMe fundraiser accounts: All the funds, contributions, sources of income and other monetary sources that go into my accounts are being reported to the taxman. My bank also reports to the taxman every year, by the end of the year, FYI. <br />There's a Certified Public Accountant who does the accounting and auditing of my accounts.<br />The Certified Public Accountant reports to the taxman.<br /><br />4. You don't need to open and register a charitable organization/foundation/institution to give help to people in the Philippines.<br />Reaching and giving help to people in the Philippines is not illegal.<br />There's no law that states, that you need to open and register a charitable organization/foundation/institution first, before you are able to give help to people legally. <br /><br />5. GoFundMe checks the fundraiser account from time to time. <br />They sometimes ask for verification and validation.<br /><br /><br />The reason why I upload films about poverty in the Philippines is to spread awareness.<br /><br />To combat economic inequality, social injustice, oppressions, repressions, abuses and exploitations:<br />1st: We have to be aware.<br />2nd: We have to pay attention.<br />3rd: We have to do something about it.<br /><br />We as Filipinos and citizens of this planet should not turn a blind eye, not to play deaf and not to pretend mute. <br />We as human beings have a responsibility to give care and to show compassion to others. <br />We as citizens have a great responsibility to safeguard our ball of genuine democracy. <br />We as citizens have a responsibility to fight tyranny and corruption.<br /><br />Wake up my fellow citizens!<br /><br /><br />Again my friends, thank you very much...<br /><br />Yours,<br />MARK{% endraw %}
