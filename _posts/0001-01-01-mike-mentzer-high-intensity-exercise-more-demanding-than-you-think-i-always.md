{% raw %}I always felt this interview with Mike Mentzer may have been the most significant. I recall that I recorded this conversation in 1992, just before leaving to cover the 1992 Mr. Olympia contest in Helsinki, Finland. It was profound in many ways and had a broad application to people’s workout sessions. How demanding high-intensity training really is hadn’t really been broached before, but it would explain why workouts must be tailored to an individual’s ability to tolerate them. Volume and frequency are the corollary factors.{% endraw %}
