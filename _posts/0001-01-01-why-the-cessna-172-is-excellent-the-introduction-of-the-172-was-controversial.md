{% raw %}The introduction of the 172 was controversial as the 170 was a much-loved airplane, and the switch to tricycle gear was seen by some as a betrayal of tradition. Around the same time, Cessna also discontinued the taildragger 140 in favor of the all-metal tricycle gear 150. This certainly was a gamble for Cessna, ending production of popular, proven designs, but it was a gamble that paid off. The companyâ€™s new consumer airplanes, the 172 and 182, were tricycle gear designs that had long lives and prodigious production numbers while boasting two of the best safety records in light GA. Their production numbers speak for how well that equation worked for the flying public.<br />#Cessna172 #Cessna #172<br />_________________________________________________<br />To contact me directly: Dashboardglobal@techie.com <br />_________________________________________________<br />Our channel is about Aviation.<br />We make the best educational aviation videos you've ever seen; my videos are designed to clear misunderstandings about airplanes and explain complicated aviation topics in a simple way.{% endraw %}
