{% raw %}The Kodiak Bear is a unique species of Grizzly, known to be the largest species of bear in the world, living along the Kodiak Archipelago of Southern Alaska. In this documentary, cinematographer Andreas journeys into the depths of the great Alaskan wilderness to find some of the largest grizzly bears in the US. In his expedition, he travels through some of Alaska's most remote areas with his friend Greg and learns more about how the native Alaskan population lives in some of the most inhospitable spots of the frigid US State. <br /><br />Click here for more documentaries: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2gSPaf6">http://bit.ly/2gSPaf6</a><br /><br />Follow us on Facebook: facebook.com/realwildschannel<br /><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/realwildchannel/">https://www.instagram.com/realwildchannel/</a><br /><br />Any queries, please contact us at: owned-enquiries@littledotstudios.com<br /><br />#RealWild #Documentary{% endraw %}
