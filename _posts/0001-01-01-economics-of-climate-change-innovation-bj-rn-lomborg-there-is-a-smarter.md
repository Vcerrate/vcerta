{% raw %}There is a smarter way to source green energy instead of subsidies. In this smart talk, political scientist Bjørn Lomborg explains why Innovation in green energy is the solution to global warming.TEDArchive presents previously unpublished talks from TED conferences.<br />Enjoy this unedited talk by Bjørn Lomborg .<br />Filmed at TED2014.<br />NOTE: Comments are disabled on this video. We made this difficult decision for the TED Archive because we believe that a well-moderated conversation allows for better commentary from more people and more viewpoints. Studies show that aggressive and hateful comments silence other commenters and drive them away; unfortunately, YouTube's comment moderation tools are simply not up to the task of allowing us to monitor comments on so many videos at once. (We'd love to see this change, YouTube.) So for now, if you'd like to comment on this talk, please use Facebook, Twitter or G+  to discuss with your networks.{% endraw %}
