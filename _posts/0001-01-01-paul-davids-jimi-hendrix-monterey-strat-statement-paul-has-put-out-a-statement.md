{% raw %}Paul has put out a statement on Instagram which will clear up the situation with this guitar once and for all, as the current owner is putting together a panel of experts to review and evaluate the guitar purported to be the Monetery Strat.<br /><br />I will continue to follow this story for you and report on what happens. I look forward to seeing who the panel of experts includes. It is strange as the fender custom shop folks have not replied to my emails. More to come on that soon too.<br /><br />Disclaimer: If my voice sounds at all peculiar it is because I have an upper motor neuron disorder and speech can be an issue. I try my best but it is getting more evident.<br /><br />Please help the channel by using my affiliate links. It costs you nothing extra but helps the channel greatly, many thanks folks :-)<br />Thomann (Europe) : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/CGSthomann">https://bit.ly/CGSthomann</a><br />Sweetwater (USA &amp; Canada) : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://imp.i114863.net/KezZXx">https://imp.i114863.net/KezZXx</a><br /><br />Thanks so much to all of my Patrons for their awesome support: <br />Grumpy Mike, Ian Wood, James Mears, Dan O'Sullivan, Brad Miller, <br />Gary Tholander, And my Axe!, Jake Leigh Guitar, Yvan Shank, Grandpa Joe, Dennis Pointer, Mike Hurley, <br />The Lamb, Daz Ironworker, CJ and Pete Brown<br /><br />ðŸ”” SUBSCRIBE for more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/chinaguitarsceptic?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/chinaguitarsceptic?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />ðŸŽ¸ PATREON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/CGSuk">https://www.patreon.com/CGSuk</a><br />ðŸŽ¸ CGS Website and Forum: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ChinaGuitarSceptic.com">http://www.ChinaGuitarSceptic.com</a><br />ðŸŽ¸ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/chinaguitarsceptic">https://www.instagram.com/chinaguitarsceptic</a><br />ðŸŽ¸ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/China-Guitar-Sceptic-745208339154157/">https://www.facebook.com/China-Guitar-Sceptic-745208339154157/</a><br />ðŸ“§ Email me: chinaguitarsceptic@gmail.com{% endraw %}
