Subliminal affirmations are positive spoken words played at low volume and masked by other sounds, where they are then able to bypass our conscious mind, and enter our subconscious. Once in our subconscious, positive affirmations are able not only to affect our physical bodies, but the reality surrounding us. Undesirable changes suggested within affirmations will not be attained by the listener. Reaffirm to yourself what you would like to achieve through the subliminal before listening. The subconscious will only accept desirable, positive, &amp; beneficial affirmations.<br /><br />Thanks for listening! Good luck with your results.{% endraw %}
