{% raw %}I had a lot of fun with this one. Essentially here to prove Revali wrong by getting up to Vah Medoh on one's own. Nothing ground breaking, just a lot of silliness.<br />Normally the game has you get help from Teba, who flies you up, and that only proves Revali right... That's not what we want.<br /><br /><br />My Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MrOrdun">https://twitter.com/MrOrdun</a><br />My Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Kleric">https://www.patreon.com/Kleric</a><br /><br />Songs used:<br /><br />Revali's Theme (Age of Calamity)<br />TES IV: Oblivion main theme<br />Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker<br />The Dark World (Super Smash Bros.
