{% raw %}In this 15-minute at-home yoga session, we will use poses to ground and find stability while using pranayama to move stagnant energy. This therapeutic standing yoga practice will bring a healthy flow of energy to the body to aid the mind and heart so that you can find forward movement. This is a hands-free practice that can be done without a yoga mat too!  Use this 15 min practice to get out of a low situation, flush low energy, and gently stimulate your core. Come as you are, welcome balance back in.<br /><br /><br /> <br />- - - - - - - - - - <br /><br />❤️SUBSCRIBE to the YWA channel for free yoga videos every week and to support high-quality free yoga for all! ❤️<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - <br /><br />🧘🏽♂️🧘♀️Become a FWFG YOGA member! 🧘🏻♂️🧘🏿♀️<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fwfg.com/?via=adriene">https://fwfg.com/?via=adriene</a><br />Join Find What Feels Good and access over 700 videos including yoga and meditation for all levels.
