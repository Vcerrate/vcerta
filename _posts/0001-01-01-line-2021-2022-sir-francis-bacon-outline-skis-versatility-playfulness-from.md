Fully symmetrical twin tips, these skis are designed to rip anywhere on the mountain in style. With convex contouring of the base on the tip &amp; tail, weâ€™re able to loosen the overall feel when the tip or tail is pressured. Similar to a surfboard, the convexity adds dimensionality to the ways in which you can pressure, feather, and stand on a ski. The result is a ski that slashes better, butters with more control, improves float, and moves faster through powder.<br /><br />#LINEskis #Morefunner{% endraw %}
