{% raw %}Life coaching is extensively misunderstood term. Some people think that it is a modern therapy and some termed it as an expensive agony aunt but actually, it is a wide topic which needs to be understood properly. It is not just about therapy but counseling about the life of an individual. If one feeling hollow or lost for a longer time, he needs a mental coach who understands and educate him about life and this is actually what life coach does. It is not about only mental illness but covers all the aspects of life which one is worried about.{% endraw %}
