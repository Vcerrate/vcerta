{% raw %}~~~ The audio is out of synch toward the end of the video. I'm sorry :( ~~~<br /><br />Subscribe - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwGXtxhF-Jn90wj0TgAqwCA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwGXtxhF-Jn90wj0TgAqwCA</a> <br /><br />Have an idea for a compilation that you want to see? Comment below or send me an email at ggcomp2014@gmail.com<br /><br />This channel first started uploading Game Grumps content back in 2014. This content is not officially associated with the Game Grumps but I got permission to run it from them way back in 2015 and even Danny said he appreciated compilation channels sharing the love. This channel has had multiple editors over time who enjoy contributing to the community, some of the content is very outdated at this point but serves as an interesting look into an older era of YouTube. Plus the content holds up and it's worth watching the old stuff.{% endraw %}
