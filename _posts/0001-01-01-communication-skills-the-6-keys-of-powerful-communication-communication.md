Conversely, remedying communication issues will reap rewards for your whole lifetime. Six key areas sum up the most common failures that contribute to communication issues. <br /><br />The six pillars of effective communication are: assertiveness, authenticity, open-mindedness, empathy, clarity and listening.<br /><br />If you have something to say, say it assertively, so you will be taken seriously. Identify your values, boundaries, and own agenda, so that you can communicate them authentically. Smiling and being afraid to contradict someone may be interpreted as being inauthentic. Be open-minded to the positions of others, which helps you grow as a person. <br /><br />Be empathetic to your listener, which builds common ground. The more clarity you use in communicating, the less likely it will be misconstrued. And don't just hear; demonstrate active listening.<br /><br />Disclaimer: All personal development advice and information is provided as-is and may not suit your specific circumstances.
