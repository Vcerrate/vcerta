{% raw %}Ing. Trudy Morgan has always shown a passion to support women in engineering and encourage young girls into engineering. However, her journey has taught her that good intentions remain intangible and unseen until they are translated into actions. In a world of adversities, Ing. Trudy continues to lay the foundation for the next generation of female engineers. Ing. Trudy Morgan is the first African woman to be awarded a<br />Fellowship of the Institution of Civil Engineers (FICE) and the<br />first female Vice President of the Sierra Leone Institution of<br />Engineers (SLIE). She is also the first female and current<br />president of the SLIE. In 2015, Morgan co-founded Sierra<br />Leone Women Engineers, a special interest group of SLIE, to<br />support women in engineering and encourage girls into<br />engineering. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
