{% raw %}Well the Queen certainly made her Platinum Jubilee statement memorable! It is a shame the media went into overdrive about her wishes for Camilla to be known as Queen Consort rather than the day itself. <br /><br />Outrage has been caused to some due to a statement made by Palace officials back in 2005,  at the time of Charles second wedding, that Camilla was reportedly going to be known as Princess Consort. That was deleted and no one mentioned it so some members of the public feel they were lied to. Also there seems to still be a lot of resentment, over Princess Diana. <br /><br />I had a few queries come in regarding titles and why was Philip not King or even Prince consort and I have tried my best to answer these in this video.  <br /><br />Back soon with a video discussing Harry at the Super bowl with Princess Eugenie, minus the Wife! How curious??<br /><br />Taz xx{% endraw %}
