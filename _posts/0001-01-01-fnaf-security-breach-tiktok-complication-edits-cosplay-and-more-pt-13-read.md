{% raw %}The following audio/music does NOT belong to me, they go to their rightful owners. This also includes the Audio/music feature in each tiktok. Also, each tiktok is handpicked and downloaded. The edits, cosplays, and fanart in this TikTok complication do NOT belong to me, it belongs to the people in the watermark at the end of every tiktok.<br /><br />(Read This First!)<br />Hi guys, its me Sarah’s Creations here, I want to highly apologize for reuploading this video consistently, but I have my reasons. The video being partially blocked prevented a lot of people from seeing my content, which means, say for example: You live in the UK and wanted to watch my content, welp, you can’t because its limited to certain countries. So ya, Sorry for the inconvenience everyone. I ended up just deleting the work and starting over. <br /><br />Follow my other social medias:<br />Tumblr: FNAF and Creepypasta Inform Forever <br />Twitter: @sarahscreati0ns<br />TikTok: @sarahscreations01{% endraw %}
