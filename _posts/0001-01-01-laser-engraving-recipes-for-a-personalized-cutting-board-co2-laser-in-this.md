{% raw %}In this video, watch as we use one of our CO2 lasers to personalize a cutting board with handwritten, family recipes which presents a meaningful gift that will last for generations to come. Who doesn't love a recipe that has made its way down the family tree? This laser engraving woodworking project represents a piece of family history that can be enjoyed by everyone. The process of transferring the recipe consisted of a few simple steps. It started as a photo, was then imported onto Adobe® Illustrator to be made a vector, and was finalized in Lightburn® software where the file was complete. You can take the design one step further with a custom engraved initial or artistic graphic for a more elaborate version. <br /><br />Explore the SmartShop® Laser|EX: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/35KcaZv">https://bit.ly/35KcaZv</a><br />Subscribe to our CNC email list for deals and promotions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3IWnMH4">https://bit.ly/3IWnMH4</a><br /><br />►Contact us for more info: 800.234.1976 or email: CNCSales@lagunatools.com<br />►Subscribe now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2r5Czgc">http://bit.ly/2r5Czgc</a> <br />►Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2mph6wt">http://bit.ly/2mph6wt</a> <br />►Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2qiHpXi">http://bit.ly/2qiHpXi</a>{% endraw %}
