The term #ASMR (асмр, 音フェチ) describes a pleasant physical sensation, known as tingles. It is triggered by various different stimuli. Popular triggers are whispering and soft voices, ear cleaning, ear massage, tapping, crinkle sounds, water sounds, haircut, and many more. ASMR videos like this are intended to help you sleep, relax, study and focus and, most importantly, give you some good ASMR.<br /><br />Lean back, relax and embrace the tingles.<br />___________ <br />AVAILABLE ON SPOTIFY!
