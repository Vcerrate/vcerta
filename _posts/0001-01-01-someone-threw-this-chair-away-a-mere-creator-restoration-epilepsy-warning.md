{% raw %}I found this red oak rocking chair thrown away on the side of the road. It looked to have been kept outdoors most of its life. The connections were lose and some parts were broken, but it was mostly cosmetic. I took it home and refinished all surfaces and glued shut all the joints. Thatâ€™s all it takes! Hope you enjoy.<br /><br /><br />Allow me to make more videos like this by supporting on Patreon!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/amircreator">https://www.patreon.com/amircreator</a><br />Follow me on Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/a.mere.creator/">https://www.instagram.com/a.mere.creator/</a><br /><br /><br />Drill and driver: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VfxyNr">https://amzn.to/2VfxyNr</a><br />Japanese pull saw: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Vaia4O">https://amzn.to/2Vaia4O</a><br />Random orbit sander: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3fhd1Rt">https://amzn.to/3fhd1Rt</a><br />Drill bits: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SvXy6F">https://amzn.to/2SvXy6F</a><br /><br />Doweling Jig: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2CUcvuf">https://amzn.to/2CUcvuf</a><br />Red clamp: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2KWUDQ8">https://amzn.to/2KWUDQ8</a><br />Pipe clamp: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3aXX9A7">https://amzn.to/3aXX9A7</a><br /><br />Varathane Gunstock Wood Stain: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZSlXpE">https://amzn.to/2ZSlXpE</a><br /><br />Beeswax Wood Polish &amp; Conditioner: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2BUioaq">https://amzn.to/2BUioaq</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Some of these links lead to products and tools used in the video.
