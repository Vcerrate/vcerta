{% raw %}Does This Item Still Make You Invincible In Elden Ring?<br />Its been about a month since I made a video about barricade shield in the Elden Ring Network Test.

Today, I find out whether barricade shield can still make you untouchable or not as well as how bad the nerfs really are. <br /><br />WATCH ME LIVE ON TWITCH:<br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/skumnut">https://www.twitch.tv/skumnut</a><br /><br />Connect With Me:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/skumnut/">https://www.instagram.com/skumnut/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/skumnut">https://twitter.com/skumnut</a><br /><br />Background Music - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6kdkkcOxtU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6kdkkcOxtU</a><br /><br />#Eldenring #Darksouls #fromsoft #gaming{% endraw %}
