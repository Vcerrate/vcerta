{% raw %}We're often hugely ambitious about our plans for happiness, picturing the years of joy we want to set in motion. However, at points, we should realise the greater wisdom of learning to enjoy the day already in hand, and drawing satisfaction from that most precious and most neglected of units of time; the present moment.  <br />Sign up to our new newsletter and get 10% off your first online order of a book, product or class: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2LayJ9F">https://bit.ly/2LayJ9F</a><br />For gifts and more from The School of Life, visit our online shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2LJTT3b">https://bit.ly/2LJTT3b</a><br />Our website has classes, articles and products to help you lead a more fulfilled life: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/331QQsK">https://bit.ly/331QQsK</a><br /><br /><br />FURTHER READING<br /><br />You can read more on this and other subjects on our blog, here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2K50Ate">https://bit.ly/2K50Ate</a><br /><br />“Without us perhaps quite noticing, much of what we place our hopes in will be ready for us in a very a long time indeed, in months or even decades from now (if ever): the successful completion of a novel, a sufficient sum of money to buy a house or begin a new career, the discovery of a suitable partner, a move to another country. In the list of our most intensely-felt hopes, few entries stand to come to fruition this season or next, let alone by tonight.But occasionally, life places us in a situation where our normal long-range hopeful way of thinking grows impossible. You’ve had a car accident; a very bad one. For weeks, it seemed like you might not make it at all, now you’re out of a coma and back home, but you still have multiple broken bones, serious bruises and constant migraines. It’s unclear from here when you’ll be going back to work – or whether you ever will. When someone asks how things are, one answer seem to fit above all: we’re taking it one day at a time.”<br /><br /><br />MORE SCHOOL OF LIFE<br /><br />Visit us in person at our London HQ: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2LPDVV5">https://bit.ly/2LPDVV5</a><br /><br />Watch more films on SELF in our playlist: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/TSOLself">http://bit.ly/TSOLself</a><br /><br />You can submit translations and transcripts on all of our videos here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog&amp;tab=2">https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog&amp;tab=2</a> <br />Find out how more here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en-GB">https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en-GB</a> <br /><br /><br />SOCIAL MEDIA<br /><br />Feel free to follow us at the links below:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/">https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/</a>  <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife">https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife</a>   <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/">https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/</a> <br /><br /><br />CREDITS<br /><br />Produced in collaboration with:<br /> <br />Natalia Biegaj<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nb-animation.com/">https://www.nb-animation.com/</a><br /><br />Title animation produced in collaboration with<br /><br />Vale Productions<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.valeproductions.co.uk/">https://www.valeproductions.co.uk/</a>{% endraw %}
