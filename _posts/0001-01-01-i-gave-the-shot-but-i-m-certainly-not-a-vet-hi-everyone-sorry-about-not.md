{% raw %}Hi everyone, sorry about not having a video last Saturday but we were in New Orleans and just didnt put one up. We are having goat babies. Things seem to be going just fine so far. Only 3 bottle babies, unfortunately the doe we treated didnt make it, but its all good, we got 3 healthy babies and they are doing well. Thanks so much for watching<br /><br />Harmless Farmer<br />PO Box 844<br />West Liberty, Ohio 43357<br /><br /><br />adetwilerfarms@yahoo.com{% endraw %}
