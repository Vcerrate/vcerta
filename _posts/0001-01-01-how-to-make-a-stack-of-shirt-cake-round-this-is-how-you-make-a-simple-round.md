{% raw %}This is how you make a simple, round cake that looks like a stack of four shirts. This one is made of red velvet with cream cheese filling, crumbcoated with buttercream and covered with colored fondant (blue, yellow, orange, and red). <br /><br />Very easy to make. Just follow this video. If you have any questions, just ask me in the comments section. I'll do my best to answer them.<br /><br />Hope you enjoyed this one.
