{% raw %}In this episode of TFBTV, James Reeves reviews the Bushmaster Bravo Zulu carbine, and takes this as an opportunity to discuss what features to look for in an AR-15. James' first AR was a Bushmaster Patrolman's Carbine, an early civilianized version of the military's M4 rifle. The AR-15 and M-16 have been around since the 1960s, but even in the past 20 years, there have been vast improvements in the design and build of this rifle. James discusses those advances and tells you &quot;what's the deal with new Bushmaster?&quot;<br /><br />««« GEAR USED IN THIS VIDEO »»»<br />• AR-15s in stock at Top Gun Supply: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.topgunsupply.com/ar15-rifles-for-sale.html">https://www.topgunsupply.com/ar15-rifles-for-sale.html</a><br />• Optic James is Using - Trijicon MRO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3JUWrVV">https://bit.ly/3JUWrVV</a><br />• James' favorite sling (BFG Vickers): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3JkN2Xt">https://bit.ly/3JkN2Xt</a><br />• James' Sunglasses of Choice: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Iso4F4">https://amzn.to/3Iso4F4</a><br />• Oakley Ballistic M-Frame Shooting Glasses: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3tg58Uj">https://amzn.to/3tg58Uj</a><br />• Walker Razor Slim Electronic Muffs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3CdwC1b">https://amzn.to/3CdwC1b</a><br />• Apparel: All TFBTV apparel is sponsored by 5.11 Tactical and you can get it at www.511tactical.com<br /><br />««« GUN AND GEAR GIVEAWAYS »»»<br />Check out our Utreon and SubscribeStar pages if you enjoy our program, and consider helping us at TFBTV out.
