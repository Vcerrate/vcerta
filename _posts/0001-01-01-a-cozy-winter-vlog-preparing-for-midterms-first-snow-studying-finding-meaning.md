{% raw %}Dear Airies ✨<br /><br />I can’t believe that this is our first video of 2022…I wanted to create more videos but it just took me longer to film and edit a video than usual. I hope everyone had a great start into the year and is doing well. <br /><br />This cozy winter vlog has been filmed over a longer time period and dates back to December until January 2022 🙌🏻 It was filmed during the winter holidays so we had lots of time doing stuff we like and had to prepare for midterms as well so we spent a big amount of time studying 📚 Midterms are over now and finals are in a month so please wish us good luck! <br /><br />We also spent a good time watching kdramas (I still cant believe that The red sleeve has ended 🥺) and went outside, visited mosques, met friends, went out for walks and a little hike, went to a library and literally anything. <br />It was a really good time and I’m already missing the holidays TT <br /><br />I also wrote about my thoughts on a quote from a book I’m currently reading in the epilogue and it felt so good to share my thoughts with others on finding meaning. I think it’s a very important yet often forgotten topic and I hope that it helped you have a little insight on your own purpose as well. <br /><br />Always stay safe and healthy. <br />Hope you enjoy this video and as always thank you so so much for watching ❤️<br /> ~ <br /><br />Lots of love, <br />Milkcloud<br /><br />// our social media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tokkicloud/">https://www.instagram.com/tokkicloud/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/miilkytae/">https://www.instagram.com/miilkytae/</a><br /><br />Here is our goodreads in case you’d like to know what we are currently reading. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/miilkytae">https://www.goodreads.com/miilkytae</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/tokkicloud">https://www.goodreads.com/tokkicloud</a> <br /><br />//other discount codes: <br />Yesstyle link <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ys.style/nrO429iQ2hb">https://ys.style/nrO429iQ2hb</a>  Code:  MILKCLOUD<br />The washi tape shop: Cloud10 <br />Stationery Pal: milkcloud  <br /> <br />Collaboration with smile studio: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1028725062/">https://www.etsy.com/listing/1028725062/</a> <br />You can use our code AIRIES for a discount on your order and receive some extra benefits   <br /><br />//music used in the video: <br />Epidemic Sound : get a 30 day free trial here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/2swow1/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/2swow1/</a> <br />Pair Piano <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-sGBpquT8KThBJ2ruLdg-Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-sGBpquT8KThBJ2ruLdg-Q</a> <br /><br />// Contact 💌 <br />(only for business, NOT accepting any penpals !!)<br />hello.milkcloud@gmail.com{% endraw %}
