{% raw %}In this subject and predicate video lesson, you'll learn that every complete sentence has two parts. The subject tells us what or who the sentence is about, and the predicate explains what the subject is or what it is doing. The subject is the naming part, while the predicate is the doing part. Learn to identify simple subjects, simple predicates, compound subjects, and compound predicates with vivid definitions and loads of examples. With animation being the essential ingredient for easy learning retention in kids of grade 2, grade 3, and grade 4, this subject and predicate video has plenty in store. Watch and rewatch the video, and we are sure you’ll be both entertained and educated at the same time.<br />___________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />*Free worksheets: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tutoringhour.com/worksheets/">https://www.tutoringhour.com/worksheets/</a><br /><br />*Subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3cBMjn1">https://bit.ly/3cBMjn1</a><br /><br />*Catch us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ir7JVi​​​​​">https://bit.ly/3ir7JVi​​​​​</a><br /><br />#SubjectPedicateDefinitions <br />#SubjectPredicateExamples <br />#SubjectPredicateDifferences #IdentifyingSubjectAndPredicateinSentences <br />#ElementarySchool <br />#PrimarySchool <br />#GrammarForKids <br />#ELA <br />#ESL <br />#EnglishGrammar <br />#SimpleSubject<br />#SimplePredicate<br />#CompoundSubject<br />#CompoundPredicate<br />#GrammarForGrade2<br />#GrammarForGrade3<br />#GrammarForGrade4{% endraw %}
