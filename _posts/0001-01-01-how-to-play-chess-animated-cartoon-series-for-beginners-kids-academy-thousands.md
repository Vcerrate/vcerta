Chess for kids is a great way to improve higher-order thinking and problem-solving skills, and reading and math skills.  Many US states and other countries around the world include chess in their curricula. <br /><br />The best part about chess for kids is that all children can play at whatever level of ability they possess.<br />To learn chess for kids, simplified instruction is necessary. Video lessons are an effective and easy way to learn the basics of chess as the chess moves, strategies and techniques are viewed and learned in small chunks.  <br /><br />The learner has the option to play the video multiple times until mastery of the concept or skill is mastered.  For instance, when a young player is working on how to learn chess, he or she discovers that in the opening moves of play it is important to control the center, develop your pieces and protect your king by castling. <br /><br />As the child’s ability level increases, the player can begin to learn strategic moves for a quick check-mate as well as how to defend against these moves.  The Scholar’s Mate is a 4-move check-mate strategy that many players learn when acquiring the basics of chess. <br /><br />Viewing games that chess masters played in the past is another great way to learn the basics of chess.  One such game is the Opera Game.  In this game, chess master Paul Morphy demonstrates one of the best active attacking games of all time.  <br />Teachers that encourage chess for kids in their classrooms see better results in the children’s academic performance and experience a positive classroom environment. <br /><br />Parents that play the game with children at home enjoy quality time with their kids and know that playing chess helps children academically.<br /><br /><br />#chessgame #kidsacademy #chessforkids<br /><br />Subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/iG2Bdr">https://goo.gl/iG2Bdr</a><br /><br />Connect with us on :<br /><br />Facebook:      <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/KidsAcademyC...">https://www.facebook.com/KidsAcademyC...</a><br />Twitter:           <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/KidsAcademyCo">https://twitter.com/KidsAcademyCo</a><br /><br />Install for free our Kids Academy Talented and Gifted Program for kids aged 2-10: <br /><br />App Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smart.link/59833db06a6b8">https://smart.link/59833db06a6b8</a><br />Google Play: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smart.link/5a1bea3272481">https://smart.link/5a1bea3272481</a><br />Our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kidsacademy.mobi/">https://www.kidsacademy.mobi/</a>{% endraw %}
