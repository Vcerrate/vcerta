{% raw %}Derek Prince: I think I'd like to begin by directing you to two verses of the New Testament and asking you if you can pick out a key phrase that is found in both of them. The first verse is Acts 20, verse 28, the second is first Timothy 4:16. So we'll begin with Acts 20 verse 28. And as I said, the contest is to pick out the key phrase which occurs in both. -{% endraw %}
