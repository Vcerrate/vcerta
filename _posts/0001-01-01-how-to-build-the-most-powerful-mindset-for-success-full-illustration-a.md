You can get a better job. You can ace your chemistry test. Sure, there will be setbacks, but your abilities will improve. <br /><br />And perhaps more importantly, failures don’t seem so bleak. Setbacks aren’t a reflection of your self-worth. Frustrations don’t mean it’s time to give up — they just mean it’s time to pivot. And isn’t that just a more exciting, joyful way to live?<br /><br />⏱ TIMESTAMPS<br />0:00 - Intro<br />2:29 - Way #1<br />3:05 - Way #2<br />3:46 - Way #3<br />4:20 - Way #4<br />5:33 - Way #5<br />6:35 - Way #6<br /><br />A very special thank you to all of you who have become Members of The Art of Improvement.
