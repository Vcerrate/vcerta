{% raw %}This should be most, if not all, of the various ways you can end up getting bonked by Jimmy in At Dead of Night and learning why Sea View is a three star hotel. This should fulfill my promise for a bonk montage. The game over/bad ending for getting bonked in the final segment is included. The jumpscare itself is more or less the same but with different ways to trigger it and some instances (particularly when suddenly turning the corner) may startle more easily.<br /><br />A few notes about this: Jimmy only attacks when you're not facing him so if you see him duck behind a corner he remains in place until you turn away (or move forward and get bonked). Whenever Jimmy is entering a room the camera is turned from the door because of this. Likewise, Jimmy only bonks you in the elevator if you look out whenever he would be there (you can hear his footsteps while in the elevator that will mean he'll bonk you if you look out). <br /><br />Under normal circumstances you shouldn't be bonked after exiting the elevator. If Jimmy has spawned on a floor and you wait looking out of the elevator until you hear his footsteps, then exiting should result in a quick bonk.<br /><br />I'm not 100% sure Jimmy can't find you in the wardrobe (it seems he often hides in the bathroom if he suspects you're there) but after multiple tries I couldn't get him to open the wardrobe and bonk me.<br /><br />0:00 Elevator Ambush (and the normal wake scene after being bonked)<br />0:39 Around Corners<br />0:48 Found in the Bathroom<br />1:21 Bathroom Surprise<br />1:57 Not Hiding (At Door)<br />2:22 Not Hiding (In Room)<br />2:43 Not Hiding (Dark Room)<br />3:03 Bonked in the Elevator<br />3:29 Bonked Exiting the Elevator<br />3:42 Bonked Entering from the Stairs<br />3:58 Store Room<br />4:25 Another Store Room<br />4:54 Admiring the View<br />5:09 Game Over/Bad Ending<br /><br />If you want to purchase the game you can do so at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1450830/At_Dead_Of_Night/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1450830/At_Dead_Of_Night/</a><br /><br />My Social Media Stuff:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/bnv3V6t">https://discord.gg/bnv3V6t</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CrankyTemplar">https://twitter.com/CrankyTemplar</a><br /><br />#AtDeadOfNight{% endraw %}
