{% raw %}For the first time ever on YouTube (or anywhere) this is the Digital ReMastered version of &quot;Eighth Day&quot; by Hazel O'Connor from the film &quot;Breaking Glass&quot; (taken from the 2012 ReRelease of the DVD) :-)<br /><br />I've taken out the film audio with the crowd clapping and cheering and totally re-dubbed it with the original audio from the single/ cd... :-)<br /><br />Don't think you'll find a better version anywhere on the net (or DVD) than here (unless someone nicks it of course)... ;-){% endraw %}
