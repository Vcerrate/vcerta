{% raw %}Weâ€™re going to show you how you can upgrade an old dining room table to give it a new look using our single items from our store. This kitchen table remodel has no construction required, and the new look is amazing! The table was still strong and sturdy so we painted the legs and coated the table top using our epoxy, dirty pour technique! <br /><br /><br /><br />Get single items here<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rebrand.ly/Epoxy-Single-Items">https://rebrand.ly/Epoxy-Single-Items</a> <br /><br /><br />Some of the things you'll see in this video are<br />0:00 Project intro<br />0:30 Sanding <br />1:03 Painting Legs<br />1:28 Primer<br />1:48 Mixing Epoxy<br />2:26 Pouring Epoxy<br />4:17 Dispersing Effects<br />4:37 Denatured Alcohol<br />4:56 Spray Paint Color<br />6:02 Edges<br />6:22 Urethane Top Coat<br />6:56 Countertop Options<br />7:13 Final Look<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Follow these Hashtags ðŸ‘‡ðŸ¤©<br />#Leggari #LeggariInstallations #LeggariCountertops<br /><br /><br />If youâ€™re not already a Leggari subscriber, click here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/leggari/?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/leggari/?sub_confirmation=1</a> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />About Us:<br />Leggari is a coating based channel (metallic epoxy &amp; concrete overlay) that will show you how you can use our products as amazing DIY projects to transform your existing surfaces!
