{% raw %}As people of God, we have dominion and authority over COVID-19, because Jesus has redeemed us from every curse, which includes sickness, disease and every plague (Galatians 3:13). <br /><br />Kenneth Copeland stands in the office of a prophet of God, and on Sunday, March 29, 2020, he declared that judgment be executed on COVID-19:<br /><br />&quot;In the Name of Jesus, standing in the office of the prophet of God, I execute judgment on you COVID-19. I execute judgment on you, satan, you destroyer, you killer. You get out. I break your power. You get off this nation. I demand judgment on you. I demand. I demand.  <br /><br />&quot;I demand a vaccination to come immediately. I call you done. I call you gone. You come down from your place of authority, destroyer. You come down and you crawl on your belly like God commanded you when He put His foot on your head in the Garden of Eden. You will destroy through COVID-19 no more. <br /><br />'It is finished! It is over! And the United States of America is healed and well again,' saith the mighty Spirit called Peace, who is also the Prince of War, the Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;<br /><br />We must choose to exercise our authority and dominion over COVID-19 with our words. Get into agreement with the prophet, and declare God's judgment on COVID-19. It is defeated in the Name of Jesus!<br /><br />&quot;COVID-19 Over Sooner Than You Think&quot; Prophecy by Kenneth Copeland:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Ys3CrUdxSGM">https://youtu.be/Ys3CrUdxSGM</a>{% endraw %}
