That means you must start making sure that your website's pages get shared on social media, and that you build high quality links pointing to your site.<br /><br />The first part of the off site SEO is relatively simple. You and your team must regularly share the pages of your website on social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and others. You must also get your customers and consumer of your content to share your pages on social media. That happens if you create high quality content, or if you give people some incentive to share your website or pages on social media.<br /><br />The other part of off site and off page SEO is building links from other sites that would point to your site. Building links is a very difficult task. It is especially difficult if you want to build high quality links. You can build high quality links by getting publicity for your business, or by reaching out to bloggers and journalists, and asking them to review your website or product.<br /><br />If you want to learn more about SEO, take a look at my full SEO course:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/seo-with-google-other-large-platforms-to-get-great-scale/">https://www.udemy.com/seo-with-google-other-large-platforms-to-get-great-scale/</a><br /><br />Many marketers obsess about off page SEO and building links. But there is actually quite a bit you can accomplish with on page SEO. My recommendation would be to explore everything you can with your on page strategies, and then go for off site SEO because off site SEO is far more difficult and more time consuming.<br /><br />Best way to create your website: Wordpress vs. Squarespace vs. Weebly:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bJfaFsLMfw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bJfaFsLMfw</a><br /><br />Inbound marketing tutorial:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22TN3OFKwtE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22TN3OFKwtE</a><br /><br />SEO and social media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IwbAJjDAEA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IwbAJjDAEA</a><br /><br />On page SEO tutorial:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-v4QcwyEC0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-v4QcwyEC0</a><br /><br />How to get Google traffic:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaKstfBX2lA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaKstfBX2lA</a><br /><br />How to start a successful YouTube channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqbElmFXZa8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqbElmFXZa8</a><br /><br />Blog commenting for SEO:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejQfUuZsgMc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejQfUuZsgMc</a><br /><br />Content marketing:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3nQQtemUlI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3nQQtemUlI</a><br /><br />SEO social signals and engagement signals:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCm2nyigdn8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCm2nyigdn8</a><br /><br />Introduction to SEO:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy4OQsSNy2Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy4OQsSNy2Q</a><br /><br />Marketing strategies course:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3brrVun7zNI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3brrVun7zNI</a><br /><br />Marketing strategy book to reach 1,000,000 people:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6qbz-qnaPU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6qbz-qnaPU</a><br /><br />SEO history:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujFJcXTdJqU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujFJcXTdJqU</a><br /><br />Blogging, SEO &amp; social media - how to use your blog as a part of your social media marketing strategy:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4AUQZhCDZI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4AUQZhCDZI</a><br /><br />SEO keyword research comparing long tail keywords and short tail keywords<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HQ80HnPnpM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HQ80HnPnpM</a><br /><br />SEO for new websites:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMSb_eD2ZVY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMSb_eD2ZVY</a><br /><br />Non Google SEO: rank in Amazon, app stores, Yelp and eBay<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMdQX4PD4pE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMdQX4PD4pE</a>{% endraw %}
