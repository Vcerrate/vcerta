{% raw %}After a brazen shoplifting inside a Walgreens in San Francisco, the suspected thief and another customer went bananas on each other — literally. The thief was seen behind the counter filling his bag with loot. Then, on the way out, he knocked a cell phone out of another customer’s hand. The two went at it. “What, you want to go?” the suspect says, before throwing a banana from the checkout counter at the other customer. The customer retaliated by throwing more bananas at the thief, hitting him in the back.{% endraw %}
