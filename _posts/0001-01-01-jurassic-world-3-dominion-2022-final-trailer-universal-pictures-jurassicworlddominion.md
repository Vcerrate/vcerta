{% raw %}#JurassicWorldDominion #UniversalPictures #LegendaryPictures<br /><br />Hey, this is Screen Culture's FINAL TRAILER concept for Jurassic World 3: Dominion (2022) which is a sequel to 2018's Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (More info about this video down below!)<br /><br />Let us know what you think about it in the comments down below!<br /><br />We've got more cool stuff for you!

There is a lot that Jurassic World Dominion must do to end the Jurassic World trilogy right. Bringing back the central cast members of the Jurassic Park trilogy is a solid start, but Jurassic World Dominion must also explain away the absurd ending of its franchise predecessor, fix Dr. Grant’s character arc, and provide a satisfying ending to Claire and Owen’s story.<br /><br />Given all the plot threads and character details that Jurassic World Dominion has to juggle, it would seem fair to say that the trilogy-ending sequel should not try to retcon anything from the original Jurassic Park trilogy. After all, there is a lot to clarify without changing details from the earlier franchise as well. However, some of Jurassic Park’s divergences from its source novel still deserve to be fixed, even if it is five movies later.<br /><br /><br />Thank You So Much For Watching!<br />Stay Tuned!
