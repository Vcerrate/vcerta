{% raw %}The ocean is an exciting and mysterious realm home to countless bizarre and often terrifying species, but to experience it all you must be willing to dive in! On this episode of Wild Field Trip, Coyote Peterson helps guest host Taycey Harrison overcome her trepidation of ocean creatures by getting hands on at the Florida Keys Aquarium Encounters. Together, they investigate the creatures that live in different ocean zones, starting with the alien-looking giant isopod, followed by some cool crustaceans in a touch tank! Taking her bravery to the next level, Taycey even aids in the training of some clever sharks and takes the plunge into a tank full of giant stingrays!<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:55 Aquarium Encounters<br />2:30 Giant Isopod<br />7:36 The Sunlight Zone<br />11:47 Sharks<br />16:37 Swimming With Stingrays{% endraw %}
