{% raw %}Hey everyone, today we’re looking at a variety of details throughout Dead by Daylight’s realms. Let’s get into it. <br /><br />Chapter 23 has been released on the PTB! It's Sadako Rising, a licensed chapter releasing in March of 2022. The new killer is named The Onryō, and the new survivor, Yoichi Asakawa! Sadako's gameplay is really fun, and Yoichi's perks seem interesting. I'm looking forward to their release. <br /><br />Check out my 2nd channel for content on other games: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnz3TK9TLt6BhKh-P66srtQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnz3TK9TLt6BhKh-P66srtQ</a><br /><br />Follow me on Twitter @AZHYMOVS for updates and thoughts on various DbD things: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AZHYMOVS">https://twitter.com/AZHYMOVS</a><br /><br />Music used from YouTube Audio Library: <br />The Emperor's Army - Jeremy Blake <br />Clean and Dance - An Jone<br /><br />Hope you enjoy! <br /><br />Dead by Daylight Wiki (very helpful and a ton of cool stuff and secrets on there): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki">https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki</a><br /><br />Some images used were taken from the Resident Evil Wiki, and are used here under fair use: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Resident_Evil_Wiki">https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Resident_Evil_Wiki</a><br /><br />Some footage/images were taken from the following, and are used here under fair use: <br />A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010)<br /><br />Timestamps: <br />Intro: 0:00<br />Behaviour Times 0:06<br />Teddy bears 0:16<br />Concept art 0:34<br />Ironworks calendar 0:42<br />Azarov's Resting Place 1:12<br />Certificate 1:22<br />Gas Heaven chime 1:39<br />Autohaven crusher 1:52<br />Crushed remains 1:57<br />Hamlet 2:05<br />Thompson House bins 2:12<br />A.P.C. luggage 2:28<br />Crotus Prenn tools 2:46<br />No. 12 suitcase 2:51<br />Happy-go Circus 3:00<br />Newspaper article #1 3:08<br />Newspaper article #2 3:21<br />Clown's caravan 3:30<br />Who did the caravan belong to? 3:37<br />Maurice 3:44<br />Steering wheel 3:55<br />Broken sign 4:06<br />Huntress' family 4:19<br />Elk antlers 4:26<br />Crawlspace on Springwood 4:30<br />Nancy Holbrook painting 4:38<br />Schematics and extra masks 4:44<br />03:52:20 4:50<br />Shoji windows and doors 5:00<br />Rin's family 5:16<br />Oni shrine 5:21<br />The missing blade 5:29<br />Yamaoka family crest 5:34<br />Sanctum statues 5:39<br />Legion mural 5:48<br />Resort graffiti 5:53<br />Mount Ormond Resort leaflet 6:04<br />The Shape's knife in the saloon 6:30<br />Fallen chair 6:40<br />Saloon piano 6:48<br />Midwich crying 6:53<br />Locker shaking 7:00<br />Brad Vickers 7:06<br />Safe room music 7:19<br />Leon's desk 7:38<br />Jill's number 7:42<br />RPD Helicopter 7:46<br />Eyrie outer walls 7:57<br />New Holland 8:03<br />Aethiopic Ocean 8:19<br />Carmina's artwork 8:32<br />Outro 8:38{% endraw %}
