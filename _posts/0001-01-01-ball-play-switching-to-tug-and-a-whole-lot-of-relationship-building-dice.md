{% raw %}Dice is much stronger for the tug than the ball - that makes sense because I have spent so much energy building up his tug.  Here I'm working hard to get him to bring the ball back by treating it like a tug toy - then a little throw - and then back to the tug games he already knows.  But most important is the play and personal interaction which we do together.{% endraw %}
