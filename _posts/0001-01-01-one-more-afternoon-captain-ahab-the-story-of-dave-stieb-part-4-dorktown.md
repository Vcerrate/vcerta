{% raw %}The end of Dave Stieb’s career was as poetic, fascinating, and shocking as the rest of it. To this day, we debate what it all meant, and where his legacy belongs. But long before he hung up his cleats, he told us how this would go. He would not go quietly. It would be loud.<br /><br />Written and directed by Jon Bois<br />Written and produced by Alex Rubenstein<br /><br />Correction(s):<br />• At 28:05, Larry Walker’s initial performance on the Hall of Fame ballot is reflected incorrectly, both on screen and in the voiceover. Walker actually received 20.3% of votes on his first ballot, not 10%.<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/Nbabae">http://goo.gl/Nbabae</a> <br />Enter the Secret Base: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sbnation.com/secret-base">http://www.sbnation.com/secret-base</a> <br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/secretbase">https://twitter.com/secretbase</a> <br />Follow us on Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/secretbasesbn">https://www.twitch.tv/secretbasesbn</a> <br />Follow us on Tiktok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@secretbasesbn?">https://www.tiktok.com/@secretbasesbn?</a> <br />Check out our full video catalog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/9pMHRV">http://goo.gl/9pMHRV</a> <br />Visit our playlists: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/NvpZFF">http://goo.gl/NvpZFF</a> <br />Explore SB Nation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sbnation.com">http://www.sbnation.com</a>{% endraw %}
