You assume that a certain standard of maintenance has been carried out that would keep the plane you’re flying on in an airworthy state. Airplanes are made of upwards of millions of individual parts. The failure of any one of them could result in outcomes ranging from negligible and un-noticeable, all the way up catastrophic meaning certain fatal injury. When Air Moorea Fight 1121 left for a very short flight in French Polynesia, its occupants certainly couldn’t have been prepared for what would happen to their plane just moments into the flight.<br /><br />Sources:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bea.aero/docspa/2007/f-qi070809.en/pdf/f-qi070809.en.pdf">https://www.bea.aero/docspa/2007/f-qi070809.en/pdf/f-qi070809.en.pdf</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.vikingair.com/sites/default/files/Viking-Twin-Otter-Series-400-Technical-Specifications-R-01-2018.pdf">https://www.vikingair.com/sites/default/files/Viking-Twin-Otter-Series-400-Technical-Specifications-R-01-2018.pdf</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_KE9gO5sKo&amp;t=91&amp;ab_channel=Viking">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_KE9gO5sKo&amp;t=91&amp;ab_channel=Viking</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070927175426/http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2007/08/10/all-20-aboard-doomed-air-moorea-flight-feared-dead">https://web.archive.org/web/20070927175426/http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2007/08/10/all-20-aboard-doomed-air-moorea-flight-feared-dead</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bea.aero/en/investigation-reports/notified-events/detail/accident-to-the-dhc6-300-off-the-coast-of-the-island-of-moorea-french-polynesia-on-9-august-2007/">https://bea.aero/en/investigation-reports/notified-events/detail/accident-to-the-dhc6-300-off-the-coast-of-the-island-of-moorea-french-polynesia-on-9-august-2007/</a>{% endraw %}
