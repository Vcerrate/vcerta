{% raw %}Essex 9 piece SERIOUS PROBLEM went from this shambolic shambles to a slightly less shambolic outfit after winning this at a sold out 600 capacity Army &amp; Navy in Chelmsford, which lead them on to be managed by Ricky Gervais and Guitarist Jon&quot;Cakes&quot; Benit to be asked to play guitar for The Prodigy. The Probs carried on until 1998 and then have occasionally reformed to embarrass themselves one more time, popular to common myth vocalist Jeremy Grimcock is not &quot;a homeless&quot; and went on to model lawn mowers for Flymo, vocalist Roy Tarmac eyes got closer and closer together over the years, so much so he was locked away as he was seen to be a Cyclops and a pest. Dennis the guitarist put on 17 stone and is now confined to a small shed in barking, cakes and pie became a 2 piece and was last seen at haven holiday village performing as the &quot;new kids from fame&quot;, rapper G-spot got full blown 80s Aids and grew a beard whereas rapper muff diver never got out the eighties and was last seen knocking out snide fila BJs and 8 balls at Canvey Sunday market, and the drummer .... well he play drums doesn't he{% endraw %}
