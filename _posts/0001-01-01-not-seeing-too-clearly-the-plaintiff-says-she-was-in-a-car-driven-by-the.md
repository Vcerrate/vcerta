{% raw %}The plaintiff says she was in a car driven by the defendant and they got into an accident. Her head was cracked open and she had to go to the hospital by ambulance. Her very expensive glasses got left in the car, so sheâ€™s suing for their cost and for a dinner bill. The defendant says she has no idea where the glasses are since the car was junked and she was bedridden for a week herself. <br /><br />Case #24-126{% endraw %}
