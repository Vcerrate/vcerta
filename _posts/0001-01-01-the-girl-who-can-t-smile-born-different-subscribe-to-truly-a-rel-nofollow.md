{% raw %}SUBSCRIBE to Truly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj">http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj</a><br /><br />BRIMMING with positivity, New Zealand based Tayla Clement was born with Moebius syndrome - a type of facial paralysis that means she can't smile. After being bullied throughout her teenage years and never really knowing where she fit in, she found her confidence and decided that her condition would not define her. Now, she is a record breaking paralympian, influencer, motivational speaker and charity ambassador with a mission to show people that no matter what you're going through, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Tayla said: &quot;Moebius syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that affects my sixth and seventh cranial nerves. So, that means that my eyebrows don't move, my eyes don't track from left to right and my upper lip doesn't move which means I can't smile and it's super rare.&quot;<br /><br />TAYLA'S INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/taylaclement/">https://www.instagram.com/taylaclement/</a><br />TAYLA'S TIKTOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@taylaclement">https://www.tiktok.com/@taylaclement</a><br />THE GOOD HUMAN FACTORY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thegoodhumanfactory/">https://www.instagram.com/thegoodhumanfactory/</a><br /><br />Videographer: Jon Bowden<br />Producers: Dan Coles<br />Editor: Tani McDowell<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
