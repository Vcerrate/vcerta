{% raw %}Grace Tame’s snub of Scott Morrison at a pre-Australia Day morning tea was an “own goal,” according to Sky News contributor Erin Molan.<br /><br />“Grace Tame is an incredible human being, she’s been incredibly brave and gone through a living hell and she’s used an experience that was really awful to try and push for change which I have an enormous amount of respect for,” Ms Molan said.  <br /><br />“My question to her would be: ‘What did you want to achieve out of that, Grace?’<br /><br />“I just don’t think that has advanced her cause in any way, and prime example, we’re sitting here now not talking about what she’s done to try and end violence against women.<br /><br />“We’re sitting here talking about Grace Tame’s facial expression, and that’s an own goal in my opinion.”{% endraw %}
