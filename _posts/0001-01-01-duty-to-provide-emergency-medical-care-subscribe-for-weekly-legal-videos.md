LawShelf is a project of National Paralegal College <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nationalparalegal.edu.">https://nationalparalegal.edu.</a><br /><br />The United States medical system, though not without its faults, seeks to ease access to emergency medical care and give provide lifesaving care to those in need. Prior to 1986, private hospital emergency rooms could turn away patients, even if they were in desperate need of medical treatment. Since private hospitals could turn away indigent patients (a practice known as “patient dumping”), public hospitals became overcrowded. To address this issue, Congress passed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (which we’ll refer to as the “Act”) in 1986. This presentation will focus on how the Act’s provisions and requirements have affected patients’ access to emergency medicine. <br /><br />National Paralegal College offers undergraduate programs leading to a paralegal certificate, paralegal associate’s degree, bachelor’s degree in legal studies, bachelor’s degree in business administration, or joint program in legal and business studies. In addition, the graduate division of NPC offers a Master of Science in Legal Studies, a Master of Science in Compliance Law, and a Master of Science in Taxation.
