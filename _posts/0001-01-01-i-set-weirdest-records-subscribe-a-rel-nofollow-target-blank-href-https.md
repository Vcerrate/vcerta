My name is Naomi.<br />I felt overlooked ever since I was a kid. My parents loved my sister Mandy more and always set her as an example. She won a gymnastics competition and our parents decided to throw a party in her honor. A bunch of relatives and friends gathered at our house. Everyone admired Mandy, praised her and gave her gifts. As usual, no one was paying any attention to me. I was terribly bored and decided to ask my boyfriend Brian over. When he came, I felt a bit better, but soon, something terrible happened. The party was in full swing when all the guests went out for a moment. I was drinking juice and accidentally overheard a conversation in the next room. It was Brian talking to my sister.{% endraw %}
