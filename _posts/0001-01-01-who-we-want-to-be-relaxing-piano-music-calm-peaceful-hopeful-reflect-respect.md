{% raw %}Not just another calm and relaxing piano session. As you might know, usually I say my music is to focus or to study better, a soundtrack for mind work, for designing the world of today and tomorrow, for reflecting, coding, getting things done, in the evening when winding down for a healthy sleep, or just to relax and enjoy. This time itâ€™s true, too, but there is more.<br /><br /><br />Title: Who We Want to Be | Type: original fantasia piano music session<br /><br /><br />Last week has been a difficult one for me. To watch a bird eat another one alive brutally is hard to digest. Seems to be part of nature's code though. To watch a human society do this to another is terrifying. What happens in Eastern Europe right now tests us a lot, teaches a lot, hurts a lot. <br /><br />Sitting here in the colors of the oceans and the sun, or the blue sky and yellow wheat fields if you will, I dedicate the music to the People of Ukraine, including anyone touched by the brutality taking place in their land currently, as well as to all humans anywhere on the Planet who must endure violence or suffering of any sort and degree, be it physical, mental, or otherwise. Also I extend the dedication to all species and habitats. <br /><br />As a collective global human race we have a long way to go still, before we reach our true potential. Weâ€™re getting there though. Closer every day and with each and every lesson. One step back, two forward. Iâ€˜m with you.<br /><br />We all want to be alive and feel alive, be part of the whole, see and be seen, develop our full capacity and ourselves, be strong, experience the beauty the world has to offer, feel joy, love, and happiness, feel safe, secure and protected. Let us get there in dignity.<br /><br />Playing what my soul feels, I ask myself and you: What kind of beings do we want to be? Who do we want to be?<br /><br /><br />Be strong, healthy, maybe listen to your heart, enjoy today.<br />Michael (relaxdaily*)<br /><br /><br />ðŸ§¡ You can download the music and help me continue creating more:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/63310057">https://www.patreon.com/posts/63310057</a><br /><br />ðŸ“º Find all my ambient tunes and piano music sessions here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily">https://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily</a> (tick the bell when subscribing if you want to be notified by YouTube about my latest videos)<br /><br />Thank you for listening and creating own playlists also on: <br /><br />ðŸŽ§ @ Spotify <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3F1cI520nPOLkjvHd2k7iz">https://open.spotify.com/artist/3F1cI520nPOLkjvHd2k7iz</a> <br /><br />ðŸŽ§ @ Apple Music<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://music.apple.com/artist/relaxdaily/494543884">https://music.apple.com/artist/relaxdaily/494543884</a> <br /><br />...and selected music services, like YouTube Music, Amazon, Deezer...<br /><br /><br />Some of my YouTube playlists (save for updates):<br /><br />â˜° Calm Piano: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOzlQzU-yr67GDMoL_vHqpXAWIoEoix6k">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOzlQzU-yr67GDMoL_vHqpXAWIoEoix6k</a> <br /><br />â˜° The Singles: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE6EB41B485F610A">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE6EB41B485F610A</a> <br /><br />â˜° Deep Focus: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOzlQzU-yr65nTKt7tEbHBnnd0AiGJoqZ">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOzlQzU-yr65nTKt7tEbHBnnd0AiGJoqZ</a> <br /><br />Â© music &amp; video (2022) relaxdaily.net<br />...stay wonderful!{% endraw %}
