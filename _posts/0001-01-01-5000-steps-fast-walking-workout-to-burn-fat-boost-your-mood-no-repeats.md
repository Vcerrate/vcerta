{% raw %}Looking for good vibes and an intense sweat? Well, you've come to the right place!!<br /><br />Today we are doing things a bit differently. Our intervals of exercise to walk will vary throughout the workout to keep you on your toes, and ready for the next exercise. This will make the workout go quicker and will challenge you in new ways both in endurance and strength.<br /><br />So what I want for you to do, is promise me that you are going to give it your 110% the entire way through. Dont give up a couple seconds before the ding, and keep your head up.<br /><br />Don't forget to keep breathing. This is so important when working out. Not only is breathing how you give your muscles the necessary fuel to complete the exercises, breathing out (via carbon dioxide) is one pathway for fat loss (yes it comes out as you breathe out). So, keep your breathing steady and be mindful of it. Breathing properly can make or break a workout!<br /><br />This workout will challenge the entire body. We start with a 5 minute warm up, then take about 5 minutes each to work on our cardiovascular endurance, upper body, lower body, abs, and finisher (respectively). <br /><br />Don't worry; I have included 2 water breaks in there for you so that we are staying hydrated and feeling our best to give it our best<br /><br />If you stay consistent with these workouts, you are going to see amazing results.
