{% raw %}When we refer to the configuration of a system, we mean the technical description of a system and how its component parts inter-connect. <br />So, what is Configuration Management?<br /><br />We define Configuration Management in our free PM Glossary: ‘Be on the Inside. Decode the Jargon of Project Management’, as:<br /><br />'Defining, controlling, releasing, changing, documenting, and reporting the configuration items in a system.'<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://onlinepmcourses.com/lp/decode-jargon-project-management/">https://onlinepmcourses.com/lp/decode-jargon-project-management/</a><br /><br />We can think of that system as, for example, a technology solution we are implementing, or as the project itself. In the latter case, configuration management concerns itself with the project scope, quality management, and change control.<br /><br />However, most often, we are concerned with the configuration of a solution we are building or adapting within our project. Therefore, configuration management is an important DevOps process - DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations.<br /><br />The purpose of configuration management is to ensure that we can properly track how a system is configured through its whole life, from development to retirement. <br /><br />Without proper configuration management, we cannot build, test, install, accept, operate, maintain or support the system.<br /><br />A big part of it is tracking changes, so we need to collect and structure a lot of data, such as:<br />• Date<br />• Version number<br />• Status<br />• Product owner<br />• Features<br />• Components<br />• Connections and interfaces<br />• Relationships with other products<br /><br />It is beyond our scope to look at the methodologies and how we carry out configuration management. However, I will list the five principal components:<br />• Configuration Management Planning to create your CM plan document<br />• Configuration Identification – establishing and maintaining a baseline configuration against which changes can e tracked and recorded<br />• Configuration Control – like Project Change Control, this is the process of evaluating and accepting or rejecting changes to the configuration<br />• Configuration Status Accounting – recording and reporting on the configuration, as it changes<br />• Configuration Verification and Audit – independent (or quasi-independent) review of processes, artifacts, and compliance<br /><br />As you might expect, there is a big choice of software tools to support configuration management<br /><br />For us, as project managers, we need to ensure that our Project Plans include any configuration management plan. It will be part of your scope management process.<br /><br />Recommended Videos<br />Carefully curated video recommendations for you:<br />What is Project Scope? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/NXw0bvvYWYo">https://youtu.be/NXw0bvvYWYo</a><br />What is ITIL (and ITSM)? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/xsZZuJom5EY">https://youtu.be/xsZZuJom5EY</a><br />What is Release Management? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/dvFQrsY_tKg">https://youtu.be/dvFQrsY_tKg</a><br />What is PMTQ - Project Management Technology Quotient? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9b0xs9rCeks">https://youtu.be/9b0xs9rCeks</a><br /><br />A while back, I asked Project Managers in a couple of forums what material things you need to have, to do your job as a Project Manager.  They responded magnificently.
