{% raw %}Bush speech gaffe: Called Iraq invasion 'unjustified and brutal' instead of Ukraine. In what some are calling a gaffe and an epic 'Freudian slip,' former President George W. Bush accidentally called the invasion of Iraq 'wholly unjustified and brutal' while speaking about Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Bush made the embarrassing gaffe in a speech at his presidential center in Dallas, where he spoke about the importance of fair elections and slammed Russia's autocratic system.Â  'The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia, and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq,' Bush said, before shaking his head and correcting himself. 'I mean, of Ukraine.'<br /><br />#Bush #BushGaffe #Ukraine #Russia #Putin #Iraq #IraqInvasion<br /><br />Original Article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10831671/George-W-Bush-accidentally-calls-Iraq-invasion-unjustified-brutal.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10831671/George-W-Bush-accidentally-calls-Iraq-invasion-unjustified-brutal.html</a><br />Original Video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-2689477/Video-George-W-Bush-mistakenly-says-Iraq-instead-Ukraine-speech.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-2689477/Video-George-W-Bush-mistakenly-says-Iraq-instead-Ukraine-speech.html</a><br /><br />Daily Mail Homepage:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/</a><br /><br />Daily Mail Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/dailymail">https://facebook.com/dailymail</a><br />Daily Mail IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/dailymail">https://instagram.com/dailymail</a><br />Daily Mail Snap: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033">https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033</a><br />Daily Mail Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MailOnline">https://twitter.com/MailOnline</a><br />Daily Mail Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail">https://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail</a><br /><br />Get the free Daily Mail mobile app: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dailymail.co.uk/mobile">https://dailymail.co.uk/mobile</a>{% endraw %}
