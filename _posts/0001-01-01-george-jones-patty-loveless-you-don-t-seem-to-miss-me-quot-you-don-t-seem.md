{% raw %}&quot;You Don't Seem to Miss Me&quot; is a song written by Jim Lauderdale, and recorded by American country music artist Patty Loveless featuring backing vocals from George Jones. It was released in September 1997 as the first single from her album Long Stretch of Lonesome.<br /><br />The song charted for 20 weeks on the Billboard Hot Country Singles and Tracks chart, reaching number 14 during the week of December 13, 1997.<br />Label: Time-Life ‎– M19330 A 704020<br /><br />Patricia Lee Ramey (born January 4, 1957), known professionally as Patty Loveless, is an American country music singer. Since her emergence on the country music scene in late 1986 with her first (self-titled) album, Loveless has been one of the most popular female singers of neotraditional country. She has also recorded albums in the country pop and bluegrass genres. Loveless was born in Pikeville, Kentucky, and raised in Elkhorn City, Kentucky, and Louisville, Kentucky. She rose to stardom thanks to her blend of honky tonk and country-rock and a plaintive, emotional ballad style. Throughout her career, Loveless has sold 15 million albums worldwide.<br /><br />George Glenn Jones (September 12, 1931 – April 26, 2013) was an American musician, singer and songwriter. He achieved international fame for his long list of hit records, including his best-known song &quot;He Stopped Loving Her Today&quot;, as well as his distinctive voice and phrasing. For the last twenty years of his life, Jones was frequently referred to as the greatest living country singer.  Country music scholar Bill Malone writes, &quot;For the two or three minutes consumed by a song, Jones immerses himself so completely in its lyrics, and in the mood it conveys, that the listener can scarcely avoid becoming similarly involved.&quot; Waylon Jennings expressed a similar opinion in his song &quot;It's Alright&quot;: &quot;If we all could sound like we wanted to, we'd all sound like George Jones.&quot; The shape of his nose and facial features earned Jones the nickname &quot;The Possum&quot;. #GeorgeJones #PattyLoveless #YouDontSeemToMissMe #HonkyTonk  #CountryClassic #RonjasCountryMusic #CountryMusic #GuriMalla2010{% endraw %}
