{% raw %}Gifted students have unique needs that are often overlooked in educational settings. We have to be familiar with the myths, research, and strategies surrounding their cognitive, emotional, and social development. <br />I've been sitting on this one for a while. I made it for one of my grad classes and decided I would finally publish it on this channel. Hope it is of some help to someone. <br />Submitted as a final project for PSYC 432G -- Gifted &amp; Creative{% endraw %}
