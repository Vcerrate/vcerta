Sudeep Kumar Agrawal, Corporate Trainer Of Civil Guruji (Civil Engineer Training Institute) is explaining What is Dado ? | Why Dado are used ? | How Dado is helpful ?<br /><br />Dado finish is a thin render of plastering done with cement. It has a smooth finish and looks something like polished concrete once sealed. Crazing (thin surface fractures) typically occurs in a dado finish and are seen as part of the character of the material. The crazing shouldnâ€™t comprimise the strength of the finish. Dado finishes are very durable if done correctly and have a distinct design aesthetic similar to polished concrete without the high dollar and environmental costs.<br /><br />The skirting is the strip of wood that sit in the corner made by the floor and the wall. They are there to protect the bottom of the wall against being damaged by brooms vacs and mops<br />Dados are 4 feet or more in stature , in showers, WCs and in Staircases, on dividers, made of glazy materials like coated porcelain/vitrum tiles. In staircases, even engineered lacquer paints are additionally utilized. In staircases , dados shield the dividers from continuous human contacts and in Bath and W.C, it shields the put dividers from water sprinkles amid washing and showering.<br />This area is given a decorative treatment different from that for the upper part of the wall; for example panelling, wainscoting or lincrusta. The purpose of the dado treatment to a wall is both aesthetic and functional. Historically, the panelling below the dado rail was installed to cover the lower part of the wall which was subject to stains associated with rising damp; additionally it provided protection from furniture and passing traffic. The dado rail itself is sometimes referred to misleadingly as a chair rail, though its function is principally aesthetic and not to protect the wall from chair backs.{% endraw %}
