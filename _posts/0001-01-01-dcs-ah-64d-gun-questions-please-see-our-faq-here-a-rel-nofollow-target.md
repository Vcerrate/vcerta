The AWS consists of the M230E1 30mm chain gun that is mounted under the chin of the helicopter. The official rate of fire is 625 +/- 25 rounds per minute, but this is most often reduced in the field. The gun can transverse 86-degrees left and right, and it can elevate 9-degrees up when within +/- 10 degrees of the aircraft centerline and 11-degrees when outside of +/- 10 degrees of the aircraft centerline. It can traverse down up to 60-degrees. <br /><br />Ammunition types include the M789 High-Explosive Dual Purpose and the M788 practice round. At early access release, the Robbie fuel tank will always be installed, and this results in a maximum gun load of 300 rounds. Later, after Early Access release, we plan to make the Robbie tank optional. This would allow a maximum gun load of 1,200 rounds. The software-supported maximum range is 4,200 meters.{% endraw %}
