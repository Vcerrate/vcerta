{% raw %}While across the pond on my month long Europe trip, I had the pleasure of teaming up with this absolute stud of a lady baller. Crafty hitting, sneaky serves, MOSTLY buttery sets, and an intense competitor.<br /><br />This COED tournament took place on the island of Mallorca in Spain and hosted players from all across the continent.<br /><br />Beyond grateful to have had the chance to travel, compete, and get to know all of these humans. <br /><br />Follow along on instagram @buddyhammon_roundnet for more action.{% endraw %}
