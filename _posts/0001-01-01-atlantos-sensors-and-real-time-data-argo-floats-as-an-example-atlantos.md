{% raw %}AtlantOS: Sensors and real-time data - Argo floats as an example<br /><br />Argo is one of the most important components of in-situ ocean observing systems, complementing ship measurements in many regions. Euro-Argo ERIC, the European component of Argo, provides in-situ ocean observations to various user communities that are interested in the ocean state and its evolution. This European Research Infrastructure aims at maintaining one fourth of the international Argo network and developing its extensions to high latitudes, abyssal ocean and biogeochemistry, hence contributing to fill identified gaps in the Atlantic Ocean Observing System. The European Union's Horizon 2020 project AtlantOS has contributed significantly to the development of the Biogeochemistry- and Deep-Argo networks, particularly in the South Atlantic Ocean.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.atlantos-h2020.eu/">https://www.atlantos-h2020.eu/</a>{% endraw %}
