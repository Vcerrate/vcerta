{% raw %}People with disability must be supported to speak up when a service is not meeting their needs. A service must be able to respond effectively to those needs. <br />ADHC has created a short video for service providers on the benefits of complaints and having a good complaints handling system. It highlights the Feedback and Complaints Management Log (FCML) which is a free online complaints system available to all ADHC funded service providers. <br />This video shares the views of service users, the NSW Ombudsman and testimonials from current FCML users.{% endraw %}
