Analysts thought our economy would grow by 1.1% this first quarter, they didn’t expect for the economy to contract until sometime next year - but we already started because the GDP was -1.4% in the first quarter. This is the beginning of a recession and we are half way there.<br /><br />WORST START OF THE YEAR SINCE 1939<br />Based on the DOW Jones Market data, means that we just had the worst start to the first quarter of the year since 1939. Every investor's portfolio is a sea of red. <br /><br />WHY IS THIS WEEK SO IMPORTANT?<br />Fed meeting will happen on May 4 2022.
