{% raw %}Building an addition to the log cabin for bathroom and sauna on the back side of the cabin. I'll use the same system with the concrete blocks for the foundation as the main cabin structure and then the rest of the structure will be made from logs. The reason for and extension is because I also wanted to build a sauna and inside the cabin it would take too much space. This way I can make a comfortable size bathroom and sauna, and still have it connected to the house as the same building and not having to exit the cabin if I would build a separate outhouse.<br /><br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />Don't forget to subscribe to not miss the future episodes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/rijavecniksubscribe">http://bit.ly/rijavecniksubscribe</a><br /><br />Log Cabin Building End of the Year Recaps:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/LogCabin2019Recap">http://bit.ly/LogCabin2019Recap</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/LogCabin2020Recap">http://bit.ly/LogCabin2020Recap</a><br /><br />Off Grid Log Cabin Playlist:<br />Season 1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/offgridlogcabin">http://bit.ly/offgridlogcabin</a><br />Season 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/offgridlogcabins2">http://bit.ly/offgridlogcabins2</a><br /><br />#nikrijavec #logcabin #offgrid #s3ep16{% endraw %}
