{% raw %}Fresh off the viral success of his last single &quot;Backwords,&quot; Hip-Hop's newest favorite storyteller, Joyner Lucas is back with a compelling new video for &quot;The Long Way,&quot; from his latest mixtape  Along Came Joyner. <br /><br />The East Coast rapper is best known for his gritty song &quot;Ross Cappichioni&quot; and accompanying disturbing visual that graphically reenacts the grisly true story of Capicchioni's near fatal shooting that provided a riveting look at both the shooter and the victim perspective. Although this may be the beginning for the lyrical emcee, we are betting Joyner Lucas is here to stay! Check out the official video premiere below{% endraw %}
