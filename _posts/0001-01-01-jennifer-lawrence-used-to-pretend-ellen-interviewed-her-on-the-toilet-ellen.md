{% raw %}Ellen called her neighbor and new mom, Jennifer Lawrence, who explained how she used to sit on the toilet and pretend Ellen was interviewing her. Now Ellen is asking her questions for real, and what's more, it's come full circle as Jennifer currently lives in the house Ellen lived in when she started the talk show nearly 20 years ago.{% endraw %}
