Trailer mashups are often created for a movie that does not exist now or to change the genre of an existing film. These are derivative works as defined by the United States Copyright Act 17 U.S.C. § 101, and as such, may find protection from copyright claims under the doctrine of fair use.<br />The trailer mashups are not only a user generated form of digital creativity but a way to create anticipation for future releases, working in tandem with current movie trailers. Movie trailers are designed to give minimal plot detail and to create hype and anticipation. Fan made trailer mashups allow the audience to perform their own cinematic spin on current movie footage. This allows the trailer to focus on a specific actor or portion of the film. It could even change the plot or genre of the film entirely.<br />____________________________________________<br /><br />Producer Amy Pascal seemingly walks back on her comments about the development of a new Spider-Man trilogy with Tom Holland in the MCU.<br />Film producer Amy Pascal clarifies her announcement for Spider-Man 4, 5, and 6 with Tom Holland. At the end of November 2021, while doing press for Spider-Man: No Way Home, Pascal surprised everybody when she announced that Sony is continuing their partnership with Marvel Studios for the wall-crawler beyond the upcoming threequel. This excited a lot of fans, but now, she may be walking back on her revelation.<br /><br />Sony was in its second iteration of the friendly neighborhood hero played by Andrew Garfield when The Amazing Spider-Man 2 surprisingly became a disappointment. Instead of moving forward with their plans for The Amazing Spider-Man 3, Kevin Feige was able to convince Sony to share Spider-Man with Marvel Studios in 2015, which led to their historic partnership. Soon, Holland was cast in the role, and by 2016, he joined the MCU through Captain America: Civil War. Since then, he has played the role four more times — two of which were in his solo adventures: Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home.

He's now set to star in his third standalone film, Spider-Man: No Way Home. Spider man new home teaser trailer, spider man 4 new home,spider man no way home,spider man no way home final trailer. While talking to Variety during the Los Angeles premiere of Spider-Man: No Way Home, Pascal gave an uncommitted answer when asked to talk about the supposed plans for a new Spider-Man trilogy in the MCU.

Instead of excitedly teasing narrative possibilities, she was coyer, saying that if it was up to her, Sony and Marvel Studios' partnership will move forward. Pascal's original announcement that a new Spider-Man trilogy was in the works assured fans that the wall-crawler will continue his journey in the MCU.

There's a chance that she might have been so excited about the prospect of Spider-Man 4, 5, and 6 that she prematurely talked about it, and n0w, she is trying to keep people's expectations in check.{% endraw %}
