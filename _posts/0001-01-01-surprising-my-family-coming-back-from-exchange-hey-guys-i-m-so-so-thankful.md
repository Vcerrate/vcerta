{% raw %}Hey guys! I'm so so thankful for all the views I have. This was totally unexpected! Once I hit 1,000 subscribers I will post a new video! Please like and subscribe! It is highly appreciated! <br /><br /><br />P.S: <br />I was an exchange student in the Czech Republic. My friend Julia is from Brazil and she quoted, &quot;Come back to brazil&quot;, what she meant was, &quot;Come visit me in Brazil.&quot; <br /><br />So the plane route was from the Czech Republic to Turkey and then to New York! <br />Thank you all so much for the comments, likes, views, and subscriptions!!! <br />You are all AMAZING!!!<br /><br /><br />CHECK OUT MY NEW VIDEO: COLLEGE LIFE: MY FIRST SEMESTER{% endraw %}
