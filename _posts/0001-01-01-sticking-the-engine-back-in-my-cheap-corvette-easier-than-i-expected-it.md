{% raw %}It's time to stick the drivetrain back into my $3,500 Chevy Corvette. We dropped the entire drivetrain out to make the engine swap easier, and it was the right move. The LS1 came right out and the LS6 dropped right back into the cradle. We spent a bit of time cleaning everything up and dressing the new engine, now it's ready to go back in. So today we're going to roll it back into place, drop the car back onto the drivetrain, then start putting everything back together. Hopefully we're starting this thing up for the first time in short order!<br /><br />MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shopWatchJRGo.com">http://shopWatchJRGo.com</a><br />Shop Motul: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://motul.com">http://motul.com</a><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Common Questions:<br /><br />What motorcycle do I ride?
