{% raw %}Dr. Paul Craig Roberts discusses US-Russia tensions and corona tyranny. He doesn't see how events in Kazakhstan could've been anything else but an attempted color revolution. While prior U.S. administrations in the 20th century worked to defuse tensions with Russia, Washington today is removing safeguards, not taking security talks seriously, and is expanding NATO and military installations.

At the start of the pandemic, he had no reason to question the CDC and NIH. However, over time he began to see holes in the narrative. He believes there must be some sort of conspiracy and can't fathom the level of global coordination going on.
