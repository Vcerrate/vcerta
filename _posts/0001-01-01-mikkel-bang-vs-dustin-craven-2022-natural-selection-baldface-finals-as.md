{% raw %}As the first rider to drop at the TAE Natural Selection at Baldface, Dustin Craven looked cool, calm and collected all day, and when the final came around, it was only him and one other rider left to stand atop the podium. That rider was Mikkel Bang. While Mikkel took the first of two runs, Craven answered back on his final try and took the win over Bang with a commanding top-to-bottom burner that will live on in snowboard history for decades to come. Massive congratulations to Dustin Craven for a huge win at the TAE Natural Selection at Baldface!<br /><br />To learn more visit NaturalSelectionTour.com{% endraw %}
