{% raw %}A vr to the lovely Meg at Rose Honey Ritual. <br /><br />To see Meg’s original video then visit here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/cQBtc1jR4_U">https://youtu.be/cQBtc1jR4_U</a><br /><br />In this video I explore what I think are my deck deal breakers and then proceed to show you decks I love that have them thereby calling my own lack of deal breakers out. <br /><br />Some of these I feel show places I still need to heal like problems with the divine masculine or religious imagery (which in this video I label under the term “Christian” as that’s my background although I do recognise here that this term doesn’t cover it all and all the imagery I was showing). This therefore has been a great process for shadow work, exploring my whys and continuing to point myself forwards towards continued healing. <br /><br />#tarot #oracle #tarotcommunity #tarotvr #nobuy #depthyear{% endraw %}
