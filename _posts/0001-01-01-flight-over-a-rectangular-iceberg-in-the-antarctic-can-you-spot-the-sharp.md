{% raw %}Can you spot the sharp-angled, rectangular iceberg? This footage (partially sped up) is from an Oct. 16, 2018 flight over the northern Antarctic Peninsula by our Operation IceBridge DC-8 aircraft. Mission Scientist John Sonntag provides commentary. More: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.nasa.gov/2JdEy71">https://go.nasa.gov/2JdEy71</a><br /><br />Operation IceBridge is NASAâ€™s longest-running aerial survey of polar ice. During the survey, designed to assess changes in the ice height of several glaciers draining into the Larsen A, B and C embayments, IceBridge senior support scientist Jeremy Harbeck saw a very sharp-angled, tabular iceberg floating among sea ice just off of the Larsen C ice shelf. A photo of the iceberg (seen at right) was widely shared after it was posted on social media.{% endraw %}
