{% raw %}Making something from nothing. Literally rummaging through my scrap wood pile, I figure I can make a little rustic coffee table from my sawmill lumber. I try my hand at wood joinery without any special tools and so far it seems to have worked well!<br /><br />Wanna go fer a rip with me on the ATV and a soak in the hot tub??!?<br /><br />At the end of this video I will let you know what a bit about what will be in the next video ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜Š<br /><br />** Also - Clearly I am not a carpenter, or furniture maker! haha. For some reason the 4x4 pieces of wood fit together better before I planed the sides to be joined. For some reason the planer took off more material at each end, therefore the ends didn't join up as nicely as they did just they way they were. I wish I didn't even use the planer! Any ideas what I was doing wrong?{% endraw %}
