Hip-Hop meets Reggae, Dub, Dancehall and Drum n’ Bass, so it’s both relaxing and explosive at the same time! <br />Highlights on this new release include the ‘trippy’ yet grounded “Problems”, the powerful “Dear Law”, the mantra of empowerment “Acknowledge the Power”, and of course, “A Better Place” itself carries a calm yet unbreakable force! <br /><br />With Kill Emil’s magic music production, and Mamaletta’s unique voice we are all guaranteed to go to a place out far...and then back to ours, to keep trying as much as we can to make it A Better Place.<br /><br />Follow Mamaletta:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/mamaletta">https://www.facebook.com/mamaletta</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/mariletta.ko...">https://www.facebook.com/mariletta.ko...</a><br /><br /><br />Follow Kill Emil:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/KillEmil">https://www.facebook.com/KillEmil</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/kill_emil">https://twitter.com/kill_emil</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/killemil">https://www.youtube.com/user/killemil</a> ... <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://killemil.bandcamp.com">https://killemil.bandcamp.com</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/killemilmusic">https://soundcloud.com/killemilmusic</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mixcloud.com/killemil">https://www.mixcloud.com/killemil</a><br /><br /><br /><br />PRODUCED BY KILL EMIL<br />LYRICS BY MAMALETTA AKA MARILETTA KONSTANTARA<br />MIXED BY KOSTAS PS.K PSATHAS FOR DIGGINSOUNDS<br />MASTERING BY ANGELOS 'TIMEWARP' STOUMPOS<br />VIDEO BY PEDRAM VOSS<br /><br />LYRICS : <br /><br /><br />Don't let troubles get you down, if they put you in a hole!<br /><br />Just have faith in yourself, in now, and just let it all flow!<br /><br />Don't let troubles get you down, cause they come and they go,<br /><br />so if you wanna make it stay positive with your heart and soul!<br /><br /><br />Acknowledge the power that you carry within, <br /><br />take a deep breath, dive in, let it begin!<br /><br />Let it begin again, let the fyah burn till we warm, <br /><br />let it burn till we bring the whole place down        (x2)<br /><br /><br />Two blunts, a full moon, and I'm gone! <br /><br />I'm feeling like there is not enough air in the room!<br /><br />I'm leaving to find a new place, a new face, a new race to run, <br /><br />a new game to plan, a new dawn...<br /><br />Damn I'm feelin' lonely, this one dimension's boring,<br /><br />surrounded by ignorant people who can't see they've been crippled, <br /><br />and they pass it on, with no shame, no doubt, no second thoughts, <br /><br />no filters no nothing at all!<br /><br />Cowards vs Dummies in a fight to death,<br /><br />tryinna prove to each other that their way is the best!<br /><br />You failin' my system!
