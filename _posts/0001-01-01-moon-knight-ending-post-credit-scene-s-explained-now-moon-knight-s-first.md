{% raw %}Now Moon Knight’s first adventure in the MCU ends with way more questions than answers and with this take on the character being a little different from what even Moon Knight fans probably expected, it’s difficult to say exactly where Kevin Feige and Marvel are planning to go with him. We finally got to see the complete trifecta but the ending leaves a lot not only for interpretation but also theories and speculation how where the Egyptian god powered man with an affinity for the moon is going to go next. In this video, we talk about where they might go next, where we could see Moon Knight pop next and just what’s so important about that sarcophagus.<br />Also don’t forget to do all the YouTube things, like hitting the subscribe button, clicking the notification bell and liking the video.
