{% raw %}Turkey is developing a mini attack submarine called the STM-500 to patrol its surrounding coastline and for export. <br />The STM-500,  is 42 meters (138 feet) long, has a submerged displacement of 540 tons and a maximum speed of 18 knots,The submarine can also dive up to 250 meters (820 feet) and has a cruising speed of five knots. The submarine’s diesel engines allow it to travel up to 3500 nautical miles, while its batteries alone can power the craft for up to 75 nautical miles,It can also be fitted with an air-independent propulsion system. extending the vessel’s range to 4000 nautical miles. <br />The STM-500 can also be equipped with an optronic periscope,an electronic warfare support measures antenna and various types of sonar including cylindrical array,cylindrical transducer array and own-noise array systems.<br />The sub can accommodate 18 crewmembers and a six-member special forces team,staying submerged for 30 days, It has four torpedo tubes and can carry eight cruise missiles. <br />mini-submarines are highly effective in littoral operations because they have smaller magnetic and acoustic signatures,making them difficult to detect by enemy sonar. <br />Military commentator Kozan Selcuk Erkan explained to state broadcaster TRT Haber that.the mini-submarine is a powerful, high-range vehicle that will be a game-changer like the country’s indigenous drones. <br />the small  state-of-the-art vessel would allow the military to conduct missions in places such as the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea,with their shallow and enclosed areas.<br />Erkan also noted that developing mini-submarines like the STM-500 could be more challenging than larger craft since many subsystems need to be built smaller. <br />However,  he asserted that such a challenge is something that the country’s shipbuilding industry can handle now.<br />Once developed and tested,Turkish officials believe the platform could attract the attention of countries that want cutting-edge underwater systems but lack the budget to procure.{% endraw %}
