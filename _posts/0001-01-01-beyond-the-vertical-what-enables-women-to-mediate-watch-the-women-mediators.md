{% raw %}Watch the Women Mediators Across the Commonwealth (WMC) network and Conciliation Resources for the launch of their joint report Beyond the Vertical: What Enables Women Mediators to Mediate.<br /><br />Drawing from the experiences of WMC network members, this report demonstrates how a complex mix of factors such as regional and local networks, positive visibility, intergenerational collaboration, effective peer-to-peer learning, flexible funding, responsive donors, and supportive and inclusive institutional cultures can contribute to constructing enabling environments for women mediators. It highlights both the immense value of women mediators, as well as the urgent need for their greater inclusion and recognition, including in formal mediation processes.<br /><br />The event focuses on sharing and discussing the key findings of the report and what works to support women mediators. Rather than just exploring the barriers that women mediators face, we will ask the audience to consider what they can and should do to support the participation of women mediators.{% endraw %}
