{% raw %}This episode is sponsored by Chiggerex.<br /><br />In this episode, Coyote’s eaten alive by the world’s deadliest animal: the mosquito. Mosquito bites can leave behind much more than an itchy, swollen welt. These bloodsucking insects carry diseases responsible for more than 1,000,000 deaths each and every year. Is Coyote any match for 1000 of these notorious parasites? It’s time to put his forearm to the test.<br /><br />At Brave Wilderness, when it comes to quickly soothing our itchy painful bug bites, nothing beats Chiggerex. For over 50 years, their unique formula with active ingredient benzocaine, soothing aloe vera and red-reducing chamomile has helped generations of people find relief.
