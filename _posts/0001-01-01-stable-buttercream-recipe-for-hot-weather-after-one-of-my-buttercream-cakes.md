{% raw %}After one of my buttercream cakes melted at an outdoor party, I set out to find the perfect buttercream recipe for hot weather that tastes great while withstanding the heat. I tried four different buttercream recipes and conducted the ultimate heat test experiment and this video shows what happened. Here's more detailed info and a printable version of my new favorite heat stable buttercream recipe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sugarandsparrow.com/buttercream-recipe-for-hot-weather/">https://sugarandsparrow.com/buttercream-recipe-for-hot-weather/</a> <br /><br />Products mentioned:<br />High Ratio Shortening: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3C2Ks4U">https://amzn.to/3C2Ks4U</a><br />Meringue Powder: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ty8wcV">https://amzn.to/3ty8wcV</a> <br /><br />Heat Stable Vanilla Buttercream Recipe: <br /><br />½ cup (113g) unsalted butter, room temperature<br />½ cup (100g) high ratio shortening <br />3 1/2 cups (420g) powdered sugar, sifted<br />1 Tbsp meringue powder<br />2 tsp vanilla extract <br />2 Tbsp whole milk or heavy whipping cream, room temperature<br />1/4 tsp salt, or to taste<br /><br />With a hand mixer or paddle attachment on your stand mixer, cream the butter and shortening on medium-high until it’s creamy and light (almost white) in color. About 7 minutes. <br /><br />Whisk the meringue powder into the powdered sugar. Then, with the mixer on low, add the meringue/powdered sugar mixture one cup at a time, scraping down after each addition and making sure each cup is fully incorporated before adding the next one.<br /><br />Add the vanilla, milk, and salt and mix on low for another minute until fully incorporated. <br /><br />For more cake recipes and decorating tutorials, visit my blog at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://sugarandsparrow.com/">http://sugarandsparrow.com/</a>{% endraw %}
