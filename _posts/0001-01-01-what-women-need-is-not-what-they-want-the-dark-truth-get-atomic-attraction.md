{% raw %}Get Atomic Attraction (Audiobook/Kindle/Paperback): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/atomic-attraction/">https://www.developattraction.com/atomic-attraction/</a><br /><br />You’ll often hear jilted men scream in frustration: “What about me? I gave you everything you asked for. I was there for you and I loved you with all my heart. No other guy will love you like I do or care about you the same way.” What these men fail to realize is that women aren’t looking for men to give them what they want, they’re looking for men to give them what they need. Given a choice between the two, a woman will always choose to be with the man who gives her what she needs.<br /><br />When you’re with a woman, you must pay careful attention to her behavior. If a woman tells you that she’s changed her mind about the relationship and now just wants to be friends, it’s tempting to take the woman’s words at face value and believe what she says. Another example is when a woman pulls out the ever-present, yet well-worn cliché: “I’m not looking for a relationship, I just want to hang out.” Once again, the temptation is to acquiesce and take the woman’s words at face value. Of course, women don’t just want to be friends; they need sex and intimacy like everyone else. It’s your job to give a woman what she needs, not what she wants. This is a lot easier to do when you ask yourself one simple question: what is the strongest course of action I can take?<br /><br />A woman might tell you that she’ll cut you off and punish you for not listening to her, or for not giving in to her demands, but you mustn’t let her threats affect you or derail you because you understand one vital truth: when you exhibit strength, she will always come back. Few men can remain strong and resilient in the face of a woman’s demands—you must be the exception.<br /><br />If you want to maintain attraction with a woman, right from the moment you first meet her all the way through to a long-term relationship, then I highly recommend you get a copy of my book Atomic Attraction.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/atomic-attraction/">https://www.developattraction.com/atomic-attraction/</a><br /><br />Check out the Get Her Back (Action Plan) for the best way to get your girlfriend back if she's pulled away from you or left you.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/get-her-back/">https://www.developattraction.com/get-her-back/</a><br /><br />Please click the link below to make a donation to support my work via PayPal:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=FAD82HTR5UJ36">https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=FAD82HTR5UJ36</a><br /><br />Click the link below if you need Emergency Email/Skype support:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/emergency-help/">https://www.developattraction.com/emergency-help/</a><br /><br />Click the link below to send me an email or visit my website (DevelopAttraction.com):<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/">https://www.developattraction.com/</a><br /><br />Trust yourself and trust the process,<br /><br />Chris Canwell{% endraw %}
