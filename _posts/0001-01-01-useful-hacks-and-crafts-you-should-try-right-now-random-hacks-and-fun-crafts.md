{% raw %}Random hacks and fun crafts you will love<br /><br /><br /><br />Hello, crafters! In this video, you will find unusual hacks and DIY ideas you can easily repeat. Let's start with some winter DIYs. We will show you how to make boots out of foil (you can actually wear them inside your regular shoes, to make your legs feel warmer when it's too cold outside). Then you will see a fun DIY idea for pet owners. You can make a small but super cute igloo for your pets :) <br /><br />Grab your 3D pen, we will show you a bunch of fun crafts you will love! Use a 3D pen to create an excellent photo stand to make your room cozier. A 3D pen can also be used to make jewelry pieces, and you will see the earrings tutorial in the video. In addition, you will find some helpful bathroom hacks and cleaning tips to keep your place sparkling clean. <br /><br /><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br /><br />00:09 - DIY igloo for your pet<br /><br />02:00 - DIY photo stand<br /><br />06:29 - Smart soap hack<br /><br />07:28 - Easy recipe for cheese lovers<br /><br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
