{% raw %}Michelle is a two-time speed-skating Olympic athlete, mother, entrepreneur, innovator and YouEQ’s cofounding master trainer. <br /><br />As an Olympian, she reached a career-high ranking of 5th in the world. <br /><br />Ultimately, health challenges forced her into an early retirement. <br /><br />However harsh, this reality became the basis for what is now her life’s work.<br /><br /> As a parent of two high-performance athletes, Michelle was faced with a huge heartbreak when her sone developed crippling anxiety. Unable to attend school, unable to attend to many of the activities of daily of life, left her son at risk. <br /><br />That is until neuro-gamification came into her world with brain training for emotional intelligence. <br /><br />Now Michelle works directly to certify YouEQ tutors to ensure that every child, parent, school, and boardroom can have access to the transformational benefits of neuro-gamification.<br /><br />Links: BecomingGenuine.com{% endraw %}
