{% raw %}Explaining why I quit Draw a Box about a year ago and why I'm coming back for more even though I have to start the whole process over again. I also go through some of my thoughts on my experiences with the first few lessons in Draw a Box (superimposed lines, ghosted lines, and ghosted planes). For more information on starting for the first time and first thoughts/impressions, I recommend checking out my earlier videos when I was a younger, more innocent artist lmao.
