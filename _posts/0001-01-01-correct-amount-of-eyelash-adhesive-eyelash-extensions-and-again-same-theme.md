{% raw %}And again same theme -why I never swipe residue of adhesive on tissue(never on eyepads) !!! Simple-because we need fresh adhesive to have good retention,by dabing or swiping off we can swipe too much adhesive,also if you used to swipe on eyepad,think of the fumes which goes in to the clients eyes ! www.flawlesslashesproducts.co.uk{% endraw %}
