{% raw %}Spearfishing the Mercury Islands off the coast of the Coromandel Peninsula, New Zealand. We go out hunting for Yellowtail Kingfish and any other fish species we wish to take home. After two hard days diving we are pretty buggered and decide to head out wide to troll for Marlin in the deep blue!<br /><br />A very successful and fun day out once again on the water!<br /><br />#marlinfishing #spearfishing #ocean{% endraw %}
