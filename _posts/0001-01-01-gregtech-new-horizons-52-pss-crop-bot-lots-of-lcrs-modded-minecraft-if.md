But first we upgrade our power storage capabilities with the addition of the PSS. This allows us to store billions of EU and distribute it along the upgraded 4x VG cable we now have as a backbone throughout the base. Next we upgrade the blast furnace coils to HSS-S, now that we have access to Osmium, and fix our shortage of Hydrogen. After building out all the multiblocks to finish the quests we work on a little project turning the outputs of our farm into more usable materials. <br /><br />00:00 Breeks Joins Us!<br />03:05 A Big Battery<br />08:52 Osmium, Palladium, Rhodium &amp; Ruridit<br />15:00 HSS-S<br />17:04 Fixing Hydrogen<br />21:09 Farm Processing{% endraw %}
