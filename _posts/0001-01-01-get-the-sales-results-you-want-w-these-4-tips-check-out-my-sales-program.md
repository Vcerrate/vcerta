And whether you get to close one or get rejected, someone is always going to make the sale. If you sell, youâ€™re the one who gets the sales results. If not, it means your customer sold you on the idea that you can't help them.<br /><br />So, what does that mean for you? You HAVE to really know how to sell. If you let your prospect sell you, youâ€™ve lost. Period. <br /><br />Today, I share the 4 THINGS you need to do to make sure that you sell to them and not the other way around. <br /><br />First, you canâ€™t make the sale if you don't know more about your company than your customer does. Be an expert in all things having to do with your product and your competitors.<br /><br />Second, to get sales results, you need to learn about your prospect. You shouldn't have to ask questions about them when you show up. Do your homework.<br /><br />Third, use more questions. Two ears, one mouth, keep it in proportion. Ask questions and listen, that way the prospect will do the selling for you.<br /><br />Lastly, I also share with you the DUMBEST question in sales that you can ever ask, so you can absolutely avoid it! I also talk about what type of questions to ask instead.<br /><br />If you want to be the one to make the sale, write these tips down and put them into action. The more you put these into practice, the more sales results youâ€™ll see.{% endraw %}
