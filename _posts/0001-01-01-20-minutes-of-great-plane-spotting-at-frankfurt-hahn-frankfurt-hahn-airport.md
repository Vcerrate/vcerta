{% raw %}Featured Aircraft: A320s, A330s, A340s, B747s, 767s &amp; B777s!<br /><br />Frankfurt Hahn Airport, despite the name, resides around 100kms away from Frankfurt itself and is used as a freight hub by various different airlines. You can see Silkway West, Skygates, Atlas Air and Magma Aviation sending their 747s to Hahn on a regular basis along with a lot of other airlines that turn up here and there!<br /><br />I filmed all these clips on my recent trip to Europe, back in September of 2021. I stayed close to Frankfurt and would constantly visit Hahn Airport whenever anything noteworthy would visit the airport. The airport offers some wonderful areas around the perimeter of the airport to record from. There's great cinematic views of the runways, aprons and taxiways that can be explored. <br /><br />This video contains a lot of different angles and cool aircraft that i managed to film. A few cool planes I did include in this compilation is the AirX Airbus A340-600 which was based out of Hahn during the time I was there, it now has been registered and flying for Air Atlanta, serving the lucrative freight market of Asia and North America. Also included is an Atlas 767, which was providing humanitarian flights between the USA and Kabel. Hahn was a fuel stop for the flights! <br /><br />Help support me! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HDMelbourneAviation/membership">https://www.youtube.com/c/HDMelbourneAviation/membership</a><br /><br />Without further ado, I hope you enjoy! <br /><br />_____________________________________________________________<br /><br />FEATURED AIRCRAFT<br /><br />00:00 | AirX World Cargo Airbus A340-600 Takeoff to Hong Kong<br />00:45 | Silkway West Airlines Boeing 747-400F Landing from Vienna <br />01:15 | Lauda Airbus A320-200 Landing from Zagreb <br />01:42 | Atlas Air Boeing 767-300 Landing from Kuwait City<br />02:38 | Magma Cargo Boeing 747-400F Takeoff to New York<br />03:24 | Sky Gates Boeing 747-400F Landing from Novosibirsk<br />04:40 | Atlas Air Boeing 747-400F Landing from Greenvale <br />05:30 | Atlas Air Boeing 767-300 Takeoff to Portsmouth <br />05:57 | Nordwind Boeing 777-200ER Landing from Moscow  <br />09:15 | Silkway West Airlines Boeing 747-400F Takeoff to Baku<br />10:02 | Lauda Airbus A320-200 Landing from Zagreb <br />11:42 | Aerotranscargo Boeing 747-400F Takeoff to Brussels  <br />13:18 | Sky Gates Boeing 747-400F Takeoff to Novosibirsk<br />14:10 | Delta Airlines Airbus A330-300 Landing from Atlanta<br />14:40 | WizzAir Airbus A320-200 Landing from Tuzla <br />15:00 | KLM Cargo Boeing 747-400F Landing from Amsterdam  <br /><br />_____________________________________________________________<br /><br />LOCATIONS<br /><br />Airport: Frankfurt Hahn Airport [HHN/EDFH]<br />Country: Germany<br /><br />_____________________________________________________________<br /><br />EQUIPMENT<br /><br />Camera: Sony RX10<br />External Mic: Rode VideoMic Pro + Deadbeat<br />Editing Software: Adobe Premier Pro CC <br />Tripod: Libec LX7 Tripod System <br /><br />_____________________________________________________________<br /><br />SOCIAL MEDIA<br /><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/HDMelbourneAviation/">https://www.facebook.com/HDMelbourneAviation/</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hd_melbourne_aviation/">https://www.instagram.com/hd_melbourne_aviation/</a><br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />This footage is property of HD Melbourne Aviation and can not be used without permission from HD Melbourne Aviation.{% endraw %}
