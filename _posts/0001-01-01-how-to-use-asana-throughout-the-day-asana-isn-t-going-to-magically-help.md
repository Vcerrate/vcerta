{% raw %}Asana isn't going to magically help you to be more productive. A tool like this is only as good as HOW you choose to use it. When a team is adopting Asana, they really need to adopt a few key habits and routines.<br /><br />In this video, I share some of the habits and routines I use when using Asana on a daily basis. These include:<br /><br />• Use your My Tasks page to focus on what you need to do today<br />• When you open Asana first thing each day, sort your My Tasks into the order you'd like to work on them.<br />• You can create sections for prioritising your tasks or morning/afternoon.<br />• Check your inbox for new comments or updates.<br />• Forward emails to Asana so you can manage everything in one place.<br />• Schedule time for tasks on the calendar.<br />• At the end of the day, update the date date of tasks you didn't have time for.<br /><br />Want to become an Asana Master?
