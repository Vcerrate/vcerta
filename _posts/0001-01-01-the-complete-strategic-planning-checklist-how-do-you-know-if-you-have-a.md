{% raw %}How do you know if you have a complete strategic plan? Our strategic planning checklist will walk you through the steps starting with your mission statement, connecting your vision to your goals, and creating an overall complete plan.<br /><br />First, we need to gather the items that create a strategic direction. This list is composed of your mission statement (why you exist), values statement, and vision statement (where you’re going). Due to its comprehensive nature, a values statement naturally deserves its own process and does not have to be included in your strategic plan.  <br /><br />Next, we have to articulate a strategy. In order to do this, we need to understand where we are today by performing a SWOT analysis. Once you’ve gathered this information, you can begin building your strategy framework by identifying strategic goals, an organization-wide strategy, and a growth strategy.<br /><br />Finally, we can identify an annual plan. Your plan will consist of your organization’s objectives, two to three annual initiatives, quarterly actions, and key performance indicators (KPIs). <br /><br />Using a strategic planning checklist helps to organize, extract useful information, and craft a well-functioning strategic plan.
