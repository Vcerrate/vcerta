{% raw %}Flume feat. MAY-A - Say Nothing (Official Music Video)<br /><br />&quot;This song is about feelings of post relationship clarity. We wrote the song midway through 2020 while the pandemic was still pretty new. I was really excited about the initial idea but it was only once I got back to Australia in early 2021 and linked up in the studio with MAY-A that the song really came to life.&quot; - Flume<br /><br /><br />Pre-Order my new album, ‘Palaces’: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://flu.me/Palaces">http://flu.me/Palaces</a><br />Sign up for touring updates at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://flumemusic.com">http://flumemusic.com</a><br /><br />'Say Nothing' feat.
