{% raw %}Convalesce &quot;Redemptus&quot; Official Music Video, taken out of Consequences EP.<br />This video was written, directed and edited by David and Elston Borges (vocalist/drummer) at Efileno Arts and Media. Lyrics. (How does it feel to be trapped inside your own consequences, there's no way out, pull your self together now. You'll have to wait it out this time, there is no turning back now. One thing's for sure, you will surely make it out alive. Now it's up to you to change your life and turn this all around. I write this to you my brother, with love and full of hope. Redemption comes within Him. So give it all to the redeemer, just give it all just give in. Open your eyes to see the light of the sun again. That warm sensation of a love that will never end. Because you'll be so much more, you could be so much more. Just go ahead and take a step and make this life worth living. How does it feel to not even know what you have become, you've lost your touch, lost your self again.  I write this to you my brother, with love and full of hope. Redemption comes within Him. So give it all to the redeemer, just give it all just give in. Open your eyes to see the light of the sun again. That warm sensation of a love that will never end. Because you'll be so much more, you could be so much more. Just go ahead and take a step and make this life worth living. Rejoice rejoice my brother, for there is a second chance, resurrected by His fire, for He will make you whole again. Rejoice rejoice my brother, for there is a second chance, resurrected by His fire, for He will make you whole again. Don't give up, for you will make it out alive. Don't loose hope, for He will never let you GO! Don't give up, you'll make it out alive. Don't loose hope, He'll never let you go.{% endraw %}
