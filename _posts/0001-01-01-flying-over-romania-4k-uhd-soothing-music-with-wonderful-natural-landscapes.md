{% raw %}Welcome to Earth Relaxation !<br />Romania, country of southeastern Europe. Romania is the twelfth-largest country in Europe, and the sixth-most populous member state of the European Union. The national capital is Bucharest. The Romanian landscape is approximately one-third mountainous and one-third forested, with the remainder made up of hills and plains. The climate is temperate and marked by four distinct seasons. Romania‚Äôs location in the southeastern portion of the European continent gives it a climate that is transitional between temperate regions and the harsher extremes of the continental interior. Romania enjoys four seasons, though there is a rapid transition from winter to summer. Autumn is frequently longer, with dry warm weather from September to late November.<br />Music has so many benefits, and one of them is that it calms your nerves down. It's always a good idea to listen to some background music while you're doing something.
