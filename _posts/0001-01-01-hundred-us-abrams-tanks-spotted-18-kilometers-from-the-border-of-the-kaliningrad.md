{% raw %}Dozens of American M1A2 Abrams tanks spotted 18 kilometers from the border of the Kaliningrad region.<br />The United States has deployed several dozen M18A1 Abrams tanks 2 kilometers from the Russian border.<br /><br />A few hours ago, on the territory of the Polish city of Korshe, about 18 kilometers from the border with the Kaliningrad region, several trains were seen with American M1A2 Abrams heavy tanks, tracked armored personnel carriers of an unidentified type and repair equipment. The accumulation of NATO military equipment has been observed for the third day, while at the moment it remains unknown where exactly the American armored vehicles are going.<br /><br />On the presented video frames you can see one of the trains seen near the borders of the Kaliningrad region. You can see 13 M1A2 Abrams tanks and 2 M88 armored recovery vehicles on it. Despite the relatively small size of the train, this is far from the first echelon with equipment being transferred to the border with Russia.<br /><br />According to a number of assumptions, American military equipment can also be deployed on the border with Belarus, however, recently the activity of NATO forces near the Belarusian border, with the exception of reconnaissance aircraft, has not been observed.<br /><br />Experts believe that against the background of such an escalation, Russia may transfer additional troops to the Kaliningrad region.{% endraw %}
