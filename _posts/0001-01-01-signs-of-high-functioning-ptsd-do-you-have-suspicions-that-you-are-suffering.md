{% raw %}Do you have suspicions that you are suffering from PTSD, but are not exactly sure? Maybe you are unsure if what you went through qualifies as traumatic, or perhaps you have doubts as to whether you have PTSD because you are still able to go throughout your day and fulfil tasks and responsibilities. Perhaps you have seen cases of PTSD in others (whether in person or in media), and have thought that what you go through is not as severe, invalidating your own feelings. Here are a few signs of high functioning PTSD.<br /><br />Please reach out to a qualified healthcare provider or mental health professional if you are struggling.
