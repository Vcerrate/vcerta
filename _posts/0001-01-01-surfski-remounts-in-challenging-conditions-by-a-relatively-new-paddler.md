{% raw %}After watching lots of remount videos and having practised a few (but no where near enough) remounts on my new Boost LV I had some wonderful unexpected opportunities to remount in choppy conditions.  I thought it might be of use to share the ones that went well and the ones that did not in the hope that my hard learnt lessons may help another.<br /><br />#CarbonologySport<br />#BoostLV<br />#SurfSki<br />#Remount{% endraw %}
