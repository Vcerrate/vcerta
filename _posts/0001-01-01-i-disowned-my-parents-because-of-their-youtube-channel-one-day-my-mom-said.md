{% raw %}One day, my mom said to me,  “Honey, there’s something I need to talk to you about.  Your dad and I have made a decision.  We’ve been wastin away at our boring job for years,  so from now on, we only want to do fun things.  We’re going to work for ourselves but also have fun.” This was a great idea.  Of course, I supported them.  But unfortunately, it didn’t go the way they planned.{% endraw %}
