{% raw %}“SHUT UP! STOP BEING FAT! STOP BEING UGLY!” -An ancient proverb, probably. Also a quote from the one and only Alex Pierce, AKA @HRHCollection on YouTube. <br /><br />You may recognize her as the girl that sits in her Mercedes and screams at her subscribers while brushing her hair and eating potatoes. While Alex Pierce may come across as a stereotypical SoCal girl, she’s really anything but. She’s not afraid to call out tyrannical big government, losers wearing their masks in their cars, people who “don’t get the vibe” or fatties. You either love her or you absolutely hate her, but one thing is for sure: you’re definitely going to be entertained. Get your notes ready, it’s time for class. Alex HRH talks her divorce, motherhood, Skinny Fridge, her relationship with God, and MORE. <br /><br />Peep the swear jar in the corner. IYKYK. <br /><br />New episodes of ‘The Spillover’ post every Friday at Midnight Eastern. Subscribe and comment or you’re ugly.{% endraw %}
