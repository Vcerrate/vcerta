{% raw %}Donald Trump, Jr. reposted a video of himself and Republican Senate candidate Eric Greitens with the duo firing semi-automatic weapons and warning &quot;Liberals beware.&quot; Some people have reported the video as a clear threat against those on the left. But one of the bigger issues is the fact that Greitens has been accused by his wife of abusing, physically and psychologically, her and their children. Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins discusses this. <br /><br />Link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jr-guns-ad-liberals_n_62679042e4b0d0774864b57a">https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jr-guns-ad-liberals_n_62679042e4b0d0774864b57a</a><br /><br /><br />Become a member today!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join</a><br /><br />Support us by becoming a monthly patron on Patreon, and help keep progressive media alive!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire">https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire</a><br /><br />Find our merchandise at Teespring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store">https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store</a><br /><br />Spread the word!

Eric greets from Missouri, where the two were shooting off semiautomatic pistols. And at one point in the video, you know, in between the shooting, Trump Jr says striking fear into the hearts of liberals, everywhere. Folks, to which greets responds liberals, beware <br /><br />Liberals beware. So you got two morons with guns, shooting guns, turning around to the camera saying liberals beware. We're striking fear into the hearts of liberals everywhere. I don't know about you, but to me that is 100% a threat, right? If you're actively shooting firearms and then you turn around and say that a certain group needs to be where yeah, that's pretty much a threat in my book. And of course, plenty of people on social media did report this as threat. Of course, nothing ever happens to these individuals, but here's the bigger problem we have here. Mr. Greets is not just some weirdo Republican candidate running for office. No greets of course, was the governor of Missouri had to step down after sexual assault allegations. And in his current campaign, he has been accused by his former wife of abuse, not just abusing her, but also abusing the children. <br /><br />Oh, and not just physical abuse, but psychological abuse as well. So greats has been accused of physical and psychological abuse against the ex-wife and the children. And this has been well known. You know, these allegations have been out there for quite a while right now, but Donald Trump Jr. Looks at that and says, Hey, I know this guy has been incredibly accused of beating the crap out of his wife, beating his kids. This is the kind of guy I want to go and shoot guns with and issue a threat to liberals everywhere. Right? Because y'all are the manly men be eating up women and. Right? That's what a real man does beating up kids. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought Republicans were all up in arms about trying to protect kids in this country. Isn't that why you're doing all the things you do. So why is Donald Trump Jr. Hanging out with a guy that has been accused of psychologically and physically abusing his children? Huh? I, it doesn't apply to everyone, right? You only wanna protect kids from imaginary threats, not real ones. This video is disturbing. Trump Jr's behavior is as always disturbing greeting's behavior. What he has been accused of is disturbing. And the fact that Trump Jr saw nothing wrong with going and shooting guns with this guy that should tell you everything you need to know about the values of not just junior, but of the entire Trump family. This is who they are. These are the kinds of people they embrace. And I'm willing to bet. There's probably a reason that they're attracted to so many people that have been accused of similar behavior.{% endraw %}
