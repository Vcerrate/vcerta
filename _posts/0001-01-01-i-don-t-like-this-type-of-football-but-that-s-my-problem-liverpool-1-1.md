{% raw %}Jurgen Klopp criticises Antonio Conte's tactics as Tottenham dent Liverpool's title chances with a 1-1 draw at Anfield<br />TIMESTAMPS<br />0:00 Intro<br />0:05 We knew what would happen, first 25 minutes amazing, it was clear with 1 mistake they could counter. We could have showed more initiative, we increased pressure without opening up too much. Little moments we aren't anticipating certain things when they happen - like square balls. Game plan of Spurs worked and it was difficult to play them <br />3:15 It is an important point: one point more than we had. Favourite scenario - us and City lose all our games and it stays like this. We will go again. The boys are more disappointed than I am. Slightly better decision making in key moments.. could have won, could have lost. <br />4:55 Konate? I am delighted with all of the boys - but he is a kid playing in this position, but very pleased. Went with him because of his pace to deal with counter <br />6:05  I would love to sit here and say City would drop points but I can't see it. We will see what happens! Not exactly what we wanted but we will deal with it. We will be ready for Villa - it'll be tough  7:35 I don't like this type (defensive) football so not really my problem... World class players and they defended well. I respect it but not my type of football <br />8:15 Dressing room atmosphere? .We need to stop behaving like it's a funeral - we will overcome this. We will prepare and try - just need to keep winning<br />HaytersTV â€“ Football Up Close.
