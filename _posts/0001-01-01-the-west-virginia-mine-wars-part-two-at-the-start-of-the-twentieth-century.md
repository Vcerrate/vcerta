{% raw %}At the start of the twentieth century, a protracted and violent struggle between coal miners and their bosses gripped West Virginia. This was a struggle that often broke out into open warfare, involving company spies, bombs and the biggest armed uprising in the US since the Civil War.<br /><br />We speak with Catherine Moore and others from the West Virginia Mine Wars Museum, as well as some West Virginia teachers who had just been on strike about the conflicts, and how they are remembered today.<br /><br />Our podcast is brought to you by our patreon supporters.
