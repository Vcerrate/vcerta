{% raw %}If you want to find the best hotel in the Maldives for House Reef snorkeling, here are our 2 favorites which you can find in this 4K video : <br />1) Vakkaru<br />2) Six Senses Laamu<br /><br />These 2 hotels in the Maldives offer the best snorkeling with their beautiful house reef full of a wide variety of fishes, sharks, rays, turtles,... <br /><br />In this video, you'll have : <br />Vakkaru Maldives Snorkeling 0:00 - 3:17<br />Six Senses Laamu Snorkeling 3:18 - 6:12<br />Bonus with Snorkeling with Mantas at Hanifaru Bay 6:13 - 7:36<br /><br />Vakkaru offers the best house reef for Snorkeling in the Maldives in 2021. Even though quite some corals are dead (like in many other places in the Maldives), it's still home to thousands of beautiful fishes. <br /><br />Six Senses Laamu also offers a very interesting House Reef for Snorkeling in the Maldives. Meters from your villa you'll be able to see tons of fishes and beautiful corals. <br /><br />When we went to Vakkaru, we had the chance to do Snorkeling with Manta Rays at Hanifaru Bay, a Unesco biosphere reserve in Baa Atoll and were very lucky to snorkel with more than 100 Manta rays. Be sure to try the experience if you're around Hanifaru Bay, it's definitely worth it for a memorable snorkeling with Mantas in the Maldives. <br /><br />We hope that you enjoyed this video with the 2 best hotels for house reef snorkeling in the Maldives in 2021.
