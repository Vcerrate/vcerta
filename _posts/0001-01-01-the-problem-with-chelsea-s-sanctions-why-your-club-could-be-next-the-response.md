{% raw %}The response to Roman Abramovich having his assets frozen, and Chelsea therefore being hit with some very heavy sanctions, has been mixed.<br /><br />Chelsea fans are gutted, some opposition supporters are gleeful, meanwhile others have pointed out the obvious absurdity of Chelsea being sanctioned during the exact same season that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia acquired Newcastle United.<br /><br />In this video, HITC Sevens takes a look at why Chelsea's crisis might not be unique to the Champions League winners, how football and the Premier League in particular has become so fragile, and what - if anything - can be done about it.{% endraw %}
