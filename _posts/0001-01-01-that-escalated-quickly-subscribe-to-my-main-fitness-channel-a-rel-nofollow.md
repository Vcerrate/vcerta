Guys will start off with the intention of doing a relatively clean bulk and keeping their calorie intake under control. But since muscle growth is a fairly slow process, they quickly start losing patience a few weeks or months in and the calories spiral out of control along with it. Before they know it, what started off as a &quot;lean gaining phase&quot; has transformed into a full blown dirty bulk, and they're now playing the &quot;gain 20 pounds of fat to gain 2 pounds of muscle&quot; game. The problem is that once you get past a certain body fat level, it's hard to tell visually just how much of what you're gaining is actually muscle versus fat. It's only when you eventually do a cutting phase that you discover the huge amount of fat you were actually carrying and just how depressing your muscle to fat gain ratio truly was. I remember dreamer bulking all the way up to 227 pounds at 5'9 back in the day when I didn't know better and thinking I was only 20 pounds away from a lean and sculpted 205. In reality it was more than twice that amount that I needed to drop, and even then I still wasn't that lean. Naturally thin guys will often say that they don't mind gaining fat as long as they just get bigger in general (I said the same thing myself), but you'll probably change your mind pretty quickly once you're staring at your newly bloated face and rolls of excess belly fat. If you want to gain muscle at or near your maximum potential while keeping fat gain under control, around 200-300 calories above maintenance is a good range to be in for a clean bulk. (This is just an estimate as it's impossible to track precisely) The visual changes and scale increases will be slower, but you'll look better, feel better and thank yourself in the long run since you won't have to spend months dieting off a bunch of unnecessary fat gain.<br /><br />#fitness #gym #workout #bodybuilding #gains #bulking{% endraw %}
