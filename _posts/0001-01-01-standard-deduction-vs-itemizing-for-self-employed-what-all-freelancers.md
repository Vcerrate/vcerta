{% raw %}A lot of self-employed people are confused about the standard deduction. Did you know that you can take it AND still deduct business expenses? <br /><br />This video dives into the facts every single freelancer should know about the standard deduction. This is the $12,000 tax break that every single American tax filer gets. <br /><br />When it comes to taxes, we tend to talk a lot about taking the standard deduction vs itemizing. But that applies for personal deductions, like charitable donations, property taxes, and medical expenses.<br /><br />If you have less than $12,000â€™s worth of personal deductions, then thereâ€™s no reason to itemize those â€” the standard deduction will save you more on your taxes. Itemized business deductions, though, are entirely separate. If youâ€™re a freelancer, gig worker, or independent contractor, you can write off those expenses ON TOP OF the standard deduction.<br /><br />Why is this so important for freelancers and 1099 contractors to know? Because of how self-employment tax works. If someone who works a W-2 job makes less than $12,000 a year, then the standard deduction makes it so they donâ€™t have to pay income tax on that at all. Your income from self-employment, though, will still be taxed even if you make less than $12,000. The standard deduction wonâ€™t cover you!<br /><br />Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s crucial for all self-employed people to keep track of their business expenses â€” even if they only freelance part-time. Youâ€™re going to be taxed on that income regardless, so you should make sure youâ€™re taking every tax write-off youâ€™re legally entitled to.<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS<br /><br />0:00 - Intro<br />1:29 - What is the standard deduction?<br />2:18 - Understanding personal vs. business deductions<br />4:09 - Tracking your 1099 expenses<br /><br />â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”<br /><br />TAX UNIVERSITY PLAYLIST<br /><br />ðŸ‘‰  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXd4-EMtCcET7053X5KPRz39eahkVS96O">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXd4-EMtCcET7053X5KPRz39eahkVS96O</a> <br /><br />â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”<br /><br />ABOUT US<br /><br />Keeper Tax helps independent contractors and freelancers discover tax deductions and file taxes.
