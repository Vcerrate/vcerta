{% raw %}artist: Oliver De Coque and His Expo '76<br />song: Identity<br />album: Identity - Olumo ORPS 108<br /><br />special thanks for Likembe for posting the files for this music.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://likembe.blogspot.com">http://likembe.blogspot.com</a><br /><br />053109 miami<br /><br />Outreachat - Oliver de Coque played in the mode, perhaps the same key, as Nico Mbarga, down to their extended guitar solo licks. De Coque actually served his apprenticeship with Bongos Ikwue, whose influences were Western and Idoma, with &quot;Zaria&quot; elements thrown in. Mbarga on the hand was of the Oriental Brothers Band-Ikenga Superstars tradition. The single word themes of their major albums, such as Identity, Simplicity, etc., will also be found in juju music as in Sunny Ade's Destiny and Conscience.<br /><br />Norsyk Festus - @Outreachat  Oliver de Coque played the rhythm guitar of simplicity, sweet mother and other tracks on the same album, thats why it seems as if Oliver de Coque and Nico mbarga had a similar soundï»¿{% endraw %}
