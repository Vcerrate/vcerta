Insulation is also added as we go along. We are using 25mm cork insulation which is the same material used in our roof except that has a thickness of 60mm. <br />Using these screws has made the process so much incredibly faster - we highly recommend them!

Along with their cat Ginjey Bear they have been driving around the world in their self converted Sprinter van. However, when the global pandemic hit they began converting their abandoned stone barn in Central Portugal to turn into a wonderful tiny stone cottage. Along the way, they have rescued a playful cat called Furrnando and have a wonderful flock of Chickens!{% endraw %}
