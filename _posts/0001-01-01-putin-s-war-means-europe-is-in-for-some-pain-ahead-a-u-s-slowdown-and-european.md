{% raw %}A U.S. slowdown and European recession are the base case, according to Juliette Declercq, who also thinks Putin's war in Europe is in for some pain ahead, where inflation will remain sticky &amp; prices will stay high.<br /><br />The founder of JDI Research thinks global inflation will remain sticky and that commodity prices will stay high but says a resilient U.S. economy means the world will avoid an entrenched global recession.<br /><br />In this environment, she likes the U.S. dollar and bonds and sees opportunities in equities investments.
