Cheffin up memes in COD to make these videos based on best new loadouts, zombies,  new cod skins, cold war new content and modern warfare new content mixed with memes. ive played COD mobile and most of the CODs, favorites are black ops 2 and Modern Warfare but the new ones are pretty good too. Not as much broken OP as Modern Warfare 2 days but still pretty fun. been gaming for a while, owned playstation 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 but not a single xbox console so I've never played Halo or any other xbox exclusives sadly. watched many movies and animes so i put in those references that shouldn't be mixed with COD but we do it anyway because thats how we do it.<br /><br />#ATTACKONTITAN #CALLOFDUTY #MEMES{% endraw %}
