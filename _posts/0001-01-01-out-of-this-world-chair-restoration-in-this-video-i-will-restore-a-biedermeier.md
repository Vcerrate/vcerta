{% raw %}In this video I will restore a Biedermeier chair. <br />The Biedermeier period was an era in Central Europe between 1815 and 1848 during which the middle class grew in number and the arts appealed to common sensibilities. It began with the Congress of Vienna at the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and ended with the onset of the Revolutions of 1848. I suspect that my chair was made a little bit later.<br /><br />T-shirts and other stuff:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://at-store-25.creator-spring.com/">https://at-store-25.creator-spring.com/</a><br />My music channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TotuCool/videos">https://www.youtube.com/c/TotuCool/videos</a><br />AT Restoration Plus channel:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjjxMSJTfAR3IbCAT25-MbA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjjxMSJTfAR3IbCAT25-MbA</a><br /><br /><br /><br />#howtorestorefurniture #howto  #howtorestore <br />Title: Out-of-this-world CHAIR RESTORATION{% endraw %}
