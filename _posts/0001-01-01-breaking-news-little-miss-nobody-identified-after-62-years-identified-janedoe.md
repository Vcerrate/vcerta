{% raw %}#Identified #JaneDoe #LittleMissNobody<br /><br />“Little Miss Nobody” was a child found deceased in 1960.<br />Her body was found July 31, 1960. She had been discovered in a shallow grave, partially buried at Sand Wash Creek in Arizona. The child had been burned and deceased for about 1-2 weeks.<br />At the scene, investigators documented a set of adult shoe prints, as well as two additional locations of disturbed soil, believed to be failed burial spots.<br />The child was likely a white female, 3 to 5 years old. She had brown hair with a little auburn tint. She had a full set of baby teeth which were in pristine condition. The child was found wearing white shorts, a checkered blouse, and male adult flip-flops that had been cut to fit her foot size and were tightened with brown leather straps; her fingernails and toenails had been painted red.<br />The case gained local and national news coverage but her identity remained unknown, which  is why she was called “Little Miss Nobody”.<br />In 2021, the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office continued their pursuits for an identity by partnering with Othram Inc. They believe they have discovered the identity of the child.<br />A press conference on Tuesday March 15, 2022 will announce their findings.{% endraw %}
