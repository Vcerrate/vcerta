{% raw %}Performed by the Chuiguan and Percussion Ensembles, Raffles Institution Chinese Orchestra and Raffles Junior College Chinese Orchestra | 16.04.16 | Singapore Conference Hall<br /><br />A Well-Matched Fight is a percussion concerto based on the Shanxi piece《撩单子》. The theme is based on the zhendong luo and gu, gong and different layers of drums coming in to form a rich tapestry of rhythmic patterns. The composer makes use of a distinctive and unique style to bring forth a striking combination of percussion and wind instruments. The piece starts with a fanfare, with the percussion setting a lively and fiery mood, following which the main theme enters from the woodwind section and many other sub-themes are brought in. A dynamic percussion solo then takes place with the drums and gongs echoing each other like a well-matched fight between the dragon and the tiger, two symbols of power and might in Chinese tradition. The piece effectively captures the zeal, ardour and boundless optimism of the common Chinese people during festivities and their unyielding might with its vibrant and ebullient qualities.{% endraw %}
