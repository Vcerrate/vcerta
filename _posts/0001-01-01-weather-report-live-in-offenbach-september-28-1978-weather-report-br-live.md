This spring's 1975 Live in Berlin set caught the band beginning to sense its power over a rock audience. Live in Offenbach, from September 1978, features the band that included bass-guitar star Jaco Pastorius. It also included Peter Erskine, a shrewd drummer who helped reintroduce a cooler jazz feel after the critical hammering that had greeted the overcooked, studio-made Mr Gone earlier that year. Stripped down to a quartet, the band sound engaged (particularly the sometimes enigmatic saxist Wayne Shorter), and after the standard early workouts on their hits, they get surprisingly loose and open. Shorter exhibits Sonny Rollins's muscular solo-sax whimsicality on the standard Thanks for the Memory, and Zawinul's wealth of acoustic-piano improv ideas burst out of I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good, while Birdland has a bright, rough-and-ready energy. Pastorius's driving basslines thunder through the music, even if his solo spots tend to emit more heat than light. It's a vivid show from a WR period sometimes considered short of inspiration.{% endraw %}
