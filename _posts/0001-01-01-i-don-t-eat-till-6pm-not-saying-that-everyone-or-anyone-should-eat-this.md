{% raw %}Not saying that everyone or anyone should eat this way, but this is how I've gradually moved towards setting up my diet. <br /><br />This isn't medical advice. Obviously. <br /><br />This also isn't really intermittent fasting, as I do have casein protein in the morning. Don't ask me what brand, it doesn't really fuckin matter. Chocolate. Chocolate brand. <br /><br />Can use code &quot;Geoff10&quot; on any supplement website in existence. I collaborate with all those mothafuckas. It might even work. But probably not. <br /><br />Can grab a copy of my book instead if you enjoy the ad-free content!<br /><br />00:00 Geoff Says Hello<br />00:25 Typical Day<br />02:07 6pm Break Fast<br />02:56 Why Do I Do This?<br />04:07 Are You Hungry?<br />04:54 How Does This Impact Your Performance?<br />06:22 The Best Window?<br />07:18 Is This Healthy/iSn’T tHiS uNhEaLtHy?<br />08:54 Is This Disordered Eating?<br />09:30 Bulking/Cutting<br />11:00 Longevity!<br />12:30 Grab a Copy of My Book it’ll Help a lot!<br /><br />Geoff's Fully Custom Training Plans and One-on-one Mentorship?<br />Email geodude412 (at symbol thingy) yahoo (dot symbol thingy) com<br />Geoff's Book?
