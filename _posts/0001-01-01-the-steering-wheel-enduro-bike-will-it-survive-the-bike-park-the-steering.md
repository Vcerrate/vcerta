{% raw %}The steering wheel enduro bike - Will it survive the bike park? I fit a car steering wheel on my Ghost Enduro mountain bike and see how many gap jumps, MTB trails and drops I can hit in the bikepark, would ride this bike?<br /><br />My ghost enduro mountain bike is a beauty of a bike but now its even better because I have fitted a Momo car steering wheel in place of the handle bars and decided to take it to the amazing Windhill Bike Park to see how many jumps, drops and gaps I can hit with this crazy bike. The steering wheel has been modified to accommodate my back brake so i'm actually able to stop down some of the steep and technical MTB trails on offer at the bike park. I start off by hitting the newest trail in the bike park and hit a HUGE step down gap jump to warm the session up. After this I crusie down some steep downhill trails and jumps lines before meeting Brendog and Deaks for some extra banter! I finish the video off by doing some huge a ridiculous tricks on the biggest jumps in bike park, would you ride this??<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the video!<br /><br /><br /><br />MERCH:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tothesky.store/">https://www.tothesky.store/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br />Welcome to my channel, I'm a professional Freeride Mountain biker and former FMB world champion(2013).  <br /><br /><br /><br />This channel is all about Mountain biking, I make a huge variety of videos for everyone who loves dirt: From downhill biking to slower paced trials riding and everything in between like dirt jumping, slopestyle and enduro!  <br /><br /><br /><br />As well as making entertaining videos(I hope) I also like to help YOU out too, with videos such as:  <br /><br />- How to ride better <br /><br />- Trick tips and How to's <br /><br />- Travel VLOGS <br /><br />- GoPro camera tips <br /><br />- In-depth entertaining features <br /><br />- POV craziness <br /><br />- Funny videos <br /><br /><br /><br /> I also try to reply to everyone so leave some comments too!{% endraw %}
