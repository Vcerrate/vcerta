I don't think anyone will notice.<br />- I think my big divergent observation may not hold! Clarence Lam was the first to spot that the lead n out the front of the series can explain the increasing times without the series itself needing to diverge. I suspect there is still an argument to be made around the rate at which times go up outpacing n, but I’m not sure it’ll be super intuitive.<br />-Let me know if you spot any other mistakes!<br /><br />Early morning filming and editing by Alex Genn-Bash<br />Props by Matt Parker<br />Music by Howard Carter<br />Design by Simon Wright and Adam Robinson<br /><br />English subtitles by Max, Rob Macdonald, Eric Rodríguez and Matt Parker<br /><br />MATT PARKER: Stand-up Mathematician<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://standupmaths.com/">http://standupmaths.com/</a><br />US book: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/610964/humble-pi-by-matt-parker/">https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/610964/humble-pi-by-matt-parker/</a><br />UK book: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mathsgear.co.uk/collections/books/products/humble-pi-signed-paperback">https://mathsgear.co.uk/collections/books/products/humble-pi-signed-paperback</a>{% endraw %}
