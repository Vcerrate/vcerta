{% raw %}10% OFF Quote: ‘Feed the Lion’ (valid 31 May 2022).<br />HALAL STATUS: Fully #Halal.<br /><br />#FtLion review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.feedthelion.co.uk/eggland-new-menu-fitzrovia-london/">https://www.feedthelion.co.uk/eggland-new-menu-fitzrovia-london/</a><br /><br />The first time we visited #Eggland last year, not only were they going by their original name Eggoland, but after rating their hugely impressive menu 4.5/5, their ‘Feeling Decadent’ duck burger went on to win #FtLionAwards ‘Best Burger’ of the year.<br /><br />For those not in the know, the man behind this egg-ceptional restaurant is professional boxer Sohail Ahmad, whose personal journey involving his UK entry in the back of a lorry as a 12-year-old refugee fleeing war-torn Afghanistan is inspiring enough.<br /><br />His 32-cover venue on Tottenham Street in #London’s Fitzrovia was arguably one of 2021’s most publicised openings in the UK’s Halal restaurant sector.{% endraw %}
