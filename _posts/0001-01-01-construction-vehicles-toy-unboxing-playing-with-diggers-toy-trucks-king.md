The adventures of Jack Jack!<br /><br />About us: After witnessing first hand how much our kids enjoy live action playing and checking out toys on our Ipad, we decided it would be a fun family activity to put together a channel that puts our own touch on some of these vids. In front of the camera you will find Jack Jack and sometimes his sidekick dog, Molly May, and big sister Ruthie.<br /><br />We are making videos that showcase both new toys, and well-loved classics from our household. They are a mix of unboxing, toy reviews, parodies, and play time, both at home and outside at our favorite parks.{% endraw %}
