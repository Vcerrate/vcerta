{% raw %}* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *<br />Dallas, Texas — On March 12, 2022, at approximately 2:10 a.m., Dallas officers recognized a known wanted felon at the Vina Game Room located at 12809 Audelia Road. The uniformed officers requested covert deployment officers and Air One for assistance. The suspect, identified as 34-year-old Seth Michael Anderson, left the game room in a 2012 4-door Infiniti. The covert deployment officers followed the suspect into the Everly Apartment complex, located at 9350 Skillman Street. Marked squad cars entered the apartment complex and observed the suspect’s vehicle backed into a parking space. When an officer passed by the suspect’s vehicle, the suspect rammed his squad car. The suspect also struck another squad car, injuring the officer. The suspect fled and a vehicle pursuit ensued through the apartment complex. <br /><br />During the pursuit, the suspect struck another squad car, injuring two additional officers. The suspect drove into a dead end and was boxed in by Officer Noah Hemm’s squad car. The suspect opened the driver’s door, pointed a handgun out of the door, and began firing at Officer Hemm who took cover and returned fire.

Once the officers caught the suspect, he resisted and was tased in order to be taken into custody. Three officers were injured during the incident. The suspect and Officer Hemm were not injured during the gunfight. A total of 38 fired cartridge cases were recovered from the scene. 14 from the suspect and 24 from the officers.<br /><br />Donate to PoliceActivity: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity">https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity</a><br />Like us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PoliceActivity">https://www.facebook.com/PoliceActivity</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Police_Activity">https://twitter.com/Police_Activity</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />0:00 - Dashcam: Officer Hemm<br />2:38 - Bodycam: Officer Hemm{% endraw %}
