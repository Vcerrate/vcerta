{% raw %}Best Player in Clash Royale won 11 Games in a row | SirTagCR - Clash Royale<br />► Subscribe to Me: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/PKrKHx">https://goo.gl/PKrKHx</a><br />► Creator Code: SirTag<br /><br />The best player in clash royale only plays this deck! He went on an 11 game win streak, defeating other top clash royale players with ease. This giant graveyard deck is easy to play, yet capable of being consistent enough to be number 1 in the world. Clash royale pros complain that this pro clash royale player spams giants and graveyards at the bridge and still gets value. The best clash royale player wins vs any matchup with this best giant deck due to its brute force. Even if you have a pekka deck with poison, it's no match for the clash royale best player in the world dropping giant graveyard while they're up elixir. <br /><br />Check out the RoyaleAPI deck stats here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3sIqUQh">https://bit.ly/3sIqUQh</a><br /><br />I stream almost EVERY DAY at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/sirtagcr">https://www.twitch.tv/sirtagcr</a> - typically before 1 PM ET.

I mostly will play miner poison decks, control decks, and decks with any clash royale new cards that are released. The miner is my favorite clash royale legendary card, and I will typically play clash royale miner control decks the most. The decks I play are great for clash royale 12 win grand challenges, clash royale trophy pushing on ladder, and for clash royale tournaments and clan wars. I hope you guys enjoy my pro tips and tricks and my beginner tips and tricks, and I'll see you in the arena!<br /><br />#ClashRoyale #BestClashRoyalePlayer #BestClashRoyaleDeck #Clash #Royale #ClashRoyal #Miner #MinerPoison #hogrider #hog #deck #bestdeck #best #deck{% endraw %}
