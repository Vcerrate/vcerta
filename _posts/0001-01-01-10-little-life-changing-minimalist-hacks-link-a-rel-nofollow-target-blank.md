It makes at-home, delicious coffee about 10x easier, and I can keep it on hand for weeks at a time. I can also prepare it in a variety of ways depending on what I'm in the mood for, so I never get bored of my at-home coffee. So grateful I found this solution! #drinkjavy @javy.coffee <br /><br />DISCLAIMER- Some links found in this description may be affiliate links, meaning I may receive a small commission on purchases you make through my link.
