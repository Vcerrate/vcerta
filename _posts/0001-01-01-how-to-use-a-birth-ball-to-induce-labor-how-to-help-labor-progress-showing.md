{% raw %}Showing you how to use a BIRTH BALL to induce labor and how to help labor progress. Still trying to get labor started? I FEEL YOU!! Learning how to use a birthing ball to induce labor is one of the best and most effective tricks I teach all of my doula clients to incorporate into their routines. Doing yoga ball exercises for pregnancy and stretches during pregnancy will help to keep your ligaments fluid and flexible, your baby engaged in your pelvis, and also just relieve some pressure from your ever changing body! These birthing ball positions to induce labor are great to do when you've reached the 38th week of pregnancy and are full term and ready to go into labor. <br /><br />Leave me a comment and let me know how far along you are! <br /><br />Products Mentioned:<br />☾ My FAVORITE Birth Ball <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2OGham5">https://amzn.to/2OGham5</a> <br /><br />S H O P <br />☾My Amazon Store - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jUMGxw">https://amzn.to/3jUMGxw</a><br />☾My LiketoKnowIt Store - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/LTKharvestmoonnights">https://bit.ly/LTKharvestmoonnights</a><br /><br />Download my F R E E  Home Birth Essentials Checklist here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2TiK12t">https://bit.ly/2TiK12t</a> <br /><br />I know the #1 question I get as a doula is &quot;How can I induce labor naturally&quot;?
