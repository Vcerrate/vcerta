{% raw %}HUES is the new explorative project by German drummer and composer Lukas Akintaya. It was born of the desire to gather and create with some of his favorite musicians whom he met during his stay in New York between 2018 and 2020. The lineup brings together some of the most exciting musicians of the younger contemporary jazz scenes of New York and Berlin and features bassist Simon Jermyn, tenor saxophonist &amp; clarinetist Jeremy Viner and guitarist Keisuke Matsuno. HUES explores genre-transcending territories ranging from contemporary jazz over ambient and experimental indie rock - and electronic influences. <br /><br />You can buy the album here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lukasakintaya.com/store">https://www.lukasakintaya.com/store</a><br /><br />Jeremy Viner – tenor saxophone<br />Keisuke Matsuno – guitar<br />Simon Jermyn – electric bass<br />Elias Stemeseder – synthesizer, fx (on 1,2,3,5,7)<br />Billy Drewes – soprano saxophone (on 2,7)<br />Lukas Akintaya – drums, percussions &amp; compositions<br /><br />- - - <br /><br />Recorded by Joseph Branciforte at Dolan Studio, NYC, May 2019 // Edited and mixed by Joseph Branciforte at Greyfade Studio, Brooklyn // Additional synths recording by Bertram Burkert // Mastered by Philip Gosselin at LeLab Studios, Montréal, Canada<br /><br />© 2021 Lukas Akintaya{% endraw %}
