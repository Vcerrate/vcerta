{% raw %}A legacy that continues to turn heads. The new BMW 3 Series, with updated interior technology and revised exterior, has a choice of drive systems, including plug-in hybrids, for that unmistakably sporty driving experience.  <br /><br />The cockpit has always been at the heart of the 3 Series. Now digitally enhanced with a new BMW Curved Display, a 12.3-inch information display behind the steering wheel, and a control display with a screen diagonal of 14.9 inches create a single fully digital experience. BMW iDrive with the latest generation of BMW Operating System helps extend the digital capabilities of the car for fewer buttons, in favor of touch control and the BMW Personal Assistant. <br /><br />Redesigned headlights and kidney grille maintain the sporty appearance. BMW Performance models from BMW M help the new BMW 3 Series stand out further, with a distinctive honeycomb pattern for the BMW kidney grille and a new design for the front and rear. For the first time, the M Sport package Pro takes that performance look further with touches including M High-gloss Shadowline trim, and an M Sport braking system with red calipers.<br /><br />#THE3 #3Series #BMW <br /><br />BMW 330i Sedan: Combined fuel consumption: 7.4–6.6 l/100 km.
