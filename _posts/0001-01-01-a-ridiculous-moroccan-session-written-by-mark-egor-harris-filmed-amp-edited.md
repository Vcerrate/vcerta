{% raw %}Written by Mark Egor Harris. Filmed &amp; edited by Nick Lloyd. <br /><br />My first ever surf trip abroad was to a secret spot in Morocco when I was 12 years old. I was looked after by Quiksilver and they invited me to a training camp to one of the best waves and at the time best-kept secrets in surfing. An incredible right-hand freight train point break which breaks over sand covered rocks and needs a really big swell in the Atlantic to start pumping perfect tubes down the point. <br /><br />That first trip was a huge eye-opener for a 12-year-old grommet from Fistral beach and also slightly daunting to surf solid heavy grinding tubes for the first time. I remember watching the best surfers in the world including Hawaiian legend Jeff Hakman, Tom Carroll and the best of Europe charging these heavy tubes and I was on the shoulder of the waves ….. jaw side open taking it all in but without the skill, experience or courage to really surf the waves.<br /><br />So 24 Years on in March 2017 the moons aligned, a huge winter swell was in the Atlantic and I was back to visit this incredible wave in Morocco with two very good friends. Unfortunately, our boards and wetsuits did not make it on the plane to Morocco with us and we luckily had to borrow equipment from a surf camp. The next day was perfect, big grinding tubes and with the odds against us, we paddled on our borrowed, unfamiliar equipment try and score a dream wave. After figuring out the line-up and the new equipment I suddenly found myself in the perfect spot for a large set wave …… my heart was pounding. I took off and the borrowed 6’6 board felt nice under my feet and I started to weave through one of the longest most perfect tubes of my life which fell amazing! I rode a wave exactly like how I saw my heroes riding them 24 years before at the Quiksilver training camp.<br /><br />One ridiculous Moroccan drainer!<br /><br />Then in mid-February this year another huge Atlantic swell roared in sending a great looking swell down to Morocco. I booked a last minute flight to meet the swell which lasted four days at the best wave in Morocco. This time my boards arrived with me on the plane and I had new designs to test out on the long perfect walls. It was a really nice week long surf trip to Africa!{% endraw %}
