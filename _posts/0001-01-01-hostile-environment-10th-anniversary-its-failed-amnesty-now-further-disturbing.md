{% raw %}Further disturbing news about the Hostile Environment and the need for an Amnesty or scheme to regularise those in the UK has come out.<br /><br />Apparently, the Hostile environment for immigrants has prevented people from visiting the doctor even if severely ill.<br /><br /><br />The 25th of May 2022 marks the 10-year anniversary since our then Secretary of State and disgraced Prime Minister Theresa May vowed to create a ‘really hostile environment for illegal immigrants’ – and while she failed as a Prime Minister she has certainly made things hostile for the failed “hostile environment”<br /><br />Failed as its purpose was to encourage people to leave voluntarily - something that has not worked as the number of voluntary departures continues to decrease.<br /><br />A report published by the Institute of Public Policy Research provides: “The available evidence suggests that the hostile environment forces people into poverty and destitution, denying them rights to essential goods and services, but it does not necessarily encourage them to leave the UK in greater numbers.&quot;<br /><br />The ‘hostile environment’ has created barriers and divisions in communities, done great harm to individuals and damaged the very fabric of our society. The Government needs to focus on creating fast routes to regularising status and address the inefficiencies in the system rather than punishing people by pursuing hostile, cruel policies.<br /><br />The ‘hostile environment’ over the past decade has created an atmosphere of suspicion and hostility towards migrant communities and has given a license for racial discrimination, as landlords, employers and other unqualified private citizens and public servants have been given responsibility for carrying out immigration checks and acting as gatekeepers to services. Hospitals receiving NHS funds have been told to conduct ID checks on patients before treatment in order to bill them if they are found not eligible for NHS care.<br /><br />There are a whole host of reasons as to why migrants may end up without documentation. Studies show that most undocumented migrants in the UK have come here lawfully and have ended up without proper documentation through no fault of their own – an instance of a college losing their license or a TOEIC allegation could render an ambitious migrant to one who resides in the UK illegally and working cash-in-hand jobs that pay far below minimum wage to make ends meet.<br /><br /><br /><br />If you yourself have been on the receiving end of the hostile environment, then there is almost always something that can be done to help.<br /><br />#amnesty #ukimmigrationamnesty  #lhostileenvironment #covid-19 #echr #paulturner #brexit #feewaiver #amnesty #immigrationscandal #ilr #ho #uktheimmigrationbarrister #uppertribunal #firstiertribunaalrules #ukimmigration #paperhearings #ets #blacklivesmatter #imperiumchambers #pritipatel #ukworkvisa #newpbs #windrush, #coronavirus #borisjohnson #pritipatel#imperiumchambers #ukimmigration #COVID-19 #ukvisacenter #detention #windrushgeneration  #ukimmigrationamnesty #homeofficeracism #racism #ukvisarefusal #ukvisaaccepted #windrushlessonslearned  #highcourt #ukimmigrationdetention #appealscandal #ukvisadone #hodiscrimination #toeic #applicationfeewaiver #omar  #liggison #paulturner #ukvisaappeal #visa #visauk #ukvisa #coronavirus #homeoffice #ukamnesty #ukimmigrationdiscrimination #hopolicies #hocoronavirus #immigrationadvice #ukimmigrationnews #ukimmigrationaappeals #pritipatel #borisjohnson #lowskilledmigrants #nhs #nhsheroes #moderndayslavery #humantrafficking #appg #appgNapier #muslim #pork #quarantinehotel #Albania #kosovo #passport #britishnationality,#deception #igr #intergraduateroute,#student #studentrighttoremain, #datasharing #enforcement #migrantremoval #hoenforcement #jamaica #deportationflight<br /><br />Home office, hostile environment, tier 1, tier 2, 10 years rule, ILR, Hoque, Pathan, long residence, ETS, Toeic, uk immigration advice, uk immigration law, data-sharing, life in UK test, KOLL, visa uk, uk visa, Home Office, Napier barracks, visa, home office, Paul Turner, Imperium Chambers, coronavirus, coronavirus pandemic, Covid-19, amnesty, igr, international graduate route, Jamica, deportation, nationality uk immigration amnesty, priti patel, enforcement, ho enforcement{% endraw %}
