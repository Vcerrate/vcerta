Here I show you how I did the faux leather technique that I recently used on a project I did.<br />Here is a list of the items used:<br />Cardboard, cardstock, paper or whatever substrate you want to add the leather look to.<br />Gesso (which is just a primer, but ordinary acrylic paint will do)<br />Acrylic paint - whatever colour you want your leather<br />Deco Art Crackle Medium - there are other crackle mediums on the market<br />Tim Holtz Distress Paint - I used the colour scattered straw but use whatever colour you want<br />Rub on's or you can use rub -n buff - a wax like consistency.  Viva Decor also does different pots of these finishing wax's<br /><br />Any questions, please leave them in the comments section and I'll do my best to help.<br /><br />Toodles Noodles........Lee x{% endraw %}
