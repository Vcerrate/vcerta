Gracie said: &quot;To do it, I try to over exaggerate ‘mouthing’ the first word, but I won’t add my voice until my mouth is completely still and closed.<br /> &quot;It’s almost like ventriloquism, but the illusion of mouthing the word first, makes it unique.<br /><br />**Please contact licensing@catersnews.com for media / licensing / broadcast usage**<br /><br />SUBMIT A VIDEO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.catersnews.com/submit-content/">https://www.catersnews.com/submit-content/</a><br /><br />Check out more videos like this one:<br /><br />World's Funniest Flight Attendant (Hilarious Viral Video) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfaYKYFYHBk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfaYKYFYHBk</a><br /><br />Dad With Tourettes Becomes A Viral Sensation (Funny Viral tiktok Video) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZercMNGjkbQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZercMNGjkbQ</a><br /><br />Man Dressed As T-Rex Plays With 500LB Alligator <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrnFuhrczyw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrnFuhrczyw</a><br /><br />Connect with Caters:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CatersNews/">https://www.facebook.com/CatersNews/</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://catersmediagroup.com/">https://catersmediagroup.com/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/caters_news/">https://www.instagram.com/caters_news/</a><br /><br />Company Information:<br /><br />Caters Clips is owned and operated by Caters News Agency Ltd, an international multimedia content provider.
