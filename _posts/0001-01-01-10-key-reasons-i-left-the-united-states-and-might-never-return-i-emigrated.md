{% raw %}I emigrated from The United States as a U.S. Citizen to Spain (Europe) 2.5 years ago and I give you 10 reasons why I did so.. Some move to Costa Rica, Mexico, Colombia, or Ecuador, to name a few, but many of the reasons are similar as to why we do.<br />Timestamp &amp; Chapters: 00:00 intro<br />01:42 Healthcare<br />03:29 Minimalism<br />04:17 Acquiring a skill<br />06:50 Climate<br />08:12 Travel Experience<br />09:38 Infrastructure<br />12:19 Social Life/Dating &amp; Food<br />16:58 Cost of Living/Spending Cycle<br />19:30 US Culture and Individualism <br />21:59 Figuring your life out<br />âœ… I maintain my beard with products from: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://westcorkbeardcompany.ie">https://westcorkbeardcompany.ie</a><br /><br />SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL âœ… <br />â–ºPayPal:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/elbell33">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/elbell33</a> (one-time support)<br />â–ºPatreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/AdventureElliot">https://www.patreon.com/AdventureElliot</a> (monthly support)<br /><br />ðŸ’¥Mi Canal en  ESPAÃ‘OL: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKBQ_uDY_UHOHO5h7sMlzUQ/featured">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKBQ_uDY_UHOHO5h7sMlzUQ/featured</a><br /><br />FOLLOW ME ðŸ“¸ <br />â–ºInstagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/adventure_elliot_/?hl=es">https://www.instagram.com/adventure_elliot_/?hl=es</a><br />â–ºFACEBOOK PAGE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AdventureElliot">https://www.facebook.com/AdventureElliot</a><br />â–ºTwitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/elsmith234">https://twitter.com/elsmith234</a><br />â–ºTik tok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMLd6k1HB/">https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMLd6k1HB/</a><br /><br />Adventure Elliot is a bilingual travel vlogger (English and Spanish) with a particular interest in the Spanish speaking world. I enjoy taking adventures - big or small - and my goal is to show the Spanish speaking world 1 video at a time.<br />The goal of my channel is simple yet complex: I want to document and share authentic &amp; educational content of anything related to Adventure Travel, Geography, &amp; Language in the Spanish-speaking world.  It's kind of a loaded topic, but it allows me to never exhaust my creative outlets. The truth is, I've always been extremely passionate about what I'm doing on my channel, but I never properly documented it when I started adventuring as a younger man in my college years. I've made over 150 Youtube videos in both English and Spanish, and I have aspirations to make 1000s more.  If that sounds interesting to you, join the community and follow me along the way.. After all, we're just getting started.<br />#UnitedStates #Expats #Spain{% endraw %}
