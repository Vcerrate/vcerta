{% raw %}It was my fıfteenth birthday. My mom sat me down and said, “Honey, you’re now old enough to know about this. We need to tell you something important. Our family has a big secret and it’s time you found out.” “Ruby, you are not supposed to tell anyone about this family secret of ours. It is really important, honey. Promise?” my dad asked. I nodded. I was so curious. I held my breath and waited. Mom said, “Honey, we’re a family of superheroes. We have superpowers.” Normally, I would laugh. But my parents looked so serious that there was no way this was a joke. With a bewildered expression on my face, I first looked at my dad, then at my mom.{% endraw %}
