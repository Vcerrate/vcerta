{% raw %}Pavandeep Daudher suffered the fatal injury to his leg after being set on by the masked men armed with baseball bats and knives at the BP garage in Lockhurst Lane, Holbrooks, Coventry on the night of 31 March, 2020. <br /><br />Jason Cornwall, 34, Riley Kavanagh, 20, Kane McCarron, 18, and Ethan Lilley, aged 24, all from Coventry, had denied taking part in the fatal attack. But following an eight-week trial that ended in October last year, they were all found guilty of manslaughter.<br /><br />Today Cornwall, of Arundel Road, was jailed for 11 years, while Kavanagh, of Drake Street, and McCarron, of Portsea Close, were both jailed for nine years. During the trial the jury heard that the planned attack was in retaliation after Pavandeepâ€™s friend Zaakir Challoner got into a row in the Cheylesmore area the day before which resulted in a brick being thrown at his silver Audi A3.<br /><br />Our investigations found a threatening text was sent from Lilleyâ€™s phone to a friend of Zaakir saying: â€˜One of your friends will end up in curtainsâ€™ which appears to have been triggered by vandalism at Lilleyâ€™s home in the early hours of 31 March.<br /><br />At around 11pm later that day Zaakir was at the BP garage when a dark grey Ford Kuga on false plates arrived and a group of masked men got out. CCTV showed that they were armed with weapons including baseball bats, poles and knives. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://scarcity-studios.com/2022/01/13/coventrybp/">https://scarcity-studios.com/2022/01/13/coventrybp/</a><br /><br />ðŸ”´ Follow Scarcity on socials ðŸ”´  <br />ðŸŸª Insta: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ScarcityInsta">https://bit.ly/ScarcityInsta</a> ðŸŸª<br />ðŸŸ¥ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ScarcityFB">https://bit.ly/ScarcityFB</a> ðŸŸ¥<br />ðŸŸ¦Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ScarcityTwitter">https://bit.ly/ScarcityTwitter</a> ðŸŸ¦<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scarcity-studios.com">https://www.scarcity-studios.com</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1XI4TFW_nEY4IFfTxUUkCg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1XI4TFW_nEY4IFfTxUUkCg/join</a><br /><br />Alpha Claims and Hire are Birmingham's leading accident management company specialising in non-fault claims. <br /><br />Are you a taxi driver?<br />Have you been involved in a accident?<br />Do you need a accident replacement car?<br /><br />Call us on: 0121 327 0382<br /><br />We stock cars for Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Solihull, Walsall Councils, and many more councils across the UK.<br />Alpha claims and hire stocks euro 6, clean air zone compliant cars. <br /><br /><br />************************************************<br /><br />Alpha claims and hire opened its doors in 2009.
