{% raw %}Pop Quiz! On a scale of 1 to 10, where are you in terms of FLOURISHING? <br /><br />(10 = highest and 1 = lowest)<br /><br />Flourishing is the flow state where we experience positive emotions. <br /><br />It’s when we feel happy, excited, enthusiastic, content, and satisfied. <br /><br />When we are flourishing, we experience positive psychological and social functioning, we are able to problem-solve, and maybe we lose track of time while we are in a state of flow and active engagement.<br /><br />It’s also important to note that ideally, flourishing is meant to be experienced most of the time – not all of the time.<br /><br />So, it’s okay if you’re not always flourishing!
