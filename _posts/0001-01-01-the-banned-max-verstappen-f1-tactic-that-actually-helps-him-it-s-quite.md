{% raw %}It’s quite normal to see Formula 1’s rulemakers outlaw tactics from drivers and teams that they think are unsafe, unfair, or just a bit undesirable. <br />What’s slightly more unusual is for such a ban to actually help the original offender. <br />That’s the case for world champion Max Verstappen, who is no longer allowed to deploy the restart tactic he had used three races in a row - and is being forced to stop doing something that really wasn’t working. <br /><br />#F1 #MaxVerstappen #FIA <br /><br />READ MORE HERE<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://the-race.com/formula-1/fia-outlaws-f1-safety-car-restart-move-used-by-verstappen/">https://the-race.com/formula-1/fia-outlaws-f1-safety-car-restart-move-used-by-verstappen/</a><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://the-race.com/youtube_subscribe">http://the-race.com/youtube_subscribe</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://the-race.com/">http://the-race.com/</a><br />Twitter: @wearetherace<br />Instagram: @wearetherace<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/wearetherace">http://facebook.com/wearetherace</a><br />Podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://the-race.com/podcasts">http://the-race.com/podcasts</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching - please like, share and comment, please also hit subscribe to show your support so we'll keep doing what we're doing.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.the-race.com">https://www.the-race.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/wearetherace">http://www.twitter.com/wearetherace</a>{% endraw %}
