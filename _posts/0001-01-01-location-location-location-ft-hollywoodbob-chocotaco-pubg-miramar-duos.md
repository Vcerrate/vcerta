The chocolate Tacolate will most certainly NOT calm down when he has a Tommy Gun in his hands, thank you very much. And then when he picks up an M4? No calming down. Kar98? Absolutely zero calming down. I mean he's definitely calm, but he's fragging out, sooooooooo yep. In other news, nades are totally fair, Blue Zone Bob is back, and our dear choco always over-estimates how intelligently his opponents will play. You'd think he'd learn, but he's too intelligent for that. We've also got HollywoodBob asking the tough questions here, and a very important lesson about the importance of positioning. Enjoy!  - Beth<br /><br />See choco stream LIVE at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/chocotaco">http://www.twitch.tv/chocotaco</a><br />You can follow his Twitter here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/chocoTaco">https://twitter.com/chocoTaco</a><br /><br />Music: &quot;DuDa&quot; by Ian Post, from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artlist.io/">https://artlist.io/</a><br /><br />Keywords: PUBG gameplay, chocoTaco, #chocoTaco #PUBG #HollywoodBob{% endraw %}
