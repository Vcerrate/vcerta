{% raw %}Newsight’s enhanced Time-of-Flight (eTOF™) solid-state LiDAR is a complete solution for a versatile and affordable 3D mapping device, using Newsight’s patented eTOF™ technology for improved performance. The reference design is highly configurable for different applications and very flexible in coping with different scenarios and environmental conditions.<br /><br />Based on Newsight’s NSI1000 sensor, the eTOF™ LiDAR is specially designed for a wide horizontal field of view (FOV) and a high frame rate. It provides high accuracy and precision with a high dynamic range. The eTOF™ LiDAR will enable LiDAR manufacturers, Tier 1’s, and OEM’s to build a reliable and affordable 3D vision solution for ADAS and autonomous driving.<br /><br />Request a demo or get in contact with us at info@nstimg.com<br /><br />Learn more about the eTOF™ LiDAR features, potential applications and the module components here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nstimg.com/etof-lidar/">https://www.nstimg.com/etof-lidar/</a>{% endraw %}
