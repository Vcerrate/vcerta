Check this out! <br /><br />0:00 Introduction: Grain-fed vs. grass-fed beef<br />0:45 Research on grass-finished vs. grain-finished beef<br />3:19 Findings on grain-finished vs. grass-finished beef<br />7:09 Key points <br />9:05 Check out my video on the healthiest foods you can eat! <br /><br />There is a fascinating research project in place right now on grain-finished vs. grass-finished beef. The project isn't done yet, but there is enough data to conclude that there is a major difference between these two types of beef. <br /><br />The only reason someone would grain-finish an animal is because of cost—they can make more money off of it. But what about the nutrient density of grain-finished and grass-finished beef?<br /><br />First off, a scientist from this research project noted that the muscle meat from a grass-finished cow mimicked a healthy athlete. However, the grain-finished muscle mimicked a person with metabolic syndrome. <br /><br />Grain-finished beef has:<br /> • More inflammatory markers <br /> • Higher uric acid levels<br /> • Higher homocysteine levels<br /> • Higher advanced glycated end products <br /> • Higher amounts of niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3)<br /><br />Grass-finished beef has:<br /> • Higher omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA)<br /> • Higher amount of phytonutrients <br /> • Higher microbial diversity <br /> • Higher amounts of niacin (a form of vitamin B3)<br /> • Higher vitamin C levels <br /> • Higher vitamin E levels <br /> • Higher antitumor biomarkers <br /> • Higher choline<br /> • Higher carnosine <br /><br />Hands down, not only were there more nutrients in the grass-fed, grass-finished beef, there were better metabolic biomarkers—which measure the overall health of the muscle.  <br /><br />After this research is done, they need to do the next level of the study, which is to determine if consuming a healthier animal product makes a difference on a person's health. <br /><br />Keep in mind that something is better than nothing. If you can't do grass-fed, grass-finished beef, it's still good to get on the keto diet. <br /><br />The most important thing is to keep your carbs low. Do what you can, and don't worry about the quality at first. The benefits of doing a low-carb diet are huge. <br /><br />If you can, the next phase to work up to would be increasing the quality of the foods you eat until you get to the point where you're doing the healthy version of the ketogenic diet. <br /><br />ADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description">https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description</a><br /><br />FREE COURSE➜ ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse">http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse</a><br /><br />Talk to a Product Advisor to find the best product for you!<br />Call 1-540-299-1556 with your questions about Dr. Berg's products.
