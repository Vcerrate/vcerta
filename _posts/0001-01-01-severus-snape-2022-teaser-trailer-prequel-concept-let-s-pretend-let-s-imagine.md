{% raw %}LET'S IMAGINE for a minute.<br /><br />How could Warner Bros. continue to explore the iconic Harry Potter property in a cool way (because Fantastic Beasts ain't cuttin' it)? Well, a Harry Potter prequel about Professor Snape starring Adam Driver could be an interesting start.<br /><br />The Harry Potter franchise is packed with so many interesting characters, as well as interesting mythology, and there's so much potential to explore the Wizarding World. We could look into the backstories and origins of Voldemort, Moaning Myrtle, Dumbledore, the Marauders, Sirius Black, Professor McGonagall, Hagrid, etc.<br /><br />Alan Rickman who brilliantly brought Snape to life is untouchable in the role, but I think Adam Driver has a similar vibe/look/voice that would be perfect for young Snape. So this is just a fun lil concept trailer to show what that might look like (I used to be hesitant about them making Harry Potter movies that weren't based on books, but after J.K. Rowling outed herself as a problematic bigot, the series belongs to the fans now). Also maybe a series on HBO Max could be cool.<br /><br />I made the trailer using Universal Studios Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction advertisements, clips from the video game Hogwarts Legacy, clips from Adam Driver's Star Wars movies, and deepfake videos of Adam Driver as Snape.<br /><br />Hope ya enjoyed!{% endraw %}
