Iâ€™m Anthony. Iâ€™m fired up about meeting you where you are in a real, relevant, and relatable way. Here on this YouTube channel, weâ€™ll be having honest conversations about finding our authentic selves by living life based on spiritual, financial, and mental freedom. At the age of 19â€”homeless and deep in debtâ€”I turned my life around by becoming debt-free, and I decided to spend the rest of my life helping people avoid the same money mistakes I made. Today, by the grace of God, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing every day with AO Enterprise.
