{% raw %}Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: “Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all.” — Proverbs 31:28-29<br /><br />It's so appropriate that we land on these words today on the eve of Mother's Day.<br /><br />Fellas, tomorrow I want you to take a moment to tell your mother and the mother's around you, &quot;Happy Mother's Day.&quot; But do me a favor. When you do this, do two things to make it memorable:<br /><br />First, tell her one thing she does better than any other mom.<br />Second, tell her why this means so much to you.<br /><br />She will never forget it. It will easily be the best gift you ever get her.<br /><br />ASK THIS: What does your mom do better than other moms? And why does this mean so much to you?<br /><br />DO THIS: Tell her.<br /><br />PRAY THIS: God, thank you for my mother.<br /><br />PLAY THIS: Isn't She Lovely — Anthem Lights.<br /><br />Check out other all Vince Miller's videos and audios for small groups at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://beresolute.org/">https://beresolute.org/</a><br /><br />Get Vince's most widely read resources The Daily Devotional at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://beresolute.org/mdd">https://beresolute.org/mdd</a><br /><br />Check out more ALL IN products like the one Vince is wearing at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://beresolute.org/product-category/all-in-hats/">https://beresolute.org/product-category/all-in-hats/</a><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Connect with Vince socially:<br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/millervince">https://www.facebook.com/millervince</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/vinceleemiller">https://www.instagram.com/vinceleemiller</a><br />LINKEDIN: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincemiller">https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincemiller</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/vinceleemiller">https://twitter.com/vinceleemiller</a>{% endraw %}
