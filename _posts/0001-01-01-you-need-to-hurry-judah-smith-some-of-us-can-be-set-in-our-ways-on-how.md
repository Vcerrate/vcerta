{% raw %}Some of us can be set in our ways on how we approach life and our relationship with God. Those ways can lead to striving, stress and exhaustion; even climbing our own hypothetical trees to be closer to Jesus, just as Zacchaeus once did. But Jesus wants us to hurry down those trees for a deeper relationship and dependence on him.<br /><br />WHO WE ARE<br />We are a community built on the life and teachings of Jesus. God loves you, and his arms are open wide to welcome people home. Everyone belongs here.<br /><br />CONNECT WITH US<br />Churchome’s Official Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.churchome.org/">https://www.churchome.org/</a><br />Churchome’s Free Mobile App: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://churchomeglobal.app.link/EFnguslTzR">https://churchomeglobal.app.link/EFnguslTzR</a><br /><br />Musicbed Sync ID code:<br />MB013BVKGNAOA0T{% endraw %}
