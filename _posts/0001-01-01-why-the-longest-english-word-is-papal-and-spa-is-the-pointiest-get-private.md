That’s not a joke; legit mistake. I’ve made a real uss of myself.<br />- At 09:57 I say PAPAL averages 13.1cm &quot;per journey&quot; when I should have said &quot;per letter&quot;. Consider this my confession.<br />- At 3:40 I say &quot;So the top 4 rows, now including the letters&quot; but I meant “now including the digits&quot;. But what are digits if not fancy letters? Spotted by Trimutius.<br />- Let me know if you spot any other mistakes!<br /><br />And here are most of the words mentioned in this video:<br /><br />MINIMUM (distance = 248.0mm, angle = 77.4°)<br />DICHLORODIPHENYLTRICHLOROETHANE (distance = 2119.5mm, angle = 1548.0°)<br />ANTIDISESTABLISHMENTARIANISM (distance = 2031.8mm, angle = 1229.3°)<br />SUPERINCOMPREHENSIBLENESS (distance = 1665.5mm, angle = 1090.4°)<br />PALAPALA (distance = 1112.9mm, angle = 19.6°)<br />PAPAL (distance = 655.7mm, angle = 6.5°)<br />PAPA (distance = 503.3mm, angle = 0.0°)<br />AS (distance = 19.1mm, angle = 0.0°)<br />ASS (distance = 19.1mm, angle = 0.0°)<br />POO (distance = 19.1mm, angle = 0.0°)<br />POOP (distance = 38.1mm, angle = 0.0°)<br />DEESS (distance = 43.4mm, angle = 50.9°)<br />WEEDS (distance = 57.7mm, angle = 180.0°)<br />WEEWEE (distance = 57.2mm, angle = 0.0°)<br />WEEWEED (distance = 76.8mm, angle = 104.0°)<br />DISMANTLEMENT (distance = 1124.2mm, angle = 143.3°)<br />SPA (distance = 316.6mm, angle = 0.8°)<br />FUZZ (distance = 162.8mm, angle = 0.9°)<br />GAZOGENE (distance = 523.5mm, angle = 310.3°)<br />SCHIZOGONY (distance = 638.2mm, angle = 407.0°)<br />WAYZGOOSE (distance = 502.8mm, angle = 294.0°)<br />OUTREACH (distance = 255.3mm, angle = 878.2°)<br />ETHMOIDS (distance = 278.4mm, angle = 798.9°)<br />NONMISCHIEVOUSNESS (distance = 965.9mm, angle = 1068.5°)<br />NONSUBSTITUTIONARY (distance = 989.4mm, angle = 1038.4°)<br /><br />Filming and editing by Alex Genn-Bash<br />Props by Lisa Mathers<br />Geogebra by Sam Hartburn<br />Music by Howard Carter<br />Design by Simon Wright and Adam Robinson<br />All typing by Matt Parker<br /><br />MATT PARKER: Stand-up Mathematician<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://standupmaths.com/">http://standupmaths.com/</a><br />US book: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/610964/humble-pi-by-matt-parker/">https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/610964/humble-pi-by-matt-parker/</a><br />UK book: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mathsgear.co.uk/collections/books/products/humble-pi-signed-paperback">https://mathsgear.co.uk/collections/books/products/humble-pi-signed-paperback</a>{% endraw %}
