People who experience ASMR often use it to relax before falling asleep, to relieve anxiety, to help with depression, or to fight against insomnia.<br /><br />There are many ASMRtists out there doing many different kinds of videos. If you are seeking this sensation, I encourage you to keep an open mind and look at various ASMR channels because there are lots of great people producing amazing content! :)<br /><br />What does ASMR mean to me?<br />I‚Äôve been watching ASMR videos for about two years now. I stumbled upon it in one of my favorite Youtuber‚Äôs videos (Stella Rae) and branched out from there. After years of battling with insomnia and anxiety, I had finally found relief through watching these videos.<br /><br /><br /><br />In 2018, I decided to start making my own videos :D I felt it was time to contribute to the ASMR community and help keep it growing because it‚Äôs such a wonderful, positive place that helps millions of people. I know my channel is small now, but putting out my own content is my way of giving back to this amazing community. I‚Äôm Busy B, and thanks for being part of the hive! :){% endraw %}
