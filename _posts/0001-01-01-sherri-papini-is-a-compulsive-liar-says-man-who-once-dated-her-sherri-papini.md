{% raw %}Sherri Papini was charged last week with lying about being kidnapped while jogging and tortured before she managed to break free in 2016. Now, a man who claims he once dated Papini says he’s not a bit surprised she’s in hot water. He also hopes to clear his name following her arrest. “She’s a compulsive liar,” Shauhin Davari told Inside Edition. Davari says he dated Papini when she was a 20-year-old youth counselor, and he was just 15 years old. Now 35, the college professor says Papini’s lies were never-ending.{% endraw %}
