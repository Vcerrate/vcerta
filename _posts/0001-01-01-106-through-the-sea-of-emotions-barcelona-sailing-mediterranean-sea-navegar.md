Moored at its Club Marítim, we take the time to get to know its facilities and learn about its history and sporting tradition of rowing and sailing. <br /><br />Later, we go for a stroll through Barcelona and get lost in its many streets. We stroll along its “ramblas” and contemplate its modern architecture typical of this beautiful city. The good summer weather is with us and we enjoy to the fullest what Barcelona does not want to give away.<br />════════════════════════<br /><br />For Previous YT Episodes: <br />• Season 6 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/vidavela6">https://bit.ly/vidavela6</a> <br />• Season 5 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/vidavela5">https://bit.ly/vidavela5</a> <br />• From the beginning - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/vidaavela0">https://bit.ly/vidaavela0</a><br /><br />Thank you all for the love and support we receive daily.
