{% raw %}Performed by Pink Floyd.<br />Filmed and recorded live at the Nassau Coliseum, Long Island in August 1988 during the 'Momentary Lapse Of Reason' World Tour.<br /><br />In December 2019 Pink Floyd released The Later Years box set. It features newly re-edited version of the 'Delicate Sound Of Thunder' video with newly remixed audio as one of the main features. <br />But unfortunately it wasn't expanded to the full set list concert. Several originally omitted tracks presented there on the bonus Blu-Ray/DVD disc. Also two instrumental compositions remained in shortened form. Unfortunately footage of another two tracks from set list weren't included at all for unknown reasons. I present the expanded edition of this beautiful concert video with all available footage in the right place. This edition expands official 2019 version by 17 minutes.<br /><br />  1.
