{% raw %}We have worked with the Bar Standards Board and CILEx Regulation to develop competences, resources and videos for lawyers who practise in inquests. <br />The Chief Coroner of England and Wales, HHJ Teague QC, and his office, have had input into these materials. The competences will form part of coroner training and coroners will be monitoring how lawyers meet them when they practise in inquests. <br />In this video, the Chief Coroner explains the importance of practising competently in inquests.{% endraw %}
