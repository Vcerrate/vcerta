And all the incorrect information... Watch at your own risk of boredom and possible loss of sanity.<br /><br />The Slightly Shambolic Shuffles are back! This time we visit the 2022 Pride of Longbridge in Birmingham, and it gets very shambolic very quickly. In this fourth part, we crash into both Mr Richardson from the Furiousdriving channel and Alex from Alex's Assets, discuss a Maestro van which I really should not, see lots and lots of yellow MGs, get enthusiastic about parking sensors  and still really experience very little of any importance at all. Nothing untoward, then!<br /><br />A Preliminary Slightly Shambolic Shuffle Ahead of the 2022 Pride of Longbridge! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rgN8GEZ3DJU">https://youtu.be/rgN8GEZ3DJU</a><br />A Slightly Shambolic Shuffle Around The 2022 Pride of Longbridge: Part One of Eight - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9T1zV96frZI">https://youtu.be/9T1zV96frZI</a><br />A Slightly Shambolic Shuffle Around The 2022 Pride of Longbridge: Part Two of Eight - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9Gu8sm1Mv9Q">https://youtu.be/9Gu8sm1Mv9Q</a><br />A Slightly Shambolic Shuffle Around The 2022 Pride of Longbridge: Part Three of Eight - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/O3Vpz5bQgSQ">https://youtu.be/O3Vpz5bQgSQ</a><br />A Slightly Shambolic Shuffle Around The 2022 Pride of Longbridge: Part Five of Eight - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mfIZTF3FjNM">https://youtu.be/mfIZTF3FjNM</a><br /><br />As an independent vehicle consultant, I take potential buyers through the whole car buying process from choosing a make and model to a vehicle handover and road tax.
