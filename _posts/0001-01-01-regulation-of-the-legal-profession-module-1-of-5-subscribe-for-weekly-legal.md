LawShelf is a project of National Paralegal College <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nationalparalegal.edu.">https://nationalparalegal.edu.</a><br /><br />This playlist looks at the responsibilities of legal professionals (mainly lawyers) to defend their clients and to preserve the integrity of the justice system. While the playlist is mainly based on rules applicable to attorneys, non-attorney legal professionals who work with attorneys are also indirectly bound by them, as non-attorney misfeasance can bring severe consequences for supervising attorneys and organizations. The playlist starts with a discussion of admission to practice law. Module 1 covers the requirements for becoming a lawyer, including law school and the bar exam. We’ll also cover the consequences of attorney misconduct and the agencies who are in charge of enforcing the attorney ethics rules. We will also focus heavily on the unauthorized practice of law rules, which are relevant to non-attorneys and to attorneys licensed in other states.<br /><br />National Paralegal College offers undergraduate programs leading to a paralegal certificate, paralegal associate’s degree, bachelor’s degree in legal studies, bachelor’s degree in business administration, or joint program in legal and business studies. In addition, the graduate division of NPC offers a Master of Science in Legal Studies, a Master of Science in Compliance Law, and a Master of Science in Taxation.
