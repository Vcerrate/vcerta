{% raw %}On or around the 17th of October, 79AD, Mount Vesuvius – a volcano in southern Italy – erupted. Ash, dust and poisonous gases were blasted high into the sky, falling like deadly rain on the landscape for miles around. As the eruption entered its second day, all-consuming pyroclastic flows swamped the countryside, submerging and at the same time perfectly preserving the Roman city of Pompeii.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:43 - Background<br />02:34 - The Eruption of Mount Vesuvius<br />08:03 - After the Disaster<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery.
