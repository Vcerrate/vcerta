{% raw %}A viral TikTok video shows a man persistently hitting on a 19-year-old girl while she is trying to work.<br /><br />A college student a Kent State, Mickey Ruiz (@mickey.ruiz), filmed and posted the man’s attempt to hit on her. The video has been viewed over 6 million times. The overlay text asks, “Why do men?” <br /><br />Hey Nikki (a fake name she gave him), can you help me pick out a sticker?” he asks.<br /><br />The unseen man is seemingly older because he’s trying to confirm Ruiz’s education and age. She tells him she’s a 19-year-old college student.{% endraw %}
