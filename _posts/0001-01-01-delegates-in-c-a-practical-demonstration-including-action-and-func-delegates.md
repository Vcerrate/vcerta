{% raw %}Delegates in C# are really powerful, but most people don't know how to use them effectively, if at all. Today I am going to show you what delegates are, how to use them, why they are useful, and really how to take your code to the next level. Along the way, I will cover the special types of delegates named Func and Action. Now if all these new words seem intimidating, don't worry. This topic is actually really simple at its foundation. Yes, you can do some complex things with delegates, but an actual delegate is absolutely simple.<br /><br />Source Code: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=DelegatesInCSharp">https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=DelegatesInCSharp</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/IAmTimCorey">https://patreon.com/IAmTimCorey</a><br />Newsletter signup:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/">https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/</a><br /><br />0:00 - Intro<br />1:28 - Demo application walk-through<br />7:52 - Explaining and creating a Delegate<br />18:19 - Func and Action: problems you can solve with delegates<br />21:37 - Func Delegate: creating and explaining<br />30:56 - Why to have delegate, if all the work is done elsewhere<br />34:00 - Action Delegate: creating and explaining<br />38:07 - Creating anonymous methods: anonymous Delegate<br />43:08 - Creating anonymous methods: anonymous Func<br />45:15 - Creating anonymous methods: anonymous Action<br />49:30 - Using Delegates in other projects: WinForms<br />58:37 - Using Anonymous Delegates in other projects: WinForms<br />1:02:15 - Summary{% endraw %}
