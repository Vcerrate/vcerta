{% raw %}Over the years I have purchased and also sold gold.  Looking back on my stacking journey, I would have done better just to hold all my gold-long term.  In 2018 I started stacking gold again and haven't looked back since.  <br /><br />Inflation has eroded the dollars value.  Gold has been a store of wealth through the ages.  Let's talk about gold and I'll sharer with you what I'm planning on stacking for gold now and in the future!<br /><br />Please leave a comment in the comment section, I do make an efforts to reply to all comments!  As always, thank you so much for watching!- SS{% endraw %}
