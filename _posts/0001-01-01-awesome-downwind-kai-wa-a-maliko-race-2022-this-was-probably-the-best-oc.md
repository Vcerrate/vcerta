{% raw %}This was probably the best OC race since the pandemic started.  An amazing number of OC-1 / OC-2 and surfskis  came for the famous Maliko downwinder.  We had awesome conditions, windy, lots of bumps, good weather, happy people.  The conditions was perfect - challenging but not out of control, so everyone could have fun.<br /><br />There is a blank space at the end of the video - for the Eggers Ohana, and for all the friends and family we loose both inside and outside of the canoe, and for all the people who sacrifice their lives to protect ours -  a small space and time to remember and celebrate their lives.  <br /><br />Thank you as always to the Sponsors, MPH &amp; Staff, voluneeters and participants who make these events possible.  Thanks to Dowling for the escort, chasing down the paddlers.  Thank you also to Tony Martie , who donated the some awesome time lapse and drone footage for the event.<br /><br />#oc1 #oc2 #surfski #mykaiwaalife #kaiwaastrong{% endraw %}
