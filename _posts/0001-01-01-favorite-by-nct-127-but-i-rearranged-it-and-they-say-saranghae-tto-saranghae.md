{% raw %}i know this is super late but this has been in my laptop ever since the mv came out and i never got to redo it bc i didn't like my edit on it at all LOL (i posted a shitty one a few months back) so i decided to finally finish it again today and i still don't know if i like it but hey i finally finished it<br /><br />DISCLAIMER BEFORE YOU COMMENT: this video is made with absolutely no ill intent whatsoever. the original is already amazing on its own, and will always be the best. if you’re new to this channel, i have been rearranging nct songs for a while now out of mere entertainment and nothing else. i do not wish to butcher the professional production of these songs by the company and i am in no way trying to make these tracks sound “better” at all (even tho i can never anyways) <br /><br />ALSO REMEMBER: i am merely rearranging/re-editing what is ALREADY THERE, i am not a producer and/or professional editor i am an nctzen (who loves music soso much) just like everyone else and as much as i love and appreciate ur comments, yall are too sweet and nice it makes me cry bc i don’t deserve that much credit<br /><br /><br />------<br /><br /><br />this wouldn't be possible if it weren't for the creators who uploaded/made the instrumentals and acapellas of the song so full credits go to them !!<br />I OWN NOTHING BUT THE EDIT !!<br /><br />Favorite official instrumental: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnv4Mr9nJRk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnv4Mr9nJRk</a> (uploaded by oncezen mixes)<br />Favorite acapella: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1UKmwS1Mtg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1UKmwS1Mtg</a> (made &amp; uploaded by <br />oncezen mixes)<br /><br />that bit of him talking about the song was from his most recent IG live!! <br />u can watch it here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/4eo_kyjCrSg">https://youtu.be/4eo_kyjCrSg</a><br /><br />--<br /><br />i apologize again for not uploading as much as i used to, have been super busy and drained with a lot of things recently and i've been so in and out of everything lol anyways i hope you're all doing well as always !! ♡´･ᴗ･`♡{% endraw %}
