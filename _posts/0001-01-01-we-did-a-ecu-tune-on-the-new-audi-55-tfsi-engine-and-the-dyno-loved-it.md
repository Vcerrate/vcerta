{% raw %}The Audi 3.0L turbocharged engine has made tuning fun again from the 4 ring car company.  However up until recently, many were unable to tune the Bosch MG1 ECU.  This is now possible from VR Tuned!  This new engine has huge capabilities compared to the previous 3.0L supercharged version.  The new V6 turbo is found in many of the Audi platforms like the Audi S4 | S5.  We just so happen to have the new Audi Q8.  Coming stock with 335HP, we ran this on the dyno and added our VR Tuned ECU flash to see some gains.<br /><br />Get your VR Tuned ECU Flash here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.vrtuned.com">https://www.vrtuned.com</a><br /><br />Follow us on Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/vrtuned">https://www.instagram.com/vrtuned</a><br /><br />Shop all Performance Parts - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.vividracing.com">https://www.vividracing.com</a>{% endraw %}
