{% raw %}This video is about using TextAlign command, complete with all its options and applications. Every option and its use is thoroughly explained.<br />This command saves a lot of time as the options within the command execute multiple tasks in one go.<br />Moreover irrespective of different text height, different text justification we can align the text independently of these constraints. <br />The inherent text justification does not affect the text alignment. <br />Vertical, Angular, Horizontal alignment options make the task of group alignment a lot more easier.<br />I sincerely hope that this will be useful to people seeking the video explanation of this command.
