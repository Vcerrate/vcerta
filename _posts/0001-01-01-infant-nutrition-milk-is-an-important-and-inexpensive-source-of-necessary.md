{% raw %}Milk is an important and inexpensive source of necessary fats, protein, calcium, and vitamins A and D. After one year of age, you can make the switch from breastmilk or formula to regular milk. Just be sure to give your child whole milk. Children under the age of two need the fat calories whole milk offers. Once your child reaches two years of age, you should switch to fat-free, or low-fat milk.{% endraw %}
