{% raw %}Jane Goodall is considered the world’s foremost expert on chimpanzees. She spent over 55 years studying them, gaining their trust, and learning their intimate lifestyles. She taught the world chimps are creatures to be admired, setting the tone for future researchers.<br />Not long into her studies, she founded the Jane Goodall Institute, which not only cares for chimpanzees, but also works extensively with other animal welfare groups. But, chimpanzees were where Goodall’s passion lied.{% endraw %}
