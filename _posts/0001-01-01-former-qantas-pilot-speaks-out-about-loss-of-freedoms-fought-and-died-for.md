{% raw %}It seems we have unavoidably given away freedoms in Australia that were fought and died for, says former Qantas pilot Graham Hood.<br /><br />Mr Hood stressed many protesters are not against the COVID preventative treatment but are against the government's mandate which has resulted in a loss to their livelihood. <br /><br />&quot;This isn't about who is jabbed and who isn't – this is about freedom – freedoms that have been lost,&quot; Mr Hood told Sky News Australia.<br /><br />&quot;These are not anti-vaxxers, these are people who are fighting for freedom that governments are taking away.&quot;{% endraw %}
