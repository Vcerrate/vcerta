{% raw %}Welcome to Harry Potter Theory. Today we're discussing EXCITING news regarding the upcoming third installment of Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore. <br /><br />Earlier today, on the official Fantastic Beasts Twitter page, actor Jude Law (who plays DUMBLEDORE) spoke on camera about the upcoming film, revealing new information.<br /><br />The first proper trailer for Fantastic Beasts came out this December- Dec 13th to be exact, and since then we’re yet to see any new content regarding the film. This is surprising, particularly as the release of the film is less than 2 MONTHS away. That feels amazing to say, particularly with all of the setbacks that the Fantastic Beasts franchise has gone through so far.<br /><br />...Watch the video for the rest!<br /><br /><br />MYTHOLOGY CHANNEL<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNO5DyuBpWRlWwTjqaP6RQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNO5DyuBpWRlWwTjqaP6RQ</a><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVqoigIqNacy9xMnEDZzN_Q/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVqoigIqNacy9xMnEDZzN_Q/join</a><br /><br />Please LIKE / SUBSCRIBE / SHARE to support the channel<br /><br />Leave your video ideas down below!<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hptheory/">https://www.instagram.com/hptheory/</a><br /><br />Tok - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@harry_potter_theory">https://www.tiktok.com/@harry_potter_theory</a><br /><br />All content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and “transformative” purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
