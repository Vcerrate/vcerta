{% raw %}10 Worst Towns in the United States<br /><br />Want to buy some real estate in a small town that doesn’t suck? Me too. What is going on everyone?<br />Let’s take a look at something we haven’t done in a while. Worst towns in the United States.<br />We did this video back in 2017, and I figure it is time for an update. Things have changed, some towns have gotten better some decent towns have gotten worse and Alaska is slowly becoming the new Mississippi. <br />Shockingly Mississippi didn’t make this year's list. If I would have done 25 they would have the 23rd 21st and 13th spots.  <br />  Cities are slowly falling out of fashion and more and more people are looking outside the city and the suburbs. I’m mean honestly if you don’t have to, why would you live in bumper-to-bumper traffic, worry about your safety in and out of your house, or watch your ring doorbell cam while stealing your Amazon.<br /><br />Today we are looking at towns you shouldn’t move to because they are horrible.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Join to help support this channel: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCecPJBL6E1PVky1-gj6KH5g/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCecPJBL6E1PVky1-gj6KH5g/join</a><br /><br />🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹<br /> 🔶My Other Channels: <br />    🟥  On This Day  <br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs9MGJ6xVKLKG_YsQkQNLjg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs9MGJ6xVKLKG_YsQkQNLjg</a><br />    🌍 Our website:<br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.worldaccordingtobriggs.com/">https://www.worldaccordingtobriggs.com/</a><br />   <br /><br /><br />  <br />#UnitedStates<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />❤Things You should watch or listen to:<br />    👍 Hermens Outdoors:<br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgEIwkmBTuhy6Djx6XipM3g">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgEIwkmBTuhy6Djx6XipM3g</a><br />    👍Caffeinated Humor Podcast:<br />     <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/caffeinated-humor-sarcastic-comedy-for-the-masses/id1485476178">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/caffeinated-humor-sarcastic-comedy-for-the-masses/id1485476178</a><br /><br />  Email: World2Briggs@Gmail.com<br />  Mailing Address:   World According to Briggs<br />                                 20449 SW Tualatin Valley Hwy<br />                                 # 354<br />                                 Aloha, Oregon 97003{% endraw %}
