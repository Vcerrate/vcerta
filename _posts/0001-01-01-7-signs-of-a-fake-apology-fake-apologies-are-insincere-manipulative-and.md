{% raw %}Fake apologies are insincere, manipulative, and oftentimes very confrontative. Some people get defensive when you tell them that theyâ€™ve done something wrong and may react by denying it, playing the victim, making excuses, or shifting the blame on someone else. When someone hurts you and gives you a fake apology, it can feel just as worse as never even apologizing at all.
