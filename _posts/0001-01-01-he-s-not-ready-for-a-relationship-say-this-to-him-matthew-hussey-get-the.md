Maybe he’s travelling the world this year and won’t have time for a relationship. Or maybe...potentially...it’s just his BS excuse because he wants to play the field and enjoy the sexual delights of the bachelor lifestyle.<br /><br />All that matters is this...what does it mean for you?<br /><br />I’ve seen so many women handle this conversation in TERRIBLE ways. They get upset, angry, emotional – giving up months and months trying to win him over and convince him to be in a relationship.<br /><br />I know this sucks, but I’m going to show you EXACTLY what to say in your response to a guy in this moment so that you feel empowered, confident, and in control of your romantic destiny again<br /><br />Remember, it’s not what other people do that defines the quality of our love life, but how we respond to what other people do. <br /><br />▼ Links At The End ▼ <br /><br />Get Your Copy of the 59 Secret Scripts to Use With Men: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://GetTheScripts.com">http://GetTheScripts.com</a><br /><br />▼ Get My Latest Dating Tips and Connect With Me ▼<br /><br />Blog → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.howtogettheguy.com/blog/">https://www.howtogettheguy.com/blog/</a><br /><br />Facebook → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/CoachMatthewHussey">https://facebook.com/CoachMatthewHussey</a><br /><br />Instagram → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thematthewhussey">https://www.instagram.com/thematthewhussey</a><br /><br />Twitter → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/matthewhussey">https://twitter.com/matthewhussey</a>{% endraw %}
