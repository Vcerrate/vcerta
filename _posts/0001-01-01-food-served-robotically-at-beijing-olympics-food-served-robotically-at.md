{% raw %}#Food #Served #Robotically #at #Beijing #Olympics  <br />INTERNATIONAL: Amid the Covid-19 pandemic and less than a month before the start of the Winter Olympics, Beijing has found a way to use less staff in the kitchens and restaurants, and cope with social distancing measures required to prevent the spread of Covid-19.<br /><br />The futuristic solution found is to serve food through robotic platforms that deliver plates from the ceiling through a wire.<br /><br />Other machines can also be seen in the kitchens, with a robot producing a hamburger for journalists who have arrived at the Olympic venue.<br /><br />Journalists arriving early for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing have been among the first to have their food served to them remotely by robots.<br /><br />While noodles are a fairly conventional dish in China, 'noodles from the ceiling' aren't, but that's the way lunch is dished up in the canteen in the Main Press Centre.<br /><br />The delivery system was a real novelty for the journalists who arrived on Tuesday, with their burgers even being prepared robotically.<br /><br />The upcoming Winter Olympics will have stricter Covid-19 protocols for visiting media, athletes and officials than that seen at the Tokyo Summer Olympics in 2021. All those who enter the Olympic village will be confined to a bubble which they cannot leave, and no interaction will be allowed between those inside and outside of it.<br /><br />Only those who undergo a three-week quarantine upon arrival can work outside the bubble, although once they leave, they will not be able to come back in.<br /><br />However, unlike Tokyo, domestic spectators will be allowed to attend the sporting events. The Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics are set to begin on 4 February.<br />The official EAC YouTube Channel.
