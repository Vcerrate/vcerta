{% raw %}The silverwing started as a Gl500 motorcycle and eventually became a giant scooter. Competing head on with the burgman 650 this silverwing is slightly smaller and has less bells and whistles. But it's a bike with a enthusiastic audience. Just like many Hondas with followings, this Silverwing scooter has become a very sought after machine because of its comfort, reliability and ultra smoothness.{% endraw %}
