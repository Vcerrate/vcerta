{% raw %}If there are any other topics you want us to cover please let us know.<br /><br />As a general rule neither Prof or Dr Mew have time to engage in the comments section, their focus must be to gain as much real change and scientific engagement as possible, and this would otherwise consume all their time.  If you want to engage with Prof John Mew or Dr Mike Mew on this or other topics then follow these links (if you want a personal opinion on your situation then please book an on-line consultation at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://orthodontichealth.co.uk/book-a-consultation/);">https://orthodontichealth.co.uk/book-a-consultation/);</a><br /><br />Professionals (of any medical/health discipline);<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/Orthodont/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/Orthodont/</a> or <br /><br />Non Professionals;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/craniofacialactiongroup">https://www.facebook.com/groups/craniofacialactiongroup</a> or <br /><br />For more general information please visit; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://orthotropics.com/">https://orthotropics.com/</a> <br /><br />Please consider joining our Patreon Community: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/orthotropics">https://www.patreon.com/orthotropics</a><br />Particularly if you have;<br />1) gained any benefit from the information that we have provided (usually for free).<br />2) wish to have the benefits of being a patreon member.<br />3) believe in, and wish to support our mission to gain full, free and fair debate (engagement) on these issues within the orthodontic and dental community. <br /><br />Currently the full proceeds of the patreon is directed to the video team, who donate the rest of their time for free.  Please help in spreading this message. <br /><br />best wishes,<br />Orthotropics Video Team.<br /><br />This channel is part of the International Association of Facial Growth Guidance.  A nonprofit organisation which aims to raise awareness of alternative orthodontic methods and ideas, which too few people are informed of. <br /><br />The main aim of the platform is to precipitate debate on why teeth are crooked.  Most people are not aware that (in most cases) the dental profession has little or no idea why the teeth are crooked, or for that matter why children need major surgery.  Clearly there are genetic issues, however the science is clear, the weight of quality research papers, in respected peer reviewed journals, show that our modern lifestyle is a more important factor and most importantly we can do something about this.<br /><br />This is especially important as sleep apnoea, TMD, forward head posture and a most otolaryngology problems are implicated as other symptoms of the same underlying problem.<br /><br />Disclaimer; We regularly post discussions and debates from guests and colleges.

In the pursuit of the truth it is normal in science to make speculative comments which may not have full scientific support, and we welcome feedback and discussion. <br /><br />In general, the videos posted on this web site are not advertisements, and will clearly be labelled as such if necessary.
