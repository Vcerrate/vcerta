{% raw %}Rhythms of Bahrain<br />Bahrain Heritage Festival has gained worldwide reputation since its launch in 1992. Under the patronage of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, The King of The Kingdom of Bahrain, Bahraini traditions are presented annually within the festival, which reflects the keenness of His Majesty to patronize this event in order to preserve this rich heritage for the future generations. <br />The festival will be held on the 14th of April till the 21st of April from 4-9 p.m. at the tent located at the Bahrain National Museum.<br />This year the Heritage Festival in its 24th edition will focus on intangible heritage revolving around the concept of memories of the sea and the island during the period of diving and pearling. This will also portray the role of women during the absence of the pearl divers for the four-month duration. Women had to take over the lighter professions of their husbands to sustain their livelihood.<br />Titled under “Rhythms of Bahrain”, the festival will showcase four passages of the memory journey throughout artistic installations, mainly focusing on sound. The festival will highlight the following:<br />1. Preparation for the diving seasons <br />2. The farewell festival- the official day of boarding (al-rakbah) <br />3. The women’s daily life on the island- The wait <br />4. Welcoming the divers back- the day of the return of the crew (al-quffāl)<br />The festival also offers a chance to see some of Bahrain's finest craftsmen at work- basket weaving, pottery, handicrafts etc. Visitors, locally and internationally, are dazzled every year with exhibits relating to Bahrain's tradition and culture and the distinctiveness of Bahrain’s music and folk-dance. There will be a balanced mixture of traditional and contemporary products at the souq surrounded by Bahraini cafes offering the visitor to experience flavors of the kingdom. This year, the introduction to an educational program for the children’s section will enable the visitor to experience and learn about Bahrain’s heritage and culture.{% endraw %}
