{% raw %}Three quick case studies describe how concrete temperature and maturity monitoring has improved three projects.<br /><br />To save time and money, improve quality and safety, and meet project requirements, construction teams track concrete temperature and maturity with concrete temperature and maturity meters. Monitoring concrete maturity helps construction teams know when their in-place concrete has reached adequate strength so they can safely move on the next phase of construction as soon as possible.<br /><br />COMMAND Center concrete temperature and maturity monitoring has lowered budgets and accelerated construction schedules on hundreds of projects.<br /><br />The COMMAND Center system includes state-of-the-art temperature sensors, a handheld device that allows you to read and analyze sensor data onsite, and comprehensive software. Each small, self-powered sensor arrives ready to track temperature, maturity, and strength right out of the box. Place concrete over the sensors, then use the COMMAND Center handheld device to view the sensorsâ€™ full temperature history and estimate strength at the job site.<br /><br />www.COMMANDCenterConcrete.com{% endraw %}
