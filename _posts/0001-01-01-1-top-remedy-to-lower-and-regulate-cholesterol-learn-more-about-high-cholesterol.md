If you‚Äôre on keto and your cholesterol has gone up, making you concerned‚Äîthis video is for you. <br /><br />Your body makes cholesterol, and it also needs cholesterol. When you burn fat, part of that fat is cholesterol. When you lose weight, the cholesterol has to come out, temporarily increasing your cholesterol. <br /><br />If you‚Äôre on a low-carb diet, you don‚Äôt really need to be concerned about your cholesterol. But, if you are concerned, you can get an advanced lipid profile test. Cholesterol also isn‚Äôt a good indicator of heart problems. A much better test is a CAC test. <br /><br />Bile is an important fluid in the body that is essential in regulating cholesterol. Bile is made from cholesterol, and it helps you break down fats, extract fat-soluble vitamins, and prevent SIBO. <br /><br />You also have secondary bile salts made by the friendly bacteria in your large intestine. A problem with your microbiome (friendly bacteria) can cause a lack of bile, which can lead to higher cholesterol. <br /><br />There are some interesting studies that show that probiotics can help lower cholesterol. Studies also show that fiber helps reduce cholesterol. Fiber feeds your microbes that then make bile salts. The best source of healthy fiber is fermented vegetables. <br /><br />One of the best remedies to lower cholesterol is niacin (vitamin B3). Niacin can help lower your cholesterol directly and indirectly by supporting bile production. <br /><br />If a person has their gallbladder removed, they might not have enough primary bile salts to remove the cholesterol, and certain lipids can start increasing. <br /><br />Overall, the best natural remedies to lower cholesterol are:<br />1. Probiotics (from food if possible) <br />2. TUDCA <br />3. Niacin <br /><br /><br />Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:<br />Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.
