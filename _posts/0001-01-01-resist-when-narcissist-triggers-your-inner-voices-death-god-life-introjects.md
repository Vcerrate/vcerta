{% raw %}The narcissist implants his introjects (voices) in your mind, using abusive entraining. His voices, in turn, trigger your voices,. Here is a map of the narcissist's voices in your mind (D=Death, L=Life, G=God). First letter is his voice in your mind - second letter is your voice triggered by his voice in your mind:<br /><br />D  L (his narcissistic abuse-your survival instincts)<br />G  G (his and your narcissistic defenses)<br />L  D (his narcissistic abuse in order to separate-individuate, your self-sacrifice)<br /><br />Death voice: You are not lovable, unworthy, inadequate, failure, better off dead.<br /><br />Can be loved and deserving of life only if perfect (impossible)<br /><br />Terrified of failure (performance anxiety), the narcissist rejects, disowns, sabotages, and avoids all aspects of life, rendering himself invulnerable by being dead within and without as a form of rigid, proud, defiant, sadistically self-punitive and self-denying ideology. S/he acts entitled and contemptuous (e.g., celibate).<br /><br />He gives up on and denies his body, health, sex, romance, intimacy, all positive emotions, relationships, family, academic degrees, career, country, language, success, reputation, business, social life, fans, and friends. <br /><br />With nothing left to take, death voice is appeased and ameliorated by my proximity to actual death, its mission accomplished and it is placated, content to let me decay and decompose inertly.<br /><br />God voice: Grandiose, magical thinking, my mental illness (cruel false self) eroded by reality (injuries, mortifications).<br /><br />Life voice: Creativity and cooperation are intermittent, haphazard, corroded by aging and is often too late, failing the narcissist amid cognitive decline.<br /><br />Find and Buy MOST of my BOOKS and eBOOKS in my Amazon Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/60F8EC8A-5812-4007-9F2C-DFA02EA713B3">https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/60F8EC8A-5812-4007-9F2C-DFA02EA713B3</a>{% endraw %}
