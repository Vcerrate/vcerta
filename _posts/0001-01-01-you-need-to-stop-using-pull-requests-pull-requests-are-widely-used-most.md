{% raw %}Pull requests are widely used. Most teams create a pull request somewhere on their route to releasing change. They see them as the only way to conduct code reviews, but they are not. Pull requests were invented to manage large, open-source projects, but working within an organisation with a team is not the same thing as open-source programming. In general, our advice is don‚Äôt do pull requests, but why is that, and what should you do instead?<br /><br />In this episode, Dave Farley, author of Continuous Delivery and Modern Software Engineering explores the idea of pull requests and the issues that they raise. Dave offers several alternatives and discusses the pros and cons of each, ending up with some concrete advice on what you should do instead.<br /><br />_____________________________________________________<br /><br />üîó LINKS:<br /><br />DORA - State of DevOps ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.devops-research.com/research.html">https://www.devops-research.com/research.html</a><br /><br />DevOps Handbook ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LsoPmr">https://amzn.to/2LsoPmr</a><br /><br />‚ÄúPair Programming ‚Äì The Most Extreme XP Practice?&quot; ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.davefarley.net/?p=214">https://www.davefarley.net/?p=214</a><br /><br />‚ÄúPair Programming for Introverts‚Äù ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.davefarley.net/?p=267">https://www.davefarley.net/?p=267</a><br /><br />‚ÄúPair programming improves flow‚Äù ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0735633120949788">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0735633120949788</a><br /><br />‚ÄòThe Case for Collaborative Programming‚Äô Nosek‚Äô ‚û°Ô∏è bit.ly/1J6LrAP<br /><br />Strengthening The Case for Pair Programming‚Äô Williams, Kessler, Cunningham &amp; Jeffries ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/ieeeSoftware.PDF">https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/ieeeSoftware.PDF</a><br /><br />‚ÄòPair Programming is about Business Continuity‚Äò Dave Hounslow ‚û°Ô∏è bit.ly/1Pk0JFW<br /><br />_____________________________________________________<br /><br />üìö BOOKS:<br /><br />üö® üìñ Dave‚Äôs NEW BOOK &quot;Modern Software Engineering&quot; is now available here ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3DwdwT3">https://amzn.to/3DwdwT3</a><br /><br />In this book, Dave brings together his ideas and proven techniques to describe a durable, coherent and foundational approach to effective software development, for programmers, managers and technical leads, at all levels of experience.<br /><br />üìñ &quot;Continuous Delivery Pipelines&quot; by Dave Farley<br />paperback ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3gIULlA">https://amzn.to/3gIULlA</a><br />ebook version ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines">https://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines</a><br /><br />üìñ The original, award-winning &quot;Continuous Delivery&quot; book by Dave Farley and Jez Humble ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WxRYmx">https://amzn.to/2WxRYmx</a><br /><br />NOTE: If you click on one of the Amazon Affiliate links and buy the book, Continuous Delivery Ltd. will get a small fee for the recommendation with NO increase in cost to you.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />LEARNING CONTENT FROM DAVE:<br /><br />üéì CD TRAINING COURSES <br />If you want to learn Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills, check out Dave Farley's courses <br />‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/DFTraining">https://bit.ly/DFTraining</a><br /><br />ANATOMY OF A DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE COURSE ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://courses.cd.training/courses/the-anatomy-of-a-deployment-pipeline">https://courses.cd.training/courses/the-anatomy-of-a-deployment-pipeline</a><br /><br />üìß JOIN CD MAIL LIST üìß<br />Keep up to date with the latest discussions, free &quot;How To...&quot; guides, events, online courses and exclusive offers. ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/MailListCD">https://bit.ly/MailListCD</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />CHANNEL SPONSORS:<br /><br />Equal Experts is a product software development consultancy with a network of over 1,000 experienced technology consultants globally.
