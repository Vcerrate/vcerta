{% raw %}A few years ago I was stung by the &quot;Diving&quot; virus. I quickly became an instructor and over time I was able to accumulate more than 6000 dives mainly in Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysia. During these dives, I noticed how fragile the ecosystems are. I came up with the idea of ​​filming everything I could for fear of not seeing it again one day. Of course I could not take my camera for each of these dives but I do it whenever I have the opportunity. <br /><br />Today we were able to identify and filmed in full HD 500 different underwater species. This documentary of 60 minutes retraces these different species with the scientific description and the Latin name of each species. <br /><br />Our goal is to show the world how precious the oceans are and full of life that unfortunately the humanity is likely to endanger ... <br /><br />We sometimes forget that the oceans provide us with more than 60% of the oxygen we we need to live. Half of the photosynthesis and removal of carbon dioxide takes place in the oceans. Marine species play a key role in this regulation. It is therefore important to identify and protect them. Unfortunately for humans, this protection is not a priority. On the contrary, the human pressures on the oceans are increasing every day, the impact is irreversible! <br /><br />Through this documentary, we hope to be able to arouse interest on the various underwater species and their protection. We also say to ourself that if our future generations also want to be able to contemplate the beauty of our planet, we have to act quickly! If we continue like this, our grandchildren will not even see a quarter of what you see in this documentary.<br /><br />I would especially like to thank my partner and dive Buddy Lily Romero who filmed and helped me editing this amazing video. As well as laurent Minsart for some macro shots in Lembeh, Indonesia. Special Big Up to all those who participated by loan or by far at this documentary, Dive Guide Local Boat Captain.<br /><br /><br />More Info or collab<br /><br />Lily Romero &amp; Pierre Bijloos<br />www.lilyromero.com<br /><br />IG: LILYRYOGA<br />IG: PANO4LIFE{% endraw %}
