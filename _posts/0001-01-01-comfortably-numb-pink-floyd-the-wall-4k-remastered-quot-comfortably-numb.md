{% raw %}&quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; is a song on Pink Floyd's eleventh album, The Wall (1979). It was released as a single in 1980 with &quot;Hey You&quot; as the B-side. The music was composed by guitarist David Gilmour, and lyrics were written by bassist Roger Waters.<br /><br />The Wall is a concept album about an embittered and alienated rock star named Pink. In &quot;Comfortably Numb,&quot; Pink is medicated by a doctor so he can perform for a show.<br /><br />Guitarist David Gilmour recorded a wordless demo, and bassist Roger Waters wrote lyrics, inspired by an experience of being injected with tranquilizers for stomach cramps before a 1977 performance in Philadelphia on the In the Flesh Tour. &quot;That was the longest two hours of my life,&quot; Waters said, &quot;trying to do a show when you can hardly lift your arm.&quot; The song's working title was &quot;The Doctor&quot;.<br /><br />For the chorus, Gilmour and session player Lee Ritenour used a pair of acoustic guitars strung similarly to Nashville tuning, but with the low E string replaced with a high E string, two octaves higher than standard tuning. This tuning was also used for the arpeggios in &quot;Hey You&quot;.<br /><br />Waters and Gilmour disagreed about how to record the song; Gilmour preferred a more grungy style for the verses. Gilmour said: &quot;We argued over 'Comfortably Numb' like mad. Really had a big fight, went on for ages.&quot; In the end, Waters' preferred opening and Gilmour's final solo were used.[citation needed]<br /><br />To write the two guitar solos, Gilmour pieced together elements from several other solos he had been working on, marking his preferred segments for the final take.<br /><br />Input: 720x480 29.97fps (source: DVD)<br />Output: 3840x2160 59.94fps<br /><br />The Wall full movie playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyGHs2yXwu1SWIXC6TLHT4a-2rdr9Un0f">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyGHs2yXwu1SWIXC6TLHT4a-2rdr9Un0f</a><br /><br />All rights reserved to Pink Floyd and Roger Waters.
