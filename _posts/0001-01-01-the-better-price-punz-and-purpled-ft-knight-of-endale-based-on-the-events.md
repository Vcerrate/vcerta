{% raw %}I started writing this song right after the Red Banquet along with Cliché but I was having trouble with the lyrics and wasn't sure who to ask. Then, someone recommended me Knight of Endale, who was already on my list of people to ask. So I asked her and she said yes!! So we worked together to write the song, melody and music and it was really fun working with her!!<br /><br />What is one of the things Purpled and Punz have in common? They'll do things for money. They're both mercenaries who gave up their loyalties for their own personal gain. Punz gave up his loyalty to Dream to help Tommy because Tommy had given him so much more than Dream ever had. Purpled betrayed the Eggpire in order to save his home and because Quackity had offered him money. But was the betrayal worth it in the end?<br /><br />Words and Music by Boxty and Knight of Endale<br /><br />Knight's Socials:<br />YT: youtube.com/c/KnightofEndale<br />Twitter: twitter.com/KnightofEndale<br />TikTok: tiktok.com/@knightofendale?lang=en<br /><br />Art by my cousin, jln:<br />instagram.com/jln7142008<br /><br />the line &quot;money may be a terrible master, but an excellent servant&quot; was written by my friend choroipoli:<br />Twitch: twitch.tv/choroipoli<br /><br />Purpled:<br />YT: youtube.com/c/PurpledMC<br />Twitch: twitch.tv/purpled<br /><br />Punz:<br />YT: youtube.com/c/Punzz<br />Twitch: twitch.tv/punz<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />Money may be a terrible master<br />But an excellent servant<br />If it’s for the right price<br />Then I’m willing to do what you want<br /><br />Sure, loyalty comes with time<br />But here's a piece of advice<br />if there’s a better offer<br />Then, you take the better price<br /><br />I am a mercenary<br />I’m loyal to those who pay me<br />Some may say I'm a yes man but<br />I don’t care that it’s part of a bigger plan<br /><br />I was always loyal to him<br />The chances of betrayal were slim<br />But the kid had the better offer<br />so I was slightly deterred<br /><br />It was more than I had ever been given<br />He really needed me, but not as a friend<br />The other one was slowly going insane<br />So I won’t play his little game<br /><br />When the final day had come<br />The kid looked like he was done for<br />But I betrayed my first loyalty<br />Because he should have paid me more<br /><br />And as they all say<br />And as they all say<br /><br />Money may be a terrible master<br />But an excellent servant<br />If it’s for the right price<br />Then I’m willing to do what you want<br /><br />Sure, loyalty comes with time<br />But here's a piece of advice<br />If there’s a better offer<br />Then, you take the better price<br /><br />I was always a mercenary<br />But desperate times call for desperate means <br />So I let the crimson cult hire me<br />But then I gave up my loyalty<br /><br />Nothing is ever written in stone<br />It’s funny cause they should have known<br />I was a traitor in the gambler’s game<br />I’m gonna bring back my own name<br /><br />I took that side cause he paid me more<br />Even if it meant we go to war<br />How could I have said no<br />When he threatened my UFO<br /><br />But it didn’t take long for my patience to break<br />Betting on a book, I played high stakes<br />But it turns out it was all in vain<br />Because I lost more than I ever gained<br /><br />And as they all say<br />And as they all say<br /><br />Money may be a terrible master<br />But an excellent servant<br />If it’s for the right price<br />Then I’m willing to do what you want<br /><br />Sure, loyalty comes with time<br />But here's a piece of advice<br />If there’s a better offer<br />Then, you take the better price<br /><br />I got the gold but I just lost my best friend<br />I don’t know if I should have sided with that child<br />Even though I got the gold, it was far from the end<br />Because some wrongs can’t be reconciled<br /><br />And as they all say<br />And as they all say<br />And as we all say<br />And as we all say<br /><br />Money may be a terrible master<br />But an excellent servant<br />Even if you get paid<br />It might not leave you content<br /><br />Sure, loyalty comes with time<br />But here's a piece of advice<br />It might not be worth <br />To take the better price<br /><br />Chords:<br />Verse: Am F Dm E<br />Chorus: Am Dm E Am<br />Bridge: Am Dm B E<br /><br />Keywords for Algorithm:<br />Dream SMP, Purpled, Punz, Dream SMP Original Song, Punz's Dream SMP Original Song, Purpled's Dream SMP Original Song, Minecraft, Dream SMP Theme, Fan Song, Dream, Technoblade, Quackity Eggpire, Red Banquet, Knight of Endale, DSMP, Disc Finale, Derivakat, Amanda Fagan, Winks, Precious Jewel Amor, Hator, Alioof, Halfy, Fenyx, Ellinort, Halfy, Tia Jade, Mizz, Kanaya, Megan Shumway, Seiggel, CG5, Endicott, Creamay, Butterscotch Bread <br /> <br />#purpled #punz #dreamsmp{% endraw %}
