{% raw %}Commercial VPNs probably hurt your privacy and security more than they help. Behind the layers of marketing sits a darker side of the industry. Ask yourself questions like:<br /><br />- Why trust a VPN company and their ISP over my own?<br />- Who‚Äôs actually running these companies?<br />- Why so many VPN ads on YouTube?<br />- What‚Äôs up with all the review sites?<br /><br />VPNs are designed to transport devices from a network of low trust to high trust. Or bridge traffic between high and high trust. A site-to-site or corporate VPN both fall in this category. <br /><br />With commercial VPNs, you‚Äôre more likely to be transporting your Internet to a network of lower or uncertain trust. Rather than just your ISP seeing your traffic, you grant this privilege to the VPN provider and their ISP too.<br /><br />Most of the providers out there are owned by just a few parent companies. Many of them have hidden ownership and conflicting motivations. Many ‚Äúno-logging‚Äù VPN companies have turned out to be doing the opposite.<br /><br />You shouldn‚Äôt use a VPN if:<br />- You want to encrypt your traffic. <br /><br />Most of your traffic is already encrypted because most common sites support HTTPS. Encrypting your DNS queries is becoming standard too in web browsers. <br /><br />- You want to hide your identity. <br /><br />There‚Äôs all kinds of other metadata in your network packets available to track you. Advanced actors can correlate them to track and discover your location.<br /><br />There are some cases where using a VPN does make sense though.<br /><br />- You want to mask your IP address.<br />- Circumventing IP blocks to watch Netflix<br />- Getting around national firewalls<br />- Bypassing download limits<br />- Performing offensive security assessments<br />- Conducting OSINT and research<br /><br />If you do need a VPN, the best option is to do-it-yourself. Tunnel back to a home server. Set up a cloud server. Open-source software like Wireguard, Shadowsocks, and SSH makes this easy.<br /><br />Not to mention the hundreds of guides out there to follow.<br /><br />üëç SUBSCRIBE AND FOLLOW<br /><br />ü§ù SHARE THIS VIDEO:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://badvpns.com">https://badvpns.com</a>  <br /><br />üìñ Additional Reading:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://overengineer.dev/blog/2019/04/08/very-precarious-narrative.html">https://overengineer.dev/blog/2019/04/08/very-precarious-narrative.html</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/03/post-fcc-privacy-rules-should-you-vpn/">https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/03/post-fcc-privacy-rules-should-you-vpn/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/854131577353367554">https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/854131577353367554</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drewdevault.com/2019/04/19/Your-VPN-is-a-serious-choice.html">https://drewdevault.com/2019/04/19/Your-VPN-is-a-serious-choice.html</a><br /><br />You might be asking at this point, <br />00:00 Should You Stop Using VPNs?<br />01:00 The Mysterious History of Snake Oil<br />02:09 The Problem With VPNs<br />03:46 How People Think VPNs Work<br />04:59 What They Don't Tell You About VPNs<br />07:42 BadVPNs<br />08:10 How the CIA used CryptoAG to Spy on the World<br />10:13 How Spy Agencies Would Use VPNs<br />11:35 When Should I Use a VPN?<br />13:41 Signs of a Trustworthy VPN Provider<br /><br />#VPN #Privacy #Security{% endraw %}
