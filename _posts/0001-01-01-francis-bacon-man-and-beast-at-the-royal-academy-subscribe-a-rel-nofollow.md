{% raw %}Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/ofIySI">http://goo.gl/ofIySI</a>  The Art Channel visits a large exhibition of paintings by Francis Bacon which show how mankind resembles animals, little different to dogs or apes. Surviving the Second World War and drawing on his experience as an outsider, a gay man living through a time of criminalised homosexuality, Bacon alludes in the paintings to personal experience, clips from films and media images. Remaining a figurative painter at a time when abstraction was in fashion, Bacon's primarily isolated male figures are depicted at times of crisis or in a struggle for survival. Bullfighters face charging bulls. A Pope howls in anguish. Men wrestle on the ground for dominance. Watch the film to learn why Bacon's paintings illustrate his attitude to the human journey through life.{% endraw %}
