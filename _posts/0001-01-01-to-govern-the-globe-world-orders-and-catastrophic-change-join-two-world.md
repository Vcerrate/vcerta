{% raw %}Join two world-renowned historians, Andrew Bacevich and Alfred W. McCoy, to discuss McCoy's latest book, To Govern the Globe: World Orders and Catastrophic Change.<br />———————————————————————————————————<br /><br />In a sweep through seven centuries from 1350 to 2050, the work explains how catastrophes-- pandemics, wars, and climate crisis--have shaped the destiny of empires and world orders. By rendering often-opaque environmental science in lucid prose, the book explains how climate change and changing world orders will shape the life opportunities for younger generations, born at the start of this century, during the coming decades that will serve as the signposts of their lives—2030, 2050, 2070, and beyond.<br /><br />Get To Govern the Globe: World Orders and Catastrophic Change from Haymarket: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1742-to-govern-the-globe">https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1742-to-govern-the-globe</a><br />———————————————————————————————————<br /><br />Speakers:<br /><br />Alfred W.
