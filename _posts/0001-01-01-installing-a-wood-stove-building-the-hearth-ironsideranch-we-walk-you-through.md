{% raw %}#ironsideranch We walk you through the steps we took in building our brick hearth and installing the wood stove. <br />Iron Side Ranch LLC is documenting our journey from one dog to eventually making a living off our little homestead raising cows, chickens, pigs, goats, sheep, bees, and anything else we can grow.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Eventually we hope to have all of them running and producing income and enjoyment. We would also like to get started taking home grown goods to a farmers market. Join us while we discover our roots and journey through the country life. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />reach out to us at:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />www.facebook.com/ironsideranchllc<br /> ironsideranchllc@gmail.com <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />see our sponsors www.timberlineinspections.com reach out to us at:<br />www.facebook.com/ironsideranchllc<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ironsideranchllc/">https://www.instagram.com/ironsideranchllc/</a><br /> ironsideranchllc@gmail.com <br /><br />Need a home or commercial property inspection in Birmignahm AL?  www.timberlineinspections.com<br /><br />Products We Like and use regualrly on the farm: These are affiliate links and we may earn a commission on them. <br /><br />Water Filter We Love: <br /><br />Paint Markers - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3BVesPX">https://amzn.to/3BVesPX</a><br />Radiator Genie - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3kne0E6">https://amzn.to/3kne0E6</a><br />Decent Calipers - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3qocp4O">https://amzn.to/3qocp4O</a><br />Ratcheting Wrench - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ofNFZz">https://amzn.to/3ofNFZz</a><br />Electric Netting - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3wvkLZp">https://amzn.to/3wvkLZp</a><br /><br />Silver skyrocketing, joel salatin, greg judy.
