{% raw %}The Senate voted Thursday to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court by a vote of 53-47. Three Republican senators — Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah — joined all 50 Democrats in voting in favor of Jackson’s confirmation.<br />Jackson was nominated by President Joe Biden in February to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. Jackson will be the first Black woman, as well as the first public defender, on the high court. She will join the court when Breyer officially steps down at the end of the current term in June.<br /><br />Stream your PBS favorites with the PBS app: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://to.pbs.org/2Jb8twG">https://to.pbs.org/2Jb8twG</a><br />Find more from PBS NewsHour at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour">https://www.pbs.org/newshour</a><br />Subscribe to our YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2HfsCD6">https://bit.ly/2HfsCD6</a><br /><br />Follow us:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour">http://www.pbs.org/newshour</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/newshour">http://www.twitter.com/newshour</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/newshour">http://www.instagram.com/newshour</a><br /><br />Subscribe:<br />PBS NewsHour podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts</a><br />Newsletters: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/subscribe">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/subscribe</a>{% endraw %}
