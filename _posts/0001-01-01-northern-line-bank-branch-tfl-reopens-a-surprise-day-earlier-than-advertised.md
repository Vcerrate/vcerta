{% raw %}BOOM! Northern line reopened: A DAY EARLY. @transportforlondon pulled back the gates, trains started running, staff at the the gateline smiled and THEY WAITED. No announcement, no fanfare, just the JOY of passengers happening upon a railway that ain’t meant to be there yet and grinning staff delighted that a few of us have walked past, done a double-take and said “is… is it open?” Whoever is Louisa’s boss at Borough GIVE HER A BIG GOLD STAR please because she is the sort of person that makes @transportforlondon GREAT. She is so chuffed to have people back and she has been proudly showing customers her lovely gleaming white new station all afternoon. The rest of you - everyone involved in the Bank Upgrade project - I know it’s been a crazy 17 weeks because I saw behind the scenes: you are all total superstars. And it ain’t finished yet: travolator and escalators and snagging is still in hand. But it’s open and you sodding did it and we who use the branch as part of our daily lives will be so sodding pleased. ‘Twas lovely to bump into so many fellow tubs lovers down there last night - especially my old chum Geoff. <br />.<br />To see BEHIND THE SCENES of this project - and what’s been left behind - #secretsofthelondonunderground this Thursday night at 8pm on Yesterday channel shows the birth of the new tube route. More footage from behind the cameras in Jan on my Instagram and twitter from me later this week!
