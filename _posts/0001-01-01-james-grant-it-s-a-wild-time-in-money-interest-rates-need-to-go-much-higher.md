In this video, he shares his predictions on what will come next during this &quot;wild time in money&quot; and offers several assets today's investor would do well to consider.<br /><br />At Wealthion, we show you how to protect and build your wealth by learning from the world’s top experts on finance and money.

Above and beyond the recent economic impacts of COVID, the new era of record low interest rates, runaway US debt and US deficits, and trillions of dollars in monetary and fiscal stimulus stimulus has changed the rules of investing by dangerously distorting the Dow index, the S&amp;P 500, and nearly all other asset prices.
