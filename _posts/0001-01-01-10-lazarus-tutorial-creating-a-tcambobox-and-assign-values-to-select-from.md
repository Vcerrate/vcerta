{% raw %}To use a TComboBox on a form, you can simply select it on the Standard tab of the Component Palette and place it by clicking on the form.<br /><br />In the ComboBox, the stored strings are stored in the property Items, that is of type TStrings. Thus you can assign or remove strings in the ComboBox, as in a TStringList or its parent TStrings.{% endraw %}
