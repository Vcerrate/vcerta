Upfront, my conclusion is that you should go for the Paperwhite, but the standard kindle is also pretty good and much cheaper, it just comes with a few compromises. The Signature and Oasis are both pretty ridiculous unless you have money to burn or a very niche use-case. Hopefully this video helps with your decision!
