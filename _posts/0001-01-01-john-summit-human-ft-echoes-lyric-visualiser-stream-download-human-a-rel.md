The label has brought countless culturally important records across the dance music spectrum over the years including Orbital, Armand Van Helden, Salt ‘N’ Pepa, Lil Louis, Goldie to name but a few. <br />We continue to build on that heritage with new &amp; exciting cutting-edge music. Since the beginning of 2020, FFRR has enjoyed success with Diplo &amp; SIDEPIECE’s “On My Mind”, Alan Fitzpatrick vs Patrice Rushen’s “Haven’t You Heard” and Obskür’s “Bayside”. They have also welcomed artists such as Eats Everything, Sam Gellaitry and Sonny Fodera to the FFRR family.<br />Our mission is to release Music That Moves You.<br /><br />#FFRR #JohnSummit #Human{% endraw %}
