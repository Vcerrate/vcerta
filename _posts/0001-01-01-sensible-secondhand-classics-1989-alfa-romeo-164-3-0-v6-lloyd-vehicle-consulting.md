This time we test a 1989 Alfa Romeo 164 3.0 V6, which may be one of the most attractive cars we have ever had on the channel. Join us as we experience torque steer, get the button wrong for the glovebox, find out what incorrectly set up coilovers feel like, talk about gravel rash, get enthused about brochures and generally experience little of any consequence at all. Nothing untoward then!<br /><br />Tweed Jacket Reviews: 2000 Alfa Romeo 145 2.0 Twin Spark - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6hgwU_ANTH4">https://youtu.be/6hgwU_ANTH4</a><br />Sensible Secondhand Classics: 2004 Alfa Romeo 166 2.0 Twin Spark Lusso - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/pacsmhsxF0s">https://youtu.be/pacsmhsxF0s</a><br />Sensible Secondhand Classics: 2003 Alfa Romeo Spider (916) 2.0 JTS - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/_uAAZtw5LdM">https://youtu.be/_uAAZtw5LdM</a><br />Tweed Jacket Reviews: 1985 Alfa Romeo 90 2.5 Gold Cloverleaf - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/HhjQM3RhbZw">https://youtu.be/HhjQM3RhbZw</a><br />Tweed Jacket Reviews: 2002 Alfa Romeo 166 3.0 V6 24V Lusso Sportronic - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/YmtpcY6NZ_4">https://youtu.be/YmtpcY6NZ_4</a><br /><br />Theme Music &quot;A Song For Humans&quot; by Laurence Callaghan and The Tin Cans <br />Copyright 2013 Bezalel Records <br />Download the EP at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://completing.bandcamp.com">https://completing.bandcamp.com</a><br /><br />As an independent vehicle consultant, I take potential buyers through the whole car buying process from choosing a make and model to a vehicle handover and road tax. In addition to information on this service, I also have a selection of written and video reviews of cars that I have owned, hired, borrowed or have somehow come into my possession.
