{% raw %}Have you ever wished you could believe in yourself more?  A belief is just a thought you keep thinking, and self belief can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Limiting beliefs are learned, not inherent, so rather than focusing on what you lack, believe in what you can practice and build upon.  Your past doesn't have to infiltrate your present.  Move in the direction you choose, and if you can't believe in yourself, borrow our belief in you.{% endraw %}
