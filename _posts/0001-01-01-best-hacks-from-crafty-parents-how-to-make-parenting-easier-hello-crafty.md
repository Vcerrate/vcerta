{% raw %}Hello, crafty parents! We prepared lots of useful hacks and DIY ideas for your and your kids! If your child loves drawing, you may also find some drawings on their clothes. Use a regular plastic or paper bag and prevent their clothes from getting damaged. If your kid mostly loves drawing with markers, we will show you how to store them and keep the table clean. In this video, we will share helpful studying hacks with you. You will see an easy game that will help your kid learn numbers. We will also show you a simple way to teach your kids to read and improve their vocabulary. If your child loves chemistry and trying fun experiments, do this. Mix baking soda, dye, and vinegar to see a fantastic chemical reaction! If your kid is not a fan of cleaning their teeth and does it for less than a minute, then we have a hack for you! Create a mini version of an hourglass, and put lots of glitter inside. Use your child’s favorite color to make the hourglass look cute and fun to use! If your kid loves drawing with crayons outside, put them in water for a minute to make them look brighter.<br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
