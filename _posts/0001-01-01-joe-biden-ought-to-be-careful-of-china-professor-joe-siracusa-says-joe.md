{% raw %}Professor Joe Siracusa says Joe Biden “ought to be very careful” when commenting on international affairs, after the president raised eyebrows by declaring America would defend Taiwan if China invaded.<br /><br />China’s air force entered Taiwan’s air defence zone early this week and officials have labeled the military activities “grey zone warfare” claiming the repeated incursions are designed to test the island’s response. <br /><br />President Biden and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have pledged to work together on security matters in the Pacific, as Beijing continues to try and assert its influence in the region.<br /><br />Beijing has shelved its proposals for security deals with ten pacific islands amid concerns about “specific issues” from local leaders. This comes after China claims now it is willing to cooperate with Australia in the Pacific.{% endraw %}
