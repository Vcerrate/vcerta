Post in comments section of this video!<br /><br />About This Video:<br /><br />In this episode of Apparel Success, Rob talks about why most clothing brand startups fail. Most clothing brands fail because they are unable to create a &quot;perfect storm&quot; for their business. There are so many things to learn as a clothing brand owner: social media marketing, instagram marketing, facebook ads, inventory management, design, photography, tiktok, email marketing, etc. Usually the business owner is really great at one or two of these things - but not all of them. This leads the brand to being created with a lack of balance lacking in important areas. This video applies to your clothing brand, clothing line, fashion brand, streetwear brand, t shirt business, print on demand (POD), dropshipping and beyond!{% endraw %}
