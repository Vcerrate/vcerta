According to the ancient Egyptian priests of Sais via Plato, massive cataclysms ended a powerful civilization 11,500 years ago, which incidentally is the same date anthropologists recognize as the end of the Pleistocene and start of our current Holocene age. <br /><br />White Giants of the New World <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwWjCxKzWYA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwWjCxKzWYA</a><br /><br />The Red Empire of the Ancient World<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZqjhxIApj4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZqjhxIApj4</a><br /><br />Global sea levels were 400 feet lower during the late Pleistocene, or Ice Age, when Atlantis was said to have existed in the Atlantic Ocean.
