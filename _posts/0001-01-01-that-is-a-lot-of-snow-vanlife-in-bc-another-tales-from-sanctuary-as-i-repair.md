I lost my job due to &quot;cut backs&quot; from the pandemic of 2020 and decided to seriously restructure my life. I am also a single dad who needed to find a solution that would allow me to remain in my daughter's life and plan for her future.  After tons of research into #vanlife, I knew it was for me. <br /><br />From March 2021 until October 2021 I spent my days building out my Chevrolet Express 2500, which came to be known as &quot;Lucky&quot; and as of October 18, 2021 I have been living in Lucky full time.<br /><br />The build was done with almost no experience on my end and I used the one incredible tool I had at my disposal - the internet - to learn what I needed to build Lucky into a very comfortable tiny home.<br /><br />I have always had a bit of a passion for being in front of the camera and really enjoy capturing the world around us.  This really played into how I was feeling after almost a year of working from home when I &quot;commuted&quot; from the bedroom to the couch.  I was starting to feel extremely unhealthy, unmotivated and despondent. I HATED that, and that's not a word I like to throw around.  This new lifestyle gives me opportunities I just didn't have before and I am so excited to be able to share it all with you.<br /><br />I truly believe we all have the capabilities to turn our lives around, should we choose to do so - and if I can inspire you to shoot for something better then I have done a decent job and that will keep me going.<br /><br />There is more to life than the consume, consume, spend, spend lifestyle I feel we have all been conditioned to follow and I just want to do the best I can for myself first and foremost.  Our time is limited and I do not want to waste another second on a lifestyle that doesn't bring me joy!<br /><br />Be Happy, Be Creative, Be Yourself and BE POSITIVE!{% endraw %}
