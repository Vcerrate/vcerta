{% raw %}10 Most controversial barbie's ever!<br />Subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/cv6b96">https://goo.gl/cv6b96</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Description:<br /><br />We all loved to play with Barbie dolls when we were kids, and we loved the diversity offered by Mattel. However, as grown-ups, we quickly realized that some of these toys were not the best role models for children. While some could have a bad influence and others were offensive, we were shocked to see a toy that was clearly dangerous. This is why we are showing you the 10 Most Inappropriate Barbie Dolls That Actually Exist. <br /><br />The Oreo Barbie was created after a partnership with Mattel and Oreo. Everyone loves those cookies, but the company didn’t know that it had a whole different meaning that was really offensive. That’s because “Oreo” is also a slang for black people who act white and forget their culture. And you shouldn’t take it as a compliment when someone tells you that you are black on the outside and white on the inside.<br /><br />Tattoos are becoming more and more common nowadays. But parents didn’t think that they would find it on the dolls that their kids are playing with. These were only temporary tattoos but some grown-ups think that these toys encouraged children to get tattoos even though they were way too young. And those who weren’t shocked yet just couldn’t believe that a really inappropriate tattoo was part of the toy.<br /><br />Stay tuned to hear more about the most inappropriate Barbie dolls that actually exist including the Teen Talk Barbie, the Barbie Video Girl, the Barbie Happy Family, the Barbie in a wheelchair, the Mexican Barbie, and more. Which doll do you think was the most inappropriate? Don’t be shy to answer in the comments section down below. We love to hear what you think. <br /><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/">https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/</a><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thethings.com/">http://www.thethings.com/</a>{% endraw %}
