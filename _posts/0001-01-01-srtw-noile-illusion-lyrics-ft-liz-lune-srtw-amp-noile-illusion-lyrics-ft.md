LIZ LUNE)&quot;<br /><br />Strangers in the dark<br />Led to lovers breaking hearts<br />And getting over you<br /><br />When we fell apart<br />I could still recall the start<br />When we thought we were bulletproof<br /><br />How could we be so close and then forget<br />What we wanted the most was all that we had<br />Though the good could never outweigh the bad<br />I'd rather keep the illusion in my head <br /><br />In my head<br /><br />I'd rather keep the illusion in my head<br /><br />Nights of getaways<br />Led to fighting through the day<br />Didn't make it very far<br />Still trying to understand<br />Why you left, it's such a mess<br />Never thought that's who we are<br /><br />How could we be so close and then forget<br />What we wanted the most was all that we had<br />Though the good could never outweigh the bad<br />I'd rather keep the illusion in my head <br /><br />In my head<br /><br />I'd rather keep the illusion in my head{% endraw %}
