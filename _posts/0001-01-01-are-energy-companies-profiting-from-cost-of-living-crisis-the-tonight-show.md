{% raw %}Claire Brock is joined by Charlie Weston, Lynn Boylan TD, Senator Malcolm Byrne and Professor of Economics Stephen Kinsella to react to footage of Richard Boyd Barrett in the Dáil accusing the energy companies of military profiteering. <br /><br />Claire points out the absurd nature of Bord Gáid increasing its standard charges as well as unit price.<br /><br />Senator Malcolm Byrne believes the regulator should step up. He tells Claire &quot;there is some evidence&quot; of price gouging happening in Ireland. He states that this conversation points to a wider conversation to be had about how Ireland uses energy, especially renewable energy. <br /><br />Lynn Boylan TD states that Ireland has the highest renewable energy tariffs in Europe. She believes the regulator should be advised by Minister Ryan to regulate the market. She believes there is much more the regulator should be doing.<br /><br />Professor Stephen Kinsella states that profiteering is &quot;certainly happening.&quot; He states that you will see proof of profiteering in the cordial accounts of major energy companies in the next few months. <br /><br />He believes energy companies should be taxed the amount they are increasing, in a &quot;wartime fashion.&quot; Otherwise, he recommends enforcing caps for eighteen months or so. He states we have done similar things 80 years beforehand, and that as we are in the same situation we should apply the same measures.<br /><br />#TonightVMTV #Profiteering #CostofLiving #UkraineCrisis #RichardBoydBarrett #Dáil #CharlieWeston #ClaireBrock #MalcolmByrne #LynnBoylan #CostofLivingCrisis{% endraw %}
