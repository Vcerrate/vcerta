Robert's activites in the decade before she met Andrew; how her father's  'introduction was the entry into that world; sympathy for her troubled past; how she went to Australia and was living a peaceful life until she was induced to jump on the bandwagon by a journalist offering her vast sums of money; the unforseen consequences and how they have exposed her to possible loss of lifelong freeedom; the sweetheart deal that protects her as long as she plays ball with certain powers-that-be; why the prince has been the only person sued; incendiary gameplan behind the lawsuit; imparting information gained from disapproving high-level sources within the Democratic party in the US as to what is really going on and what the real aims are; how the protection of President Clinton and the furtherance of Hillary Clinton's ambitions for the White House have come into play; why  Kaplan and Preska were appointed; their reputations anything but pristine; how the UN and Amnesty International have condemned their roles in lawsuits involving Chevron and Steven Donzinger; when the law is used to prevent justice; what Americans can do to ensure that their judiciary performs as it ought to function; and what Andrew's gameplan should be in the light of the possibility of entrapment if he pursues the civil suit to its natural conclusion. <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/LadyColinCampb/â€‹">https://www.facebook.com/LadyColinCampb/â€‹</a><br /><br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ladycolinca...â€‹">https://www.instagram.com/ladycolinca...â€‹</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/LadyColinCampb?re...â€‹">https://twitter.com/LadyColinCampb?re...â€‹</a><br /><br />Managed by Misha Ziadie-Campbell <br /><br />Â©Copyright reserved Lady Colin Campbell{% endraw %}
