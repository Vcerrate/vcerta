{% raw %}We all have different interests, but to pursue them, we have to first maintain everything. This is the problem I was running into with trying to do my house renovations. I still had to do the normal cleaning and maintenance, too! Rafael likes to build, Abigail likes to dance, sing, and twirl, Hadar likes to work on the cars, and I like to work on the house. Today we all got to do a little something of what were interested in.<br />YESTERDAY'S VIDEO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/_gUoeIAve6A">https://youtu.be/_gUoeIAve6A</a><br />Hadar, Andrea, Rafael, Abigail, Kitty &amp; Rudy.

We met for the first time in Israel, and got married in America. Andrea moved to Israel and had been living there for 10 years. We are happy to announce that.. Our family just recently moved to AMERICA! We made it! We are a fun loving and happy family. We are not fake family vloggers. You will never see us being fake. Views are not as important to us as our integrity. Many of our family and real life friends watch our videos. You can be assured that what you are seeing is 100% truth and reality. You will not only see the best of us, but the worst of us as well. We all have a story to tell and it's not always pretty. For us, it will always be real. I do not make videos just for you. These are my family's memories. There would be no point in making videos if it weren't the truth. <br /><br />Please remember, when leaving a comment, that we are not characters on a tv show. We are real people.<br /><br />About our son: Rafael was diagnosed with #OCD and High Functioning #Autism, also known as #Asperger's syndrome, on the Autism spectrum (ASD). We have a few videos of Rafael so you can understand his diagnosis better:<br /><br />DAY IN THE LIFE of a 3 year old with Autism (Aspergers Syndrome): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/-Oyj89ynMNA">https://youtu.be/-Oyj89ynMNA</a><br /><br />OCD in a 3 year old: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/GPcIrNnsruc">https://youtu.be/GPcIrNnsruc</a><br /><br />PLEASE SUBSCRIBE!<br />NEW VIDEOS EVERY SINGLE DAY!<br />If you've read this far, the secret phrase is: &quot;FoolyFun we have when we are FoolyLiving.&quot; LEAVE US A COMMENT TO LET US KNOW YOU WERE HERE! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FoolyLiving/community">https://www.youtube.com/user/FoolyLiving/community</a> <br /><br />Royalty-Free Music by Kevin MacLeod: incompetech.com<br />Royalty-Free Music by www.audionautix.com<br />Royalty-Free Music by Twin Musicom at twinmusicom.org<br />I work with Amazon as an affiliate.
