{% raw %}I listen this beautiful song when i'm sad and tired. Pim's voice is really soothing, i feel better while listening to the song. Just wanted to share it with you cause i really love the song and the artist. A song that touches you. Hope you like it.<br /><br />Lyrics;<br /><br />Tell me this isn't true<br />Is this really the end?<br /><br />And as all the leaves rustle above us,<br />And as all the dirt covers our skin,<br />Rest your head onto my chest,<br />I'll tell you stories of the life we could have had.<br /><br />We danced bare-footed in the grass,<br />We read big heavy books and we would smile,<br />Our only drug was love,<br />And boy did we get high of how we smoked each other up.<br /><br />And as all the leaves rustle above us,<br />And as all the dark covers our skin,<br />Rest your head onto my chest,<br />I'll tell you stories of the life we could have had.<br /><br />My love my one true friend,<br />Is this really the end?<br />We worked hard and we made lots of money<br />And when we had enough to be happy we gave the rest away,<br />We didn't complain much, we were good with what we had,<br />How we were happy.<br /><br />And as all the leaves rustle above us,<br />And as all the cold buries our bones,<br />Rest your head onto my chest,<br />I'll tell you stories of the life we could have had.<br /><br />We traveled to lands and then we owned,<br />Found ourselves a boat and sailed into the sun,<br />How we were happy<br />In the life we could have had.<br /><br />Rest your head onto my chest<br />I'll tell you stories of the dream we could have lived,<br />Of the places we could have seen,<br />Of the things we could have done,<br />Of the people we could have been.<br /><br />Now if every word is a whisper,<br />And if every sound is a song,<br />And as all the leaves rustle above us<br />There's no moving on,<br />This is the end.<br /><br /><br />Resources: Pinterest, Inshot.{% endraw %}
