{% raw %}(800L)<br /><br />𝐂𝐑𝐄𝐃𝐈𝐓𝐒 -<br /><br />💌 Thank you,<br />@Valeria Martinez<br />for suggesting this article. 😊<br /><br /><br />𝐈𝐌𝐏𝐎𝐑𝐓𝐀𝐍𝐓 𝐈𝐍𝐅𝐎 -<br /><br />➡ Please slow down the video in the settings or pause if you think I am too fast. 😊<br /><br />➡ If your questions are different, that means that your lexile level is different from the lexile level in my video. However, what you can do is that you could understand the questions and answers provided in my video, (since questions for all the lexile levels have the same idea but are written in different ways), then put your answer in your activity based on the most logical answer, or the closest answer to mine. So, no worries.<br /><br />➡ If you see any links posted by BOTS in the comments, DO NOT click on them. They will cause a VIRUS on your device. I'm trying my best to delete all of the comments. 😕<br /><br />- 𝐄𝐍𝐃 -{% endraw %}
