{% raw %}We have been called into a very glorious life with high laws. God is very high and dwells in high and lofty places. He is calling us to where He is and we cannot arrive there except He sends the things which make Him dwell where He is. The people who will dwell with God must be of a contrite and humble spirit, contriteness and humility are the laws of His habitation.<br /><br />We are being called upwards and that should be our priority. Our calling is unto humility and lowliness in the heart and It takes power to configure such a heart.  Greatness in the realm of the spirit is measured by humility and meekness, however, we have been configured by the enemy to be proud and to think highly of ourselves in all ways.<br /><br />God is calling us to a high place so that He can confer authority upon us. We must therefore yield to the doctrine and dealings of Christ. These dealings will not harm us but will configure in us a stature that can ascend to where God dwells.<br /><br />#WEARELOVESEALCHURCH #REVHELEHOYEGOKE #ASCENSIONFEAST #SUNDAYSERVICE{% endraw %}
