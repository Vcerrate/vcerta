Instead of being stuck where you put him, he can roll his way across the room. It's one of the first big moves he makes and is a step on the path to crawling. You can help your baby build the muscles he needs to perform the roll even before he reaches the typical age range.<br />Gently rolling your baby from tummy to back or back to tummy can help her figure out the movement.
