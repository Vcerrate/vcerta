{% raw %}Amazon favs - Skincare, Makeup, Clothes, and Home Decor and a chance encounter that I will never forget. I am so glad I had a chance to preserve the moment on film. I share with you footage that I captured by accident of a girl in a gazebo...and what her faded smile represents to women of all ages.<br />It was a tough week...that happens in life! But I am so encouraged by what faith and love can do to heal a heart. <br />Thank you so much for being here and sharing your life with me and thank you to the wonderful ladies who are part of the heartbeat of this channel. <br />Thank you for your amazing comments that teach me and inspire future videos that I long to make.<br />Have a wonderful new week and know I love you to the moon and back again,<br />Susan &amp; Desi xxoo<br /><br />“When we are children we seldom think of the future. This innocence leaves us free to enjoy ourselves as few adults can. The day we fret about the future <br />is the day we leave<br />our childhood behind.”<br />                          ― Patrick Rothfuss, The Name of the Wind<br /><br />“It takes a very long time to become young.”<br />                                                                 ― Pablo Picasso<br /><br />____<br />Song You Hear: &quot;Soft Speak&quot;  by Sairate <br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2HhC9883U&amp;list=RDbg2HhC9883U&amp;start_radio=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2HhC9883U&amp;list=RDbg2HhC9883U&amp;start_radio=1</a><br />Epidemic Sound Catalog <br />__________<br />#DrDray #over60life  #susangraver<br /><br />✔ Dr. Drays Video On Facial Oils - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgmffkJNJLY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgmffkJNJLY</a><br /><br />✔ How I Came To Find 2 Dupes For Algenist - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://skinsort.com/products/algenist/dupes">https://skinsort.com/products/algenist/dupes</a><br /><br />FTC: This video is not sponsored.
