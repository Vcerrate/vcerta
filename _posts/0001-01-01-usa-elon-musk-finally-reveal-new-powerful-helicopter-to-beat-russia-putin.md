{% raw %}Tesla's   take   on   popular   modes   of   transport   is   always   exciting   and   hotly   anticipated!   For<br />instance,   Cybertruck,   which   takes   on   the   pickup   truck   in   an   electric   way,   has   reportedly<br />gathered more than a million pre-orders! However, there is another exciting electric vehicle that<br />Tesla is working on, and this time, the vehicle does not even move on land!<br />In this video, we will join Elon Musk as he reveals the insane Tesla's new helicopter!<br />Tesla only makes battery powered electric vehicles, which means when the company, through<br />its CEO, Musk, starts talking about a new vehicle category, it has got to be electric, except when<br />the vehicle is a rocket, though!<br />Musk's company has already established dominance in the EV space. It produces and sells the<br />most electric cars for a company. Its Model 3 is the best selling electric car, and is only being<br />threatened by another vehicle in Tesla's lineup, the Model Y. Tesla aims to be making 20 million<br />vehicles by 2030 and is building more Giga Factories to make this goal a reality. Tesla has also<br />massively improved its battery, which we will talk about later!{% endraw %}
