{% raw %}So, here's the description (I'm feeling just like in the first school day when your new teacher asks you to describe yourself and you can't think of something interesting while your other classmates have good ideas, so you end up being seen as a shy boring guy xd)<br />So, it's Mozart, yeah! um.....good music though! Talking seriously, he's extraordinary and I don't deserve to be the same species as him.<br />0:00 Symphony No. 40 in G minor, W. Mozart<br />8:20 Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, W. Mozart<br />14:04 Le Nozze Di Figaro: The Marriage of Figaro, W. Mozart<br />18:54 Don Giovanni Overture, W. Mozart<br />25:06 Symphony No. 25 in G minor, W. Mozart<br />32:54 Requiem in D minor, K.626 - Introitus, W. Mozart<br />38:21 Requiem in D minor, K.626 - Tuba mirum, W. Mozart<br />41:42 Requiem in D minor, K.626 - Recordare, W.
