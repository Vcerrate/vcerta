{% raw %}In this 8K ULTRA HD Video, we present beautiful animals in 8K with Nature sounds and Birds Sounds for Relaxation.<br /><br />Since we were little we are used to seeing the wonders of plants and flowers every day, we like to interact with domestic animals and know how to take care of them, feed them and protect them. In many cases, we become fond of them as if they were part of our family. Also from our childhood, we marvel at those animals that are wild and that move elegantly around our environment or in distant places looking for their food. We can observe them in places specially equipped for that, such as zoos or botanical parks, and it is necessary for humans to know how to maintain, conserve and care for these places and their inhabitants accordingly.<br />Nature is also present when we look at the landscape and we are amazed by its beauty when it rains and we watch the drops fall on our window. Sometimes we are scared by thunder and we are afraid of very violent and dangerous weather phenomena such as tornadoes, tidal waves, or earthquakes. The sensations that nature generates are endless. All this proves to us that our life is in a direct relationship with nature and although sometimes we believe that we no longer need it, it is in everything and we must take care of it.<br />From everything that has been established, it is clear that our relationship with nature is intrinsic. We could not exist without her, without all the resources and elements of her, without everything that makes her so perfect, beautiful, and dangerous. As rational beings, it is up to us to make the necessary effort so that everything that it offers us continues to exist in the most original conditions possible so that it continues to be a source of resources and beauty, so that other living beings can survive alongside us in the complex planet we live on.<br />It is important to understand then that caring for the environment will not only allow us to enjoy natural landscapes and everything that nature has created in millions of years of evolution, but it will also be a way of being able to take care of ourselves, as members of the said ecosystem, as those who need it and must protect it for their own well-being, avoiding imbalances that could end our survival, destroy the beauty and harmony of nature, leave indelible marks on it and endanger life. Our responsibility is total in the face of these problems and therefore we must act accordingly to ensure the life that belongs to us and that of other living beings that undergo these changes without being able to do anything about it.<br /><br />Follow me:<br />►YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8D_NXFBh8A9KSwo7x-wFdQ/">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8D_NXFBh8A9KSwo7x-wFdQ/</a><br />►Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bruno.saraviavega">https://www.facebook.com/bruno.saraviavega</a><br />►Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brunosaraviaphotography">https://www.instagram.com/brunosaraviaphotography</a><br /><br />Used Gear for this 8K VIDEO:<br />Canon - Sony - Nikon - Adobe Premiere Pro CC - Photoshop - Lightroom CC<br />Youtube Business - Youtube Profit - Bank Credit - Loans - Educational - Education<br /><br />CAPTIVATING NATURE in 8K ULTRA HD - Wildlife Videos with Nature Sounds Relaxing Music (FUHD) Demo 8K ULTRA HD<br /><br />#8K #ANIMALS #BIRDS{% endraw %}
