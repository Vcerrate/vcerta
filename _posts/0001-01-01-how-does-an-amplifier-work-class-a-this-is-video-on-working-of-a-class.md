{% raw %}This is video on working of a Class A Amplifier and some of its variations.<br /><br />The input signal is first filtered to remove any DC in it, then it is biased such that the signal stays in the active region of the transistor so that the current through the base is amplified at the collector, with amplification depending upon the gain of transistor and the resistors, at last the voltage at the collector is passed through the capacitor to remove the DC and provide the amplified input signal at the output.<br /><br />chapters<br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:15 - Designing the basic amplifier with working<br />03:40 - Different types of class A amplifiers<br />05:20 - Outro<br /><br />#Circuitaniamtion #3D_Animations #Amplifier{% endraw %}
