{% raw %}EXPLOSIVE footage allegedly shows the moment 'Russian drone strike destroys a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile system' near Kyiv.<br /><br />The Russian drone footage starts with the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) filming the target on the ground, which appears to be easily detectable, as it is located in what looks like a field.<br /><br />It then suddenly explodes in a large ball of fire, with smoke rising into the air. The area of impact is so large that the UAV camera has to zoom out to capture the whole explosion.<br /><br />Footage from the Russian Ministry of Defence claimed (in Russian) that the footage showed &quot;the destruction of a Buk anti-aircraft missile system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by high-precision missile weapons in the Kyiv region.&quot;<br /><br />The Sun newspaper brings you the latest breaking news videos and explainers from the UK and around the world<br /><br />Become a Sun Subscriber and hit the bell to be the first to know<br /><br />Read The Sun: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk">http://www.thesun.co.uk</a><br />Like The Sun on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thesun/">https://www.facebook.com/thesun/</a><br />Follow The Sun on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheSun">https://twitter.com/TheSun</a><br />Subscribe to The Sun on Snapchat: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.snapchat.com/discover/The_Sun/1633225139">https://www.snapchat.com/discover/The_Sun/1633225139</a><br />#Ukraine #Russia{% endraw %}
