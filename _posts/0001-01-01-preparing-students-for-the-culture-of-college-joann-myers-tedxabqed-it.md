{% raw %}It is essential for students to be academically prepared to enter college. However, JoAnn Myers believes they must also be prepared for the culture of college to success. She explains how this is especially essential for first generation college students.<br /><br />JoAnn has over 20 years of experience across the country as a classroom teacher, school psychologist, and building and district level administrator. She earned a B.A. in Elementary Education and Psychology, an M.Ed and an Ed.S in School Psychology, and a Certificate of Advanced Study in School Administration. After helping to start a charter school in NYC, JoAnn moved to Albuquerque to open her own school. JoAnn is a highly dedicated educator who deeply believes in people and is committed to creating educational equality. She leads her staff in providing life-changing opportunities to traditionally under-served student populations.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
