{% raw %}Dark Ambient and Drone Music with relaxing background undertones from Keosz<br />ðŸ‘‰ Bandcamp: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cryochamber.bandcamp.com/album/be-left-to-oneself">https://cryochamber.bandcamp.com/album/be-left-to-oneself</a><br />ðŸ‘‰ Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0ljttU8Uo6kPJVHa9J955S">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0ljttU8Uo6kPJVHa9J955S</a><br /><br />Erik Osvald serves us futuristic droneworks from the heart of Slovakia. The album Be Left to Oneself, takes us on a trip through sleeping cities kept lucid by neon lights. <br /><br />Combining deep bass driven subs with serene distorted overlays, this is crystal clear production served with an analogue touch.{% endraw %}
