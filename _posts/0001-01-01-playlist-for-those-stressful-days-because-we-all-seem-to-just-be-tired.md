{% raw %}hi! â™¡<br />I always feel like I should write something in the description but right now I don't know what to write here. Its almost the end of January and first of, how? how come 1 month of 2022 have passed already. and second, why am I so tired and stressed... Technically I'm still on my winter break so I know I should rest and not feel guilty about not doing anything but I just can't. It is so hard. I mean, I've watched like 4 TV shows and a couple of movies already, don't get me wrong, i'm not doing anything productive with my days. but I just simply cannot shake of the guilt. Guilt that I'm in med school, I should be studying even during the winter break, get ahead of the schedule etc.. I know that's a total nonsense, everybody needs to rest. and that i'm stressing myself out for no reason at all. I just- I don't know what point I'm trying to make. I guess... if you feel something similar know that you are not alone. <br />and if you still have exams ahead of you, or you started another semester already, I wish you the best of luck.  â™¡â™¡â™¡<br />Have a wonderful day/night<br />Take care, and stay healthy and remember that you are enough just the way you are.<br />love<br />nikiâ™¡<br /><br /><br /><br />Notes:<br />- Spotify link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3H4OHlLULZwIwrtVcgfDQl?si=d2971f4422ea4a1d">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3H4OHlLULZwIwrtVcgfDQl?si=d2971f4422ea4a1d</a><br /><br />-  if you want something similar iÂ´ve made this playlist and constantly update it with some chill music I find. This is playing in my room on shuffle basically every single day. Hope itÂ´ll help you find some new music â™¡â™¡â™¡<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6CEV7QoIq3WKVNhvi7LQLl?si=6d5baf8446ed4b59">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6CEV7QoIq3WKVNhvi7LQLl?si=6d5baf8446ed4b59</a><br /><br />- background picture: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mylivewallpapers.com/city/rain-on-window-2k-live-wallpaper/">https://mylivewallpapers.com/city/rain-on-window-2k-live-wallpaper/</a><br /><br />-  my ko-fi page (if you want you can tip me some money): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/sunsetdreams">https://ko-fi.com/sunsetdreams</a><br /><br /><br /><br />â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡<br />If you see ads on my videos I am sorry, I sadly can't do anything about it. I don't make any money off of them, it's monetized because of copyright - the money from ads goes to the song owners.<br /><br />To fix this you can:<br />a) go to the end of the video and then replay it from the beginning<br />b) install a good ad-block on your browser<br />c) or you can click here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtubeloop.net/,">https://youtubeloop.net/,</a> it will take you to the website where you just enter the URL and play it without ads . It is safe and it can also loop videos. â™¥<br />â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡<br /><br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: <br />None of these songs used to make this are mine.
