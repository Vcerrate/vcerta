{% raw %}The efficiency of your drivetrain can have a big impact on your speed. In this episode I talk with Josh Poertner about which chain lubes are the fastest and why, the efficiency difference between 1x and 2x drivetrains, and whether or not oversized pulley wheels are worth the upgrade. <br /><br />Get 15% of Silca products including the lubes discussed in this video when you use the code &quot;dylan&quot; at checkout: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://silca.cc/">https://silca.cc/</a><br /><br />Zero Friction Cycling: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://zerofrictioncycling.com.au/">https://zerofrictioncycling.com.au/</a><br /><br />Video on tire rolling resistance with Josh: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ZuxUWFziuGI">https://youtu.be/ZuxUWFziuGI</a>   <br /><br />Interested in coaching?
