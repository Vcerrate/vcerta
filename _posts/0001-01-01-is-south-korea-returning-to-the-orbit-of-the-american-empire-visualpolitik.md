The result was a political upheaval. Five years later, the conservatives are back in power. And they are not doing it with just any candidate. Yoon Seok-yeol will become the new president of South Korea, breaking what was already a tradition: the alternation of government between conservatives and progressives every 10 years.<br /> <br />Yoon Seok-yeol will be one of the most conservative, most pro-market, most pro-US presidents South Korea has had in decades. In this video we give you all the details about Moon Jae-in's political defeat and the huge political about-face the land of K-POP and the Squid Game has taken.<br /><br />üëâüëâ Do you like what we do? üèó Help us build VisualPolitik and receive the Weekly Snapshot, exclusive merchandising and much more:: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/VisualPolitik">https://www.patreon.com/VisualPolitik</a>{% endraw %}
