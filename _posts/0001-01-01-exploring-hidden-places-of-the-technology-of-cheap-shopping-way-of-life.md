New Delhi is the seat of all three branches of theÂ government of India, hosting theÂ Rashtrapati Bhavan,Â Parliament House, and theÂ Supreme Court of India.<br /><br />Although colloquiallyÂ DelhiÂ andÂ New DelhiÂ are used interchangeably to refer to theÂ National Capital Territory of DelhiÂ (NCT), these are two distinct entities, with New Delhi forming a small part of the city of Delhi. TheÂ National Capital RegionÂ is a much larger entity comprising the entireÂ NCTÂ along with adjoining districts in neighbouring states, includingÂ Ghaziabad,Â Noida,Â GurgaonÂ andÂ Faridabad.<br /><br />The foundation stone of New Delhi was laid byÂ George VÂ during theÂ Delhi Durbar of 1911.[6]Â It was designed by British architectsÂ Edwin LutyensÂ andÂ Herbert Baker. The new capital was inaugurated on 13 February 1931,[7]Â byÂ Viceroy and Governor-GeneralÂ Irwin.<br /><br />Until December 1911Â CalcuttaÂ was the capital of India during the British Rule. However, it had become the centre of the nationalist movements since the late nineteenth century, which led to theÂ Partition of BengalÂ by ViceroyÂ Lord Curzon. This created massive political and religious upsurge including political assassinations of British officials in Calcutta. The anti-colonial sentiments amongst the public led to a complete boycott of British goods, which forced the colonial government to reunite Bengal and immediately shift the capital to New Delhi.[8]<br /><br />Old DelhiÂ had served as the political and financial centre of several empires ofÂ ancient IndiaÂ and theÂ Delhi Sultanate, most notably of theÂ Mughal EmpireÂ from 1649 to 1857. During the early 1900s, a proposal was made to the British administration to shift the capital of the British Indian Empire, as India was officially named, from Calcutta on the east coast, to Delhi.[9]Â TheÂ Government of British IndiaÂ felt that it would be logistically easier to administer India from Delhi, which is in the centre of northern India.[9]Â The land for building the new city of Delhi was acquired under theÂ Land Acquisition Act 1894.[10]<br /><br />During theÂ Delhi DurbarÂ on 12 December 1911,Â George V,Â Emperor of India, while laying the foundation stone for the viceroy's residence in theÂ Coronation Park,Â Kingsway Camp, declared that the capital of the Raj would be shifted fromÂ CalcuttaÂ toÂ Delhi.[11][12][13][14]Â Three days later, George V and his consort,Â Queen Mary, laid the foundation stone of New Delhi at Kingsway Camp.[15]Â Large parts of New Delhi were planned byÂ Edwin Lutyens, who first visited Delhi in 1912, andÂ Herbert Baker, both leading 20th-century British architects.[16]Â The contract was given toÂ Sobha Singh. The original plan called for its construction in Tughlaqabad, inside theÂ Tughlaqabad Fort, but this was given up because of the Delhi-Calcutta trunk line that passed through the fort.[citation needed]Â Construction really began afterÂ World War IÂ and was completed by 1931. The gardening and planning of plantations was led byÂ A.E.P. Griessen, and later William Mustoe.[17]Â The city that was later dubbed &quot;Lutyens' Delhi&quot; was inaugurated in ceremonies beginning on 10 February 1931 by ViceroyÂ Lord Irwin.[18]Â Lutyens designed the central administrative area of the city as a testament to Britain'sÂ imperial aspirations.[19][20]<br /><br />Soon Lutyens started considering other places. Indeed, the Delhi Town Planning Committee, set up to plan the new imperial capital, withÂ George SwintonÂ as chairman, and John A. Brodie andÂ LutyensÂ as members, submitted reports for both north and south sites. However, it was rejected by the Viceroy when the cost of acquiring the necessary properties was found to be too high. The central axis of New Delhi, which today faces east atÂ India Gate, was previously meant to be a northâ€“south axis linking theÂ Viceroy's HouseÂ at one end withÂ PaharganjÂ at the other. Eventually, owing to space constraints and the presence of a large number of heritage sites on the north side, the committee<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Music credits:<br />Sanctuary by Scott Buckley | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/scottbuckley">https://soundcloud.com/scottbuckley</a><br />Music promoted by <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.free-stock-music.com">https://www.free-stock-music.com</a><br />Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0</a>{% endraw %}
