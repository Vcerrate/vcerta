{% raw %}This is a honest review of cheap vs expensive LED lights for 4wd 4x4 offroaders and overlanders.<br /><br />We had cheap LED lights, still have some on, and switched some for (very) expensive LED lights. The difference is huge! <br /><br />Big re-build of our Land Rover Defender during 2022 and a lot more to come. <br /><br />Enjoy the video, like, share, and comment below :)<br /><br />ðŸ”´ Subscribe for more free YouTube videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/offtrackfamil...">https://www.youtube.com/offtrackfamil...</a><br /><br />âœ…Our modified Defender 110 walk around: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/LDmCGM9r-u4">https://youtu.be/LDmCGM9r-u4</a><br /><br />Watch my most recent uploads: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXqjO...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXqjO...</a><br /><br />âœ… Recommended playlists:<br /><br />Equipment: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXqjO...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXqjO...</a><br /><br />Vlogs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yPFM...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yPFM...</a><br /><br />Overland Travels or Weekends: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK5fQ...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK5fQ...</a><br /><br />âœ… Let's connect:<br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/offtrackfam...">https://www.instagram.com/offtrackfam...</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/offtrackfam/">https://www.facebook.com/offtrackfam/</a><br /><br />âœ… Most of the gear &amp; clothing we use while 4wd overland:<br />FRâžœ www.amazon.fr/shop/offtrackfamily<br />UKâžœ working on it :)<br /><br />//New video every week!
