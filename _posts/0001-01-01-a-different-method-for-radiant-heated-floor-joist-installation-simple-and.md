{% raw %}Here is a method to retrofit radiant heat in an old house. This method requires no heat plates or fancy manifolds. The radiant tubing heats the space between the floor joist and warms the floor up. I have developed this method to simplify the process and save money so radiant heated floors can be more affordable. I consider this a good DIY method for installing your own radiant heat.{% endraw %}
