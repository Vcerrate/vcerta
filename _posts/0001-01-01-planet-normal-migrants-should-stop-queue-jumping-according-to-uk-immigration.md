Plus, he weighs in on whether Australia would ever remove the Queen as head of state.<br /><br />And, it’s three big cheers for the end of Covid restrictions, but only one and a half of those are for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. <br /><br />Allison fears the public mindset is now the biggest threat, and expects squeals about the end of restrictions from the 'lockdown is lovely' and ‘there’s no harm in being cautious’ classes. <br /><br />Liam Halligan is looking ahead to the public enquiry, and hopes it might teach us not to have a 'knee-jerk' response to any future pandemic.<br /><br />And, fond farewells are the order of the day as George, our secret NHS source, has one last update for our co-pilots and listeners. <br /><br />Read more from Allison Pearson: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/allison-pearson/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/allison-pearson/</a> <br /><br />Read more from Liam Halligan: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/liam-halligan/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/liam-halligan/</a> <br /><br />Read Annette’s late father Owen’s blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://annettejames1.wixsite.com/pottingshedtales">https://annettejames1.wixsite.com/pottingshedtales</a> |<br /><br />Listen to History Defended: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history-defended">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history-defended</a> <br /><br />Need help subscribing or reviewing?
