{% raw %}On the 29th of October 1998 a fire began inside a community centre in Gothenburg, Sweden. That night the venue was supposedly hosting a birthday party for around 50 people… but when the fire service arrived on scene they were confronted by an unexpected and horrifying reality: the building was packed with more than four times that number, many of whom were already beyond saving. <br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:38 - Background<br />03:08 - The Fire<br />07:31 - The Aftermath<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery. Fascinating Horror is all about in-depth research, respectful storytelling, and learning what we can from the mistakes of the past. You might be surprised to discover just how much of today's world is shaped by long-forgotten disasters from decades gone by.<br /><br />Music: &quot;Glass Pond&quot; by Public Memory | &quot;Underworld&quot; by Myuu<br /><br />► Like, comment and subscribe to keep up with my latest videos<br />► Know of an incident I should cover?
