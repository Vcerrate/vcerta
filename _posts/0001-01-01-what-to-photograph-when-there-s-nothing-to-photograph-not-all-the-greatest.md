{% raw %}Not all the greatest photographs were planned, or even expected. <br />Looking at everyday objects in a different way and creating truly amazing images is based on knowledge and understanding that you can learn by exploring this video.<br /><br />I never would have guessed that the one of the best fuel sources for my creativity and inspiration could be sitting right under my nose. <br /><br />üëâSave 10% on the Learning To See video course by using coupon START2022 till the end of February. üßê<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tpe.teachable.com/p/learning-to-see">https://tpe.teachable.com/p/learning-to-see</a><br /><br />Unfortunately, it was a little bit of ignorance that, at first, kept me from seeing all the variety of subject matter available. All it took, though, was a slight change in perspective to notice all sorts of things I had ignored for so long. Now I look differently at many things, from cars to chairs to pictures on the wall - anything you can think of. It's through this renewed view that we get to create some amazing images unlike any you've probably seen before.<br /><br />This video is about the difference between the way you look at *ordinary* things and the way that a photographer looks at the same thing. <br />By learning to see images in everyday objects, photographers open up whole new worlds of possibility.<br /><br />Chapters:<br />00:00 Lack of inspiration<br />00:23 Stop overlooking what's around you<br />01:37 Perspective<br />03:09 Everyday objects<br />06:28 Light<br />08:07 Combinations<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />üè´ For more in depth courses about improving your photography, plus image feedback and mentorship opportunities - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tpe.teachable.com/">https://tpe.teachable.com/</a><br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è I hope you find my content useful and inspiring.
