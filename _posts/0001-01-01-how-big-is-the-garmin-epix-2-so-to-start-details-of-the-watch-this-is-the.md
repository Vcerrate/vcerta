{% raw %}So to start, details of the watch, this is the: Garmin Epix™ (Gen 2) Sapphire 47mm - Black Titanium With Chestnut Leather Band. I am aware that in February 2022, frustratingly, this watch is not available globally in the US; for example, the closest you can get it is the:  Garmin epix™ (Gen 2) Sapphire - Black Titanium. The main difference other than the leather band is that the one I have has a grey top right button and mark on the screen on the top right, and the other has a red button and mark.<br /><br />If you are interested and want to help support the channel, if you follow this link, you can see it on Amazon: Garmin EPIX Gen 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/VB13C9L">https://geni.us/VB13C9L</a> <br /><br />So this watch is both fantastic and frustrating, fantastic because as expensive as it is, it does feel as it should, like a very premium device that offers a lot of day-to-day functionality. However, it is frustrating in that it only comes in one size. As it happens, I think this is the size I would get anyway, but the sister product, the Fenix 7 comes in 3 sizes. I don't understand why Garmin could not have produced this watch in different sizes, especially when they make the Venu in both a 2 and 2s. I am sure they will make more sizes in the future, but this is the only option today.<br /><br />With this in mind, I have created this video to talk about the watch's size and, importantly, my size and wrist size. It is a question that was asked in a previous Epix video, so I thought I would answer it in more detail. <br /><br />I hope you find this video of use; if you have any thoughts or questions, please leave them in the comments. <br /><br />If you have liked this video, please hit the like button and if you have got down here, please also consider subscribing if you have not already joined me on this YouTube journey.{% endraw %}
