{% raw %}In this video, I am harassed by an angry Karen that thinks his tree removal should be free.<br /><br />Our client in this video is a nonprofit organization fighting the epidemic of drug addiction in our country.  It is a former crackhouse now operating as a sober living home (Joes House) in honor of the founders deceased son who died of a drug overdose.  Hamms Arborcare has supported them in the past and has offered to be sponsor at this year’s fundraiser.  To give to this noble cause please visit  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bridgesofdodgeco.org">https://www.bridgesofdodgeco.org</a><br /><br />H<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="ttps://www.hammsarborcare.com">ttps://www.hammsarborcare.com</a><br /><br />Kevin Hamm ISA Board Certified Master Arborist WI-0317B is an arborist cut from the cloth of rugged individualism.  Never having worked in a tree company other than his own, he modeled himself after the teaching of Arboricultural legends Ken Palmer and Rip Tompkins and ArborMaster(R) Training.  After seeing them live at a day conference in the mid 1990’s in Wisconsin, the way they did it became the way it was done.  After attempting to launch a nationwide contractor model for tree care, Kevin returned again to an employee model in April of 2019.  He began by sending his son Taylor and Son-in-law Eli to an ArborMaster(R) Training to ensure the legacy of information would continue.  His company Hamm’s ArborCare, Inc. as of June 2021 is a TCIA Accredited Company.  We hope to bring the results of this heritage to our subscribers. Come join us at Game of Trees.{% endraw %}
