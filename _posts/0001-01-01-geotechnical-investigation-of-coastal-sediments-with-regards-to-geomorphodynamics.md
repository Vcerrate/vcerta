{% raw %}Geotechnical sediment properties in coastal and marine environments vary with local sediment dynamics, and vice versa affect sediment erodibility and depositional behavior. Thus, geotechnical properties are directly related to geomorphodynamics, including shoreline change in response to extreme events and sea level rise. Changes of geotechnical properties in coastal and marine environments resulting from sediment dynamics also potentially affects the integrity of coastal structures, engineering actions, naval activities, and/or habitats. It follows that there is a need for geotechnical investigations of coastal sediments with regards to active geomorphodynamics and its implications on above listed issues. Research towards filling this gap in knowledge requires the development of novel methods suitable for geotechnical site investigation in energetic coastal and marine environments, as well as a better understanding of the complex interaction between geotechnical properties and coastal processes. This presentation includes examples of latest efforts of method developments for the geotechnical investigation of coastal environments, as well as examples of geotechnical field data collections in areas affected by a variety of coastal processes and conditions. The presentation concludes with an outlook towards next steps and opportunities.<br /><br />Note that audio could not be recorded due to technical issues.{% endraw %}
