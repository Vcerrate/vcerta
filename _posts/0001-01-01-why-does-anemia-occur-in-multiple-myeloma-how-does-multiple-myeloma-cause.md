Of these, the white blood cells are further classified functionally as T and B lymphocytes. In normal conditions, the B lymphocytes, when activated, become plasma cells that produce antibodies (which are immunoglobulin type proteins) that are essential for fighting off the foreign antigens that invade the body.<br /><br />Immunoglobulins are heterodimeric proteins composed of two heavy (H) and two light (L) chains. Normal immunoglobulins are polyclonal in which the plasma cells produce immunoglobulins with a variety of heavy chains and each may be of kappa or lambda light chain type.<br /><br />In multiple myeloma, there is a malignant proliferation of plasma cells that produce abnormal immunoglobulins. In myeloma, plasma cells produce immunoglobulin of a single heavy and light chain, a monoclonal protein commonly referred to as a paraprotein. In most cases, an excess of light chain is produced. In some cases only light chain is produced; this appears in the urine as Bence Jones proteins and can be measured in the urine or serum as free light chain.<br /><br />Although a small number of malignant plasma cells are present in the circulation, the majority are present in the bone marrow.<br /><br />Features of multiple myeloma can be easily remembered using the mnemonic â€˜CRABâ€™ in which:<br /><br />â€˜Câ€™ stands for hyperCalcemia<br /><br />â€˜Râ€™ stands for Renal failure<br /><br />â€˜Aâ€™ stands for Anemia<br /><br />â€˜Bâ€™ stands for Bone pain<br /><br />Timestamps<br />0:00 Introduction<br />0:31 What is Multiple Myeloma?<br />3:19 What is Anemia?<br />4:27 What is Pancytopenia?<br />5:27 Why does anemia occur in Multiple Myeloma?<br />6:34 Why does pancytopenia occur in Multiple Myeloma?<br />7:33 See you again:){% endraw %}
