{% raw %}American Reporter Calls Ukraine 'Civilized’ as Opposed to Iraq and Afghanistan<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />#ukraine #iraq #Afghanistan #american #UkraineCrisis <br /><br />CBS foreign correspondent Charlie D’Agata is receiving blowback for describing Ukraine as “relatively civilized, relatively European” in comparison to countries like Iraq and Afghanistan on a Friday broadcast.<br /><br />Reporting from Kyiv, which is currently under siege by the Russian army, D’Agata described what he was witnessing. “Tens of thousands of people have tried to flee the city, there will be many more. People are hiding out in bomb shelters,” he said.<br /><br />“But this isn’t a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan, that has seen conflict raging for decades,” he commented.{% endraw %}
