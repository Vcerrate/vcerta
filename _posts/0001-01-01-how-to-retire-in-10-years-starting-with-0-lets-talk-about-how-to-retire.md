Remember, for every 5% of EXTRA income that you save…you’re able to retire up to SEVERAL YEARS EARLIER…so, every little bit counts. <br /><br />NUMBER FOUR: STAY AWAY FROM HIGH INTEREST DEBT<br />For myself, I make sure to NEVER carry a credit card balance…I never finance anything I can’t afford…and, I stay away from ANY DEBT that’s not a low interest, tax deductible, fixed rate car payment or mortgage under 4% interest...that’s IT. <br /><br />NUMBER SIX: INVEST CONSISTENTLY<br />-One, take advantage of your 401k, Roth IRA, and HSA accounts because these save you on taxes<br />-Two, Invest consistently, long term.<br />-Three, don’t time the market - just invest long term consistently, regardless of where the price is.<br />-Four, invest in a low-fee index fund that covers the entire market<br />-Five, wait. Let the markets do their thing - and, over time - you’ll make money. <br /><br />NUMBER SEVEN: INCOME<br />Your BEST CHANCE at being able to retire in 10 years, and make a LOT of money, is to work a job or a side hustle that pays on RESULTS, not your TIME. If you get paid based on your RESULTS - then, hypothetically, you should be able to find ways to streamline those results and make more money, without working any harder.<br /><br />I know some of this might be like “DUH!! TELL ME SOMETHING I DIDN’T KNOW” but…this is the truth….you MUST make enough money to be able to save 70-90% or more of your income for 10 years, and that’s the entire calculation, at it’s core, if you want to retire from nothing. <br /><br />I understand it’s not for everyone, and the idea of “retirement” sounds miserable…but, for me…that just means I have the choice to pursue the projects, work, and hobbies I find the most fulfilling… not that I’ll stop working and just relax all day doing nothing. To me, THAT’S what “early retirement” is all about...it’s the FREEDOM from being able to make a conscious choice, each and every day, in terms of how you’re going to spend your time…if it’s making more money and working, great. If it’s spending all day on YouTube…fine. But, at least that choice is YOURS…and, for 10 years of nonstop work…I can say, it’s absolutely worth it. <br /><br />My ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB">https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB</a><br /><br />For business or one-on-one real estate investing/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com<br /><br />*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
