{% raw %}Have you had a parent or partner in your life whose approval you wanted so badly yet always seemed out of reach?<br /><br />Did life feel more exciting or even more worth living when you were in the company of this person and much less so when away from him or her?<br /><br />Has the quest to become important to this person felt consuming yet impossible to achieve?  <br /><br />If you answered yes to any of these questions then you may have experienced narcissistic abuse in a particular form that preyed upon your hope for authentic connection to others.  In today’s video I want to explain how the promise of connection to someone you admire can become an all-consuming quest when that person is narcissistic.  The reason is that your pursuit of connection and hope to be important to him or her is used by them to inflate their own self-worth rather than connect to you.  And this is done by being able to see you as wanting to be with them more than they want to be with you.   And watch until the end, because I will offer an exercise to help you identify if you’re in a relationship like this or not.<br /><br />A link to my online course to Recover from Narcissistic Abuse:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jreidtherapy.com/narcissistic-abuse-course/">https://jreidtherapy.com/narcissistic-abuse-course/</a><br /><br />The link to my free webinar on '7 Self-Care Tools to Recover from Narcissistic Abuse':<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jreidtherapy.com/webinar-self-care/">https://jreidtherapy.com/webinar-self-care/</a><br /><br />Here's the link to my e-book on Surviving Narcissistic Abuse as the Scapegoat:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jreidtherapy.com/ebook-scapegoat-survivor/">https://jreidtherapy.com/ebook-scapegoat-survivor/</a><br /><br />Youtube series on Shame in recovery from Narcissistic Abuse:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/p4XmQhV54_g">https://youtu.be/p4XmQhV54_g</a><br /><br />Private Facebook Support Group that Accompanies the Online Course:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/recoverynarcabuse">https://www.facebook.com/groups/recoverynarcabuse</a><br /><br />Take the narcissistic emotional abuse quiz: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jreidtherapy.com/quiz/narc-abuse/">https://jreidtherapy.com/quiz/narc-abuse/</a>  <br /><br />Schedule a free 15-minute phone consultation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jreidtherapy.com/book-now">https://jreidtherapy.com/book-now</a><br /><br />Subscribe to my channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiW53MYnuTPjZ64M_fVzl-Q?sub_confirmation=1#jayreid">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiW53MYnuTPjZ64M_fVzl-Q?sub_confirmation=1#jayreid</a> #jayreidpsychotherapy{% endraw %}
