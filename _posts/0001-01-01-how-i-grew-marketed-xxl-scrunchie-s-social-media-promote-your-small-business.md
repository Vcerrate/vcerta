{% raw %}My most asked question, &quot;how did you get your name out there when you first started?!&quot;. This video is LONG.. but I truly got to say what I would say if we were to be able to talk face-to-face. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è<br /><br />P.S. MATCH MY FLANNEL HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://xxlandco.com/collections/tops/products/kalyna-flannel">https://xxlandco.com/collections/tops/products/kalyna-flannel</a><br />Or match my Dani XXL Scrunchie HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://xxlandco.com/products/dani-buffalo-plaid?_pos=1&amp;_psq=dani&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0">https://xxlandco.com/products/dani-buffalo-plaid?_pos=1&amp;_psq=dani&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0</a><br />Or the Dani Mini Scrunchie HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://xxlandco.com/products/dani-mini">https://xxlandco.com/products/dani-mini</a><br /><br />Handmade and/or designed by yours truly!<br /><br />These are all the social media channels I use, how I use them and how I first advertised for my small business. I'm SUPER grateful to have connected with this community of friends I like to call the XXL FAM. I am also proud of all the work I've put in! I try to make every day count. Consistency is VITAL.<br /><br />I really hope this video helps at least ONE person out there get started with their dreams. Social media doesn't have to be overwhelming! Without it, I would not have gotten my business out there!! If I can do it. YOU CAN TOO. ‚ù§üòä <br /><br />If you have a dream, an idea, or something you've been wanting to start for a while... JUST. START. Your chances of success are much higher if you start!<br /><br />WITH LOVE, always <br />Tina and The XXL Team.<br />Xx<br /><br />‚ú© Join the XXL Family ‚ú©<br />‚Üí Shop <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://xxlandco.com/‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã">http://xxlandco.com/‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã</a><br />‚Üí Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/xxl.scrunchie">http://www.instagram.com/xxl.scrunchie</a><br />‚Üí TikTok <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@xxl.scrunchie?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@xxl.scrunchie?lang=en</a><br /><br /> ‚ú©  Join Our Newsletter ‚ú©  <br />Become an XXL VIP to get special offers, restock alerts and first dibs on new releases! ‚Üí <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://xxlandco.com/apps/seguno/subscribe">https://xxlandco.com/apps/seguno/subscribe</a><br /><br />‚ú©  Business inquiries ‚ú©<br />‚Üí support@xxlandco.com<br /><br />‚ú© Amazon links ‚ú©<br />Shop my Amazon affiliate links to support us!
