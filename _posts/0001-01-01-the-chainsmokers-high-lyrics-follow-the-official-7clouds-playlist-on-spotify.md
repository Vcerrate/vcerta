You only say you love me when you're high<br />It's like we go through the same shit every night<br />Oh, why? Oh, why?<br />You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does<br />Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high<br />It's like we go through the same shit every night<br />Oh, why? Oh, why?<br />You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does<br /><br />[Verse 1]<br />Tell me that you're gonna change, then act like this instead<br />I'm too old to want somebody who's always switching up their friends<br />I can't make you love me, but at least you could pretend<br />Scrips gonna lead to fifths until I'm fucked out of my head<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus]<br />You play the same old songs<br />I know that you're different in your Air Force 1s<br />Filling my prescription, I could bite your tongue<br />Like I got an addiction, yeah<br />You always say that shit's gonna change, but it never does<br />[Chorus]<br />Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high<br />It's like we go through the same shit every night<br />Oh, why? Oh, why?<br />You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does<br />Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high<br />It's like we go through the same shit every night<br />Oh, why? Oh, why?<br />You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />I know it's my fault, I pick up your phone calls<br />When it's half-past one, and you're halfway drunk<br />You say you love me, and it sounds so dumb<br />But you're the only one I can't run away from<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus]<br />The same old songs<br />I know that you're different in your Air Force 1's<br />Filling my prescription, I could bite your tongue<br />Like I got an addiction, yeah<br />You always say that shit's gonna change, but it never does<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Why? You only say you love me when you're high<br />It's like we go through the same shit every night<br />Oh, why? Oh, why?<br />You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does<br />Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high<br />It's like we go through the same shit every night<br />Oh, why? Oh, why?<br />You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does<br />[Outro]<br />(You'll only say you love me when you're h-h-h-, it never does)<br />You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does<br /><br />.........<br />üì∑ Wallpaper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unsplash.com/">https://unsplash.com/</a><br />.........<br />üìß Contact / Demo Submissions: contact@7clouds.org<br />.........<br />üíå Demos / Music Submissions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com">https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com</a><br />.........<br />üìù Licensing / Sync Requests: licensing@7clouds.org<br />.........<br /><br />#TheChainsmokers  #High #Lyrics{% endraw %}
