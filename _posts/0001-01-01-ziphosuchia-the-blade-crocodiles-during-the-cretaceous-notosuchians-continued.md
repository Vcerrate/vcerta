{% raw %}During the Cretaceous, Notosuchians continued their radiation on the southern continents. We’ve already examined the dog-like basal members of this lineage in a previous video, and today I’ll be focusing on the more derived and extensive Ziphosuchia clade. Meaning blade crocodiles, referring to the thin slashing teeth of the carnivorous members of this group, in reality Ziphosuchians were highly diverse and also included herbivorous and omnivorous forms as well. Some genera were truly bizarre, with complex tooth structures at times very similar to those of mammals. The derived Sebecosuchians survived the K-PG extinction event in South America, remaining large predators that managed to successfully prey on the continent's endemic ungulates. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.deviantart.com/drpolaris/">https://www.deviantart.com/drpolaris/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/DrPolaris">https://www.patreon.com/DrPolaris</a><br /><br />All copyrighted images/footage/music is protected under Fair Use for reasons of criticism, commentary, social satire, and education.<br /><br />All copyrighted images belong to their respected owners.
