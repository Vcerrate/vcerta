{% raw %}I hear these kind of screams<br />as well as whole lot of other things <br />in the hospital that I have worked at<br />for many years.<br /><br />Some patients with it<br />can even get combative<br />and hit nurses<br />they get so scared.<br /><br />The nurses take it like a champ<br />maintaining their composure<br /> and professionalism <br />throughout it<br />while their face is bright red,<br />and go on to the next patient<br />they are assigned to care for.<br /><br />It really makes one value <br />one's own health even more,<br />besides feeling bad for the patients<br />and for all the staff and carers involved.<br /><br />Hope your grandma<br />as well as your mom <br />are doing alright.<br /><br />We understand <br />why you felt you had to leave last night,<br />just to make sure that everything's alright,<br />even though your mom got it.<br /><br />You are such a kind, caring person,<br />with such a good heart.<br />She is fortunate to have<br />a granddaughter like you.<br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m.twitch.tv/eugeniacooney/home">https://m.twitch.tv/eugeniacooney/home</a><br />#eugeniacooney{% endraw %}
