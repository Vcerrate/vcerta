{% raw %}It might be surprising to know that in electric trains, the power collected from the overheadlines ends up in the grounding cable of the track after flowing through the wheels. Three phase power conversion, regenerative braking and zig-zag overheadlines - all these make electric train technology quite unique. Letâ€™s understand all the engineering secrets behind the electric trains starting from the simplest design possible.<br /><br />LinkedIn : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabin-mathew/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabin-mathew/</a><br />Be our supporter or contributor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqZQJ4600a9wIfMPbYc60OQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqZQJ4600a9wIfMPbYc60OQ/join</a><br />instagram : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sabinzmathew/">https://www.instagram.com/sabinzmathew/</a><br />Twitter : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/sabinsmathew">https://twitter.com/sabinsmathew</a><br />Telegram : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/sabinmathew">https://t.me/sabinmathew</a><br />FB : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SabinzMathew">https://www.facebook.com/SabinzMathew</a><br /><br />Voice over artist : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fiverr.com/cbrown006">https://www.fiverr.com/cbrown006</a>{% endraw %}
