Soak the gelatin in cold water for 5 minutes. <br />2. Bring the water and sugar to a simmer in a large saucepan then remove it from the heat. Squeeze out any excess water in the gelatin, then add it to the water and stir until dissolved. Stir in the Chartreuse. <br />3. Pour the liquid into a well greased mold, then refrigerate for 1-3 hours, or until the jelly is beginning to thicken. <br />4. To remove the skin from the peaches, score and X at the bottom of the peaches, then plunge into boiling water for 45 seconds, then immediately into ice cold water for 10 seconds. If the peaches are ripe, the skin should easily slide off. Remove the pit and slice.<br />5. Heat the simple syrup to simmering, then add the peach slices. Coat and turn off the heat and let them cool in the syrup. <br />6. Carefully insert the peaches into the jelly in whatever pattern you like. Then return to the refrigerator until fully set. 8 - 24 hours depending on the depth of the mold. <br />7. Once set, run a knife around the edge of the jelly, then dip the mold into hot (not boiling) water for 5 seconds. Remove it and place a well greased plate over the top of the mold then flip it over. The jelly should fall out with little more than a tap. <br />8. Top with Italian meringue or whipped cream, and serve.  <br /><br />**Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Tasting History will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
