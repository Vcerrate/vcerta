However, this does not impact my opinions, demos and reviews. Small commissions can help me as a small YouTuber purchase as many products as possible to review and make videos for. Also brands sometimes send me their products for free to review but I have never been told to say positive things about their products nor would I if they had asked.{% endraw %}
