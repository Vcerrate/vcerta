{% raw %}This extremely compact Everyday Carry urban pack contains essentials to help get you out of trouble when out of the house.  Small enough to carry with you everywhere, clever enough to save the day.<br /><br />My name is Jonathan, I have a passion for all things 'gadget, travel and EDC' which has filled both my personal and work life for many years.  This includes sourcing, reviewing and product development and the creation of two UK national retail chains.  Find out more here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/vYCOQ5CpkXY">https://youtu.be/vYCOQ5CpkXY</a><br /><br />This channel is here to help you find great travel and carry gear on the back of solid and detailed reviews along with years of experience.  I also hope to give you ideas and inspiration when it comes to everyday carry gear, travel gear and gadgets, which make life a little bit easier and perhaps more fun.<br /><br />I welcome any feedback on my videos or the channel in general.

If you purchase a product or service with the links that I provide I may receive a small commission. There is no additional charge to you.<br /><br />Comments:<br /><br />I really appreciate the feedback in the comments - I find it a source of knowledge and inspiration - so thank you to all of you who take the time to contribute.  I have recently found that if I continue to respond to all the comments as the number of videos builds, it takes time away from being able to produce new content which would be very counter productive! - so my aim is to read everything I can and reply when I can, after each video goes live, until the next video goes live a week later.  I'll see how that works out üòä<br /><br />All the best Jon Gadget{% endraw %}
