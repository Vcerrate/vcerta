{% raw %}Clogged arteries result from the build-up of a substance called plaque in the arterial walls. It is also medically referred to as arterial plaque. This plaque can reduce blood flow or even block it altogether.<br />Clogged arteries increase your risk of developing other health complications like a heart attack or stroke. <br /> <br />Some of the most common risk factors for clogged arteries are:<br />High levels of LDL (bad cholesterol) or low levels of HDL (good cholesterol)<br />A high blood pressure<br />Smoking tobacco<br />Diabetes or elevated blood sugar levels<br />A family history of atherosclerosis or clogged arteries<br />Stress<br />Obesity<br />A sedentary lifestyle<br /><br />Most cases of clogged arteries do not exhibit any symptoms until a heart attack or blood clot presents itself.
