{% raw %}Routing instances, like VRF-Lite, create additional routing tables on a router or layer-3 switch. This is often used to keep traffic separate, much like a VLAN separated traffic at layer-2.<br /><br />There are several types of routing instances. The virtual router is like VRF-Lite. The no-forwarding type is similar, but does not create a separate forwarding table as well (the default forwarding table is used).<br />The VRF and L2VPN types are used with MPLS, and the forwarding type is used with filter based forwarding (AKA PBR).<br /><br />Study notes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://networkdirection.net/study-notes/routing-instances">https://networkdirection.net/study-notes/routing-instances</a><br />Transcript: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://networkdirection.net/study-notes/introduction-to-juniper-transcripts/routing-instances">https://networkdirection.net/study-notes/introduction-to-juniper-transcripts/routing-instances</a><br />Quizzes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://networkdirection.net/labsandquizzes/quizzes/juniper-jncia/routing-instances">https://networkdirection.net/labsandquizzes/quizzes/juniper-jncia/routing-instances</a><br />Labs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://networkdirection.net/labsandquizzes/labs/jncia-labs/routing-instances">https://networkdirection.net/labsandquizzes/labs/jncia-labs/routing-instances</a><br /><br /><br />Overview of this video:<br /><br />0:00 Introduction<br /><br />0:20 VRF-Lite Recap<br /><br />2:19  Creating Routing Instances<br /><br />3:24 Configuration<br /><br /><br />Patreon information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://networkdirection.net/patreon/">https://networkdirection.net/patreon/</a><br /><br /><br />Further Reading:<br />Juniper Routing Instances - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://networkdirection.net/articles/routingandswitching/juniper-routers-and-switches/juniper-routing-instances/">https://networkdirection.net/articles/routingandswitching/juniper-routers-and-switches/juniper-routing-instances/</a><br />Routing Instances Overview - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/routing-instances-overview.html">https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/routing-instances-overview.html</a><br /><br /><br />LET'S CONNECT<br /><br />üåè <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/networkdirection">https://www.youtube.com/c/networkdirection</a><br /><br />üåè <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/NetwrkDirection">https://twitter.com/NetwrkDirection</a><br /><br />üåè <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/NetworkDirection">https://www.patreon.com/NetworkDirection</a><br /><br />üåè <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.networkdirection.net">https://www.networkdirection.net</a><br /><br />#NetworkDirection<br />#networking<br />#Juniper{% endraw %}
