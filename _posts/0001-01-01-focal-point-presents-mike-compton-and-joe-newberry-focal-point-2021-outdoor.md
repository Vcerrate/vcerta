{% raw %}FOCAL POINT 2021 OUTDOOR CONCERT SERIES<br /><br />Focal Point Friends of Old-Time Music Present: Compton &amp; Newberry: A Return to the Roots of Bluegrass<br /><br />Mike Compton and Joe Newberry mine one of the more neglected segments of country music history: the period during the ‘30s and ’40s when brother duet music was transitioning into what is known today as bluegrass. Both masters of the bedrock instruments of old-time music, they collaborate with a vision that is both modern and ageless. As virtuosos of old-time mandolin, banjo, and guitar, they dig deep into early country music and blues. Given their seemingly limitless library of brother duets, audiences can expect to hear their favorite tunes along with traditional instrumentals, mother ballads, and award-reaping originals. Their combined pedigree has enabled them to reach millions of people, including the more than four million regular listeners of A Prairie Home Companion and also the devoted fans of the Grammy Award-winning O Brother, Where Art Thou and Cold Mountain soundtracks.{% endraw %}
