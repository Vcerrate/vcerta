{% raw %}Many students can be intimidated by cross wind landings but winds are part of flying and it's important to know how to land safely in cross wind conditions and we aim to help those students in this video. <br /><br />If cross wind landings are an expansion to your existing personal minimums, be sure to understand how to expand those personal minimums safely by watching our video on Risk Management and Personal Minimums here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/xDueNYtLCfg">https://youtu.be/xDueNYtLCfg</a><br /><br />This video will help you understand the two methods of completing crosswind landings. These methods are &quot;the crab&quot; and &quot;the side slip&quot; which can also be referred to as &quot;the low wing method&quot;. <br /><br />At AeroGuard, our instructors teach the side slip, or low wing, method due to it being a safer way of learning since you are always aligned with the runway and it allows your sight picture to stay the same.{% endraw %}
