{% raw %}Can You Beat Dying Light 2 WITHOUT Weapons? After years of training, here is the result. Dying Light 2 pushed my resolve to the maximum.<br /><br />Follow my social medias or I throw you in jail:<br />Follow me on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/danteravioliyt">https://www.instagram.com/danteravioliyt</a><br />Follow me on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DanteRavioli">https://twitter.com/DanteRavioli</a><br /><br />Dying Light 2 was an incredibly fun game and I enjoyed my time with it. Sure, the story could've used some more work, but at the end of it all, I got to meet my man Hakon so no complaints from me. This gaming challenge is officially my longest narrated piece of all time (I think it came out to over 10 pages) so I hope you guys enjoy this one! I put a lot of work into it, especially when it came to the music. Let me know if you enjoyed Dying Light 2 down in the comments. I'd like to hear everyone's opinion on it.<br /><br />Watch some of my other videos here:<br />I tried beating Dying Light With Only Throwables - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/y9JsUixoa80">https://youtu.be/y9JsUixoa80</a><br />Can You Beat Dying Light With Only Broken Weapons? - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/H386HuBbtOQ">https://youtu.be/H386HuBbtOQ</a><br />I Tried Beating Resident Evil 4 VR Shotgun Only - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/1sXkOyVRAoY">https://youtu.be/1sXkOyVRAoY</a><br /><br />Watch my other gaming challenges here:<br />I tried beating God of War Fists Only - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/30eOqW_YSAY">https://youtu.be/30eOqW_YSAY</a><br />Can You Beat Dying Light WITHOUT Weapons? - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/va-R8G-rlts">https://youtu.be/va-R8G-rlts</a><br />Can You Beat The Last of Us Without Taking Damage? - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/0gnliOipXyk">https://youtu.be/0gnliOipXyk</a><br /><br />Music used:<br /><br />The Dream Continues / The Legend of Heroes: Sora no Kiseki SC Original Sound Track / Copyright© Nihon Falcom Corporation<br />Silver Will, Golden Wings (Less Vocal) / Sora wo Miagete -The Legend of Heroes: Sora no Kiseki Vocal Version / Copyright© Nihon Falcom Corporation<br />Firm Strength / The Legend of Heroes: Zero no Kiseki Original Soundtrack / Copyright© Nihon Falcom Corporation<br />Advancing Bravery / The Legend of Heroes: Zero no Kiseki Original Soundtrack / Copyright© Nihon Falcom Corporation<br />Cradle Where Feelings Rest / The Legend of Heroes: Sora no Kiseki the 3rd Original Sound Track / Copyright© Nihon Falcom Corporation<br />Silver Will ~The Bladelord's Hit~ / The Legend of Heroes: Sora no Kiseki The Animation Original Soundtrack CD / Copyright© Nihon Falcom Corporation<br />The Whereabouts of Hope / The Legend of Heroes: Sora no Kiseki SC Original Sound Track / Copyright© Nihon Falcom Corporation<br />The Whereabouts of Bonds / The Legend of Heroes: Sora no Kiseki SC Original Sound Track / Copyright© Nihon Falcom Corporation<br /><br />If you enjoy watching gaming challenge videos, be sure to subscribe to my channel because I make new gaming challenge videos every week/month/year and I have tons of great content on my channel!
