{% raw %}When Ukraine successfully targeted Russia's prized warship last month with anti-ship cruise missiles, it had some help from the United States. Ukrainian forces, having spotted the Russian warship in the Black Sea, called their American contacts for confirmation that it was in fact the Moskva, sources familiar with the events told CNN. The US responded that it was, and provided intelligence about its location. #CNN #News{% endraw %}
