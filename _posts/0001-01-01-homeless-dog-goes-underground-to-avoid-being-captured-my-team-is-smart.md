{% raw %}My team is smart and figured out how to outsmart the dog 😎🐶😎<br />With your support, we can accomplish many more rescues. We would LOVE it if you would join us as a member today here with a donation of just $5 a month here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.HopeForPaws.org">https://www.HopeForPaws.org</a><br /><br />JoAnn Wiltz and Alex Babcock had to go twice to this rescue location - the first time they learned her behavior, and the second time they were ready for her.<br /><br />Mimi is now fostered by our friends at L.A. Animal Rescue, so if you would like to adopt her, please contact them here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.LAAR.org">https://www.LAAR.org</a><br /><br />If you missed our previous video of Fortuna, please check it out here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMyC4wfQP9s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMyC4wfQP9s</a><br /><br />Thank you so much!<br /><br />Eldad<br />#HopeForPaws #LAAnimalRescue #dog{% endraw %}
