{% raw %}What causes prostate cancer? The answer is not always easy to find. Experts believe there is a genetic link in some cases. There have also been links to chemical exposure such as Agent Orange. Racial background can also be a factor. American men of African descent are more at risk, as are men of European descent. Men with Asian heritage are somewhat less likely to have prostate cancer.<br /><br />More answers about how prostate cancer is treated and researched can be found at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nebraskamed.com/Cancer/Prostate-Cancer.">http://www.nebraskamed.com/Cancer/Prostate-Cancer.</a> <br /><br />You can also call The Nebraska Medical Center at 1-800-922-0000.{% endraw %}
