Whether you're tailgating safely camping or just enjoying a day out with the family. Smoking meats is one of the best ways to make flavorful juicy meat. So today we'll be looking at the best outdoor smokers and break them down by their features and benefits, you can get an idea of which of these might be the best choice for you based upon your particular situation. And as always, I'll include links to each of these down below so you can check for updated pricing and availability for any of these that you might be interested in. Also, if there are any coupon codes discount special deals available on any of these, I'll include that in the description as well. So all smokers produce that juicy smoky flavor and meats, they don't all achieve it in the same fashion and there are a number of things that go into making a really good outdoor smoker. And the best overall outdoor smoker that we came across was the masterbilt nB 2007 3519 bluetooth digital electric smoker and this particular electric smoker for masterbilt takes all the guesswork out of the process. It's got a built in probe thermometer that helps ensure perfectly smoke meat every time. But that's just one of its many bells and whistles. It also has bluetooth technology allows the operator to adjust the temperature, adjust the lighting the power even check the meat temperature from your phone. This smokers electric power source makes ignition and maintaining precise temperatures a real cinch because it's automatically calibrated. You don't have to worry about gas or propane. It's got a side loaning woodchip reservoir that makes it really easy to refuel without losing heat which is important for keeping the temperature slow and low. The only downside that is obviously because it's electric. You don't want to use it in wet conditions but otherwise and if you want to make that smoky, succulent meat then the best overall outdoor smoker that we found to do it was the masterbilt nB 2007 3519 bluetooth digital....ran out of the 5k characters limit, sorry guys.<br /><br />-DISCLOSURE-<br /><br />I am affiliated, but not sponsored by any product featured in this video.
