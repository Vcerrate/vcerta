Purchase and Stream Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ffm.to/theshapeofpunktocome">https://ffm.to/theshapeofpunktocome</a><br /><br />Lyrics<br />Can I scream? <br />It’s here for us to admire if we can afford the beauty of it. If we can afford the luxury of turning our heads. If we can adjust that $1000 smile and behold the creation of man. Great words won’t cover ugly actions and good frames won’t save bad paintings. <br />We lack the motion to move to the new beat. When the day is over the doors are locked on us. Cause money buys the access and we can’t pay the cost. And how can we expect anyone to listen if we are using the same old voice? We need new noise, new art for the real people. <br />We lack the motion to move to the new beat. <br />We dance to all the wrong songs and we enjoy all the wrong moves. We are not leading. Yeah. The new beat x10000 <br /><br /><br />Official Site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://officialrefused.com/​">http://officialrefused.com/​</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RefusedBand​">https://www.facebook.com/RefusedBand​</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/refused​">https://twitter.com/refused​</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/refused">https://www.instagram.com/refused</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/3tfiHC7">https://spoti.fi/3tfiHC7</a><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29RWzZKOHojA6bfWe8KZMg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29RWzZKOHojA6bfWe8KZMg</a><br /><br />Epitaph Records is an artist-first indie label founded in Los Angeles by Bad Religion guitarist, Brett Gurewitz. Early releases from a variety of punk heavyweights helped launch the 90s punk explosion.  Along the way, Epitaph has grown and evolved creatively while sticking to its mission of helping real artists make great recordings on their own terms.<br /><br />#Refused #Epitaph #TheShapeOfPunkToCome<br /><br />_______________{% endraw %}
