{% raw %}The beginning part of Chicken-out-Ridge, a class 3 scrambling section to Borah Peak in Salmon-Challis National Forest in Idaho. Taken from my drone to show a different perspective. Unfortunately, the follow function of my drone didnâ€™t work too well, so I had to correct it twice in the middle.<br />For log of my entire trip up Borah peak, head to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.huangyizhou.com/index.php/2020/07/21/20200721borah/">http://www.huangyizhou.com/index.php/2020/07/21/20200721borah/</a>{% endraw %}
