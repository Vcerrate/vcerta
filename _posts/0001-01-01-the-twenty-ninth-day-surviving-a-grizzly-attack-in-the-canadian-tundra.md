{% raw %}Outdoor Adventure Expo - Virtual Presentation<br />Wednesday, November 21st 5:15pm<br /><br />Presented By:   Alex Messenger<br /><br /><br />A six-hundred-mile trip in the Canadian wilderness is a seventeen-year-old's dream adventure, but after he is mauled by a grizzly bear, it's all about staying alive.<br /><br />This true-life wilderness survival epic recounts seventeen-year-old Alex Messenger's near-lethal encounter with a grizzly bear during a canoe trip in the Canadian tundra.  The story follows Alex and his five companions as they paddle north through harrowing rapids and stunning terrain.<br /><br />Twenty-nine days into the trip, while out hiking alone, Alex is attacked by a barren-ground grizzly.  Left for dead, he wakes to find that his summer adventure has become a struggle to stay alive.  Over the next hours and days, Alex and his companions tend to his wounds and use their resilience, ingenuity, and dogged perseverance to reach help at a remote village a thousand miles north of the US-Canadian border.<br /><br />The Twenty-Ninth Day is a coming-of-age story like no other, filled with inspiring subarctic landscapes, thrilling riverine paddling, and a trial-by-fire of the human spirit.{% endraw %}
