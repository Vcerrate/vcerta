THE LORD HAS DONE IT AGAIN <br /><br />“And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.”<br />‭‭Luke‬ ‭17:15-19‬ ‭KJV‬‬<br /><br /><br />I have come with praise, thanksgiving and worship.
