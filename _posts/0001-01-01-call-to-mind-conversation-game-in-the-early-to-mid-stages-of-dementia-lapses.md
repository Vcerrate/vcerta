{% raw %}In the early- to mid-stages of dementia, lapses in memory and episodes of confusion may begin to affect the way in which a person communicates with their family and friends. Feeling frustrated, helpless and unsure of themselves, they may choose to withdraw rather than risk an upsetting situation. When this happens, finding things to talk about can be a struggle. As a carer, you may worry about saying the wrong thing, choosing instead to say nothing. This is a mistake and the absence of conversation can have a negative impact on the wellbeing of the person in question. Why not try playing a specially designed game together instead?<br /><br />Call to Mind is a brilliant game conceived by Angela Newton, an occupational therapist working in elderly care, in conjunction with University College London’s Professor of Psychiatry of Older People, Gill Livingston, and brought to market by Angela’s sister, Laura. Designed to help the person with dementia to connect with, and to recall, positive personal memories, inspiring conversations and making it easier for them to enjoy quality time with family, friends and carers across all generations. The game can also boost the morale and self-esteem of the individual with dementia, particularly when other players show genuine interest in their opinions and experiences.<br /><br />Best used in the early-to-mid stages of dementia, or when somebody has mild cognitive impairment, this game is extremely easy to play. Simply spin the spinner and choose one of four colour coded cards, matching an image and answering a question. Two to four players can easily sit round the board together and it is not necessary for the full game to be played in order to enjoy or benefit from it. The question cards, alone, can be used to stimulate conversations across a range of topics and so make communication easier. Often, questions are about things that an older person might not have discussed for a while, such as a holiday they particularly enjoyed or where they grew up. This can prompt distinct memories. As well as stimulating the mind, playing the game also exercises the senses, hand movement and speech.{% endraw %}
