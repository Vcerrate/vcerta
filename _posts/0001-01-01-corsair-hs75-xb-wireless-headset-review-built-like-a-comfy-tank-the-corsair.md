{% raw %}The Corsair HS75 XB is a surprisingly solid headset wireless Xbox headset.  Even though it lacks some features others have in this price point such as aux input, Bluetooth, and multi-console support, it makes up for it in build quality and comfort.  This is easily the best built wireless Xbox headset I've used outside of the $500 Bang &amp; Olufsen Beoplay Portals.  That says a lot considering the MRSP is $150.  The microphone is also class-leading with incredible warmth and detail, without any of the common walkie-talkie effect some wireless headsets are plagued with.  Out of the box sound performance is bass forward and laid back, but the lifetime Dolby Atmos license lets you tune the headset to get the most out of it.<br /><br />If this is the right headset for you, you can purchase it here (Amazon Affiliate):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3pEC5rt">https://amzn.to/3pEC5rt</a><br /><br />Follow us on Twitter!   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GadgetryTechJoe">https://twitter.com/GadgetryTechJoe</a><br />Follow us on Instagram!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gadgetrytech/">https://www.instagram.com/gadgetrytech/</a><br />Follow us on Facebook! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GadgetryTech">https://www.facebook.com/GadgetryTech</a><br /><br />Chapters:<br />0:00 - Intro and Features<br />02:36 - Controls<br />06:05 - Mic Test<br />08:22 - Sound Quality<br />11:48 - Comfort and Build Quality<br />15:20 - Final Thoughts<br /><br />Want us to review something?
