{% raw %}During the Late Carboniferous, as the amniotes were beginning their radiation, one particular and very successful lineage emerged. These were the Sauropsids, the sister lineage of the early Synapsids that we looked at in the last video. Sauropsida at this time encompassed the common ancestors of what we would consider reptiles today, including the Squamates, Tuatara, Turtles and Archosaurs. The most ancient Sauropsids were small and relatively marginal lizard-like animals that inhabited the humid swamp forests of the Carboniferous world.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.deviantart.com/drpolaris/">https://www.deviantart.com/drpolaris/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/DrPolaris">https://www.patreon.com/DrPolaris</a><br /><br />All copyrighted images/footage/music is protected under Fair Use for reasons of criticism, commentary, social satire, and education.<br /><br />All copyrighted images belong to their respected owners.
