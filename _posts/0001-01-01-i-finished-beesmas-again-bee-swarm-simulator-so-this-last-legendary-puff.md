{% raw %}So this last Legendary Puff literally took me a week to find and I had some horrendous lag to deal with, but we did it. A few random players from discord and we made the magic happen. But we almost gave up, as the puffs before this one literally wouldn't turn legendary or did in the last few seconds.<br />Hopefully, Onett just makes these puffs easier really soon because it's just too hard to complete with a laggy game.{% endraw %}
