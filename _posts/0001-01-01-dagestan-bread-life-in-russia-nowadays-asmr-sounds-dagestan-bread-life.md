{% raw %}Dagestan Bread. Life in Russia nowadays. ASMR sounds<br /><br />We visited remote old village in mountains in Dagestan. There people still lead the old way of life, cooking traditional food, doing handicrafts and celebrating events like hundreds of years ago.<br /><br />We are interested in learning how our ancestors lived, to study their traditions and to master ancient crafts and meals.<br /><br />We travel to different regions of Russia and show you how people live in Russian remote villages. Real Village, not embellished real life as it is. We will show you the usual village life and cuisine of different nations.<br /><br />We are the ULENGOVS - Tatiana and Maxim. Welcome to our channel!<br /><br />Many of you have noticed that the sounds (asmr) from our videos are very relaxing, help you fall asleep from insomnia and calm your mind. We are glad to be of service to you.<br /><br />☀ INSTAGRAM -  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tatiana_ulengova/">https://www.instagram.com/tatiana_ulengova/</a><br /><br />Life in the oldest Dagestan Village.
