{% raw %}Contraception,<br />(Stops) impregnation,<br />Condoms are barriers of rubber or plastic,<br />For both males and females condoms work fantastic!<br />Ejaculate,<br />Is caught by it,<br />Within the tip,<br />The sperm now sit!<br />So it efficiently,<br />Stops pregnancy!<br />Next up are the intrauterine devices or IUDs!<br />These come in copper as well as hormonal varieties!<br />These T-shaped devices,<br />Go in the uterus,<br />Placed inside of the uterus,<br />Next, diaphragms are small,<br />Shallow discs y’all!<br />They cover the cervix, okay?<br />And act as barriers to keep sperm at bay!<br />Then there’s the pill, swallowed at will,<br />Don’t ovulate, no baby great!<br />The pill mimics hormones so,<br />Ovulation does not occur, yo!<br />And it makes the uterus,<br />Harsher for sperm due to thick mucus! YES!!!<br />Next vaginal rings, hey!<br />Inside the vagina we stay!<br />From there we release hormones, yay!<br />So ovulation? Not today!<br />Next, fertility awareness,<br />With care and caution, has success!<br />But travel, stress,<br />Or an illness,<br />Can stop success,<br />And cause a mess!<br />Next, a lasting solution!<br />Permanent contraception!<br />Rest at ease, some surgeries,<br />Exist like these! They are near guarantees!<br />Tubal ligation or getting your tubes tied,<br />Is for women, once they decide,<br />They never want to have children!<br />But what about options for men?<br />Well, the male surgical equivalent is a vasectomy,<br />Once the vas deferens is cut, sperm cannot join the semen, see?<br />Contraception!<br />(Stops) Impregnation!<br /><br />Visuals, Lyrics, Audio copyright of Neural Academy<br />Music from Beethoven Symphony #5<br />Mucus VFX asset from Videocopilot{% endraw %}
