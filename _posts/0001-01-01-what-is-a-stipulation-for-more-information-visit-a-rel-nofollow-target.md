In one sense, it refers to a restriction or condition which is attached to an agreement, with the understanding that failure to meet the condition could be grounds for terminating or refusing to enter the agreement. In another sense, it refers to a mutually agreed-upon decision on the part of rival attorneys in a case, in which the attorneys agree to settle a point of order or fact out of court to save time.{% endraw %}
