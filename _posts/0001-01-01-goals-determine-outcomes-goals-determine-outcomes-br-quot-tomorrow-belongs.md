{% raw %}GOALS DETERMINE OUTCOMES <br />&quot;Tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today.&quot;<br />#titusunlimited <br /><br />Goals reflect what impacts you hope to achieve in the futureâ€”they provide the vision of the work you are doing and state what is to be accomplished. Goals are broad statements that often have multiple strategies associated with achieving them.<br />Clear goals and outcomes will help you select the most appropriate techniques or processes that have been identified through research and/or consensus among experts to be the most effective (sometimes called &quot;best practices&quot;). They will also help you specify how you will determine whether you are making progress.<br /><br />Desired outcomes make goals more concrete, so that by changing these outcomes, you get closer to the goal that you set.<br /><br />The goals that you identify should be justified by the priority needs that you identified as a result of your work.<br /><br />&quot;SMART&quot; can help you remember that a desired outcome should be:<br /><br />Specific, describing what will change (e.g., knowledge, skills, attitudes, behaviors), and for whom (e.g., mothers, children)<br /><br />Measurable, focusing on how much change is expected<br /><br />Achievable within a given time frame<br /><br />Realistic, accurately addressing the scope of the problem<br /><br />Time-phased, indicating when the outcome will be measured.<br /><br />#goals #believeinyourself #motivation #inspiration #success #positivethinking #mindset #mindsetiseverything #hardwork #wordstoliveby{% endraw %}
