{% raw %}BLIMEY. This one took a while! Believe it or not I started working on Art of Darkness not long after I completed my first Bendy and the Ink Machine song, Find the Keys! But when the channel took off I realised that I should prioritise making more regular content over one big video so I've spent the past year working on this one bit by bit between other videos. I'm so glad to finally be able to share it with you guys!<br /><br />Given how long it took to make, it went through many changes. It started as a Chapter 3 song but as time went by it ended up including parts of Chapter 4 and 5 too!<br /><br />A huge amount of work went into this one (over 1000 drawings!) so I want to thank everyone who helped and supported me along the way! All of the drawings, animation, lyrics and voices are my own. But if you find a spelling mistake, my girlfriend did the spell checking. ;)<br /><br />If you enjoyed the video, please do share! This is a super special project for me and I'd love for everyone to get a chance to see it!<br /><br />So as I now finally get to work on my next song, I hope in the mean time...
