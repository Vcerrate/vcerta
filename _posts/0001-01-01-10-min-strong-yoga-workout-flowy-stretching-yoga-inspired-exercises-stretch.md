{% raw %}Stretch, slow down &amp; tone your body the relaxed kind of way ♥︎ for mind, body and soul! / Werbung <br /><br />This routine is a mix of:  <br />▸ flowy stretching - in the beginning and end of the video <br />▸ a yoga-inspired way of training - we have 2 „flows“ of 2min each, that are a combo of different yoga, strength  &amp; stretching poses. By combining them, it’s almost like a workout :)  <br /><br />You may also use this to:<br />1. Add a SLOW WORKOUT DAY to your hardcore week. I always have one Pilates / Yoga / Slow Strength Day, usually on the weekend :)<br />2. RELAX after a long day or an intense workout<br />3. PREVENT stiffness, ease sore muscles and keep your body flexible<br />4. WAKE UP in the morning, to start your day right and enjoy some me-time :)<br />5. SMOOTHEN your stiff body after sitting a lot behind your laptop!  <br /><br />__<br /><br />▸ You can find all songs in my Relaxing Playlist.
