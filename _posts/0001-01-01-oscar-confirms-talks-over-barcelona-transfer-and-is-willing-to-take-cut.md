So maybe, but Barca is facing a difficult time now.”<br /><br /><br />“I suppose Barca would also appreciate it as I’m now more experienced, mature and I know they have a lot of youngsters right now. It could work out for everybody. I’d be happy if things work out, but I still have a contract. Shanghai helps me a lot so I have no complaints.”<br /><br />Would Oscar take a pay cut?<br /><br />While Oscar would be happy to join the ranks at Camp Nou and play his part in a rebuilding project overseen by Barca legend Xavi, money may prove a stumbling block.<br /><br />The South American is said to be earning £540,000-a-week in China and concedes he would have to take a salary cut.<br /><br />He added: “I’m aware I’d maybe need to forego something to make it happen.<br /><br />“There’s a break in China football now, so perhaps a loan where I could be paid less like Dani - I’ve heard he’s paid the minimum wage - so maybe I could help out for six months or so, I’m not sure for how long they’d want me.<br /><br />“There are ongoing talks, they have to sort out the club, the competition and reach a decision. Of course one would let go of something to join a club such as Barcelona, but we have to wait for things to sort themselves out before I can decide anything.”<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />#sportscafe<br />#sportscafeMalayalam<br />#footballNeWs<br />#footballmalayalam<br />#footballmalappuram<br />#footballmalayalamstatus<br />#trollfootballmalayalam<br />#trollfootballmalappuram<br />#keralablasters<br />#keralablastersfc<br />#keralablastersofficial<br />#vamosargentina<br />#argentinafanskerala<br />#messifans<br />#brazil_fans_kerala<br />#brazilfanskerala<br />#SportsCafeMalayalam<br />#ManchesterUnited<br />#chelsea<br />#BrazilNataionalFootballTeam<br />#ArgentinaNataionalFootballTeam<br />#PortugalNataionalFootballTeam<br />#CristianoRonaldo<br />#Neymar<br />#LeonelMessi<br />#KylianMbappé<br />#MessiandRonaldo<br />#NeymarandMessi<br />#Chelsea<br />#NewCastleUninted<br />#Liverpool<br />#FCBarcelona<br />#Juventus<br />#Psg<br />#RealMadrid<br />#Suarez<br />#MohammedSalah<br />#SergioRamos<br />#XaviHernandez<br /><br /><br />Xavi Hernandez<br />Xavi Hernandez Barcelona Coach<br />Xavi Hernandez Malayalam News<br />Xavi Hernandez News<br />Cristiano Ronaldo Malayalam<br />Mesut Ozil Malayalam<br />Cristiano Ronaldo Story Malayalam<br />Ronaldo Malayalam<br />Realmadrid Story Malayalam<br />Ozil in Arsenal Malayalam<br />Santiago Bernabeu Malayalam<br />Ronaldo in Manchester United<br />CR7 story malayalam<br />Ronaldo in Real Madrid<br />Ricardo Kaka Story Malayalam<br />Kaka in Real Madrid<br />Kaka realmadrid Malayalam<br />Kaka Brazil Football Player Malayalam<br />Kaka AC Milan<br />Florentino Perez Malayalam<br />Perez Real Madrid<br />Mesut Ozil in Arsenal<br />Mesute Ozil Arsene Wenger<br />Arsene Wenger Story Malayalam.<br />Arsene Wenger Arsenal<br />Manchester United Malayalam<br />Arsenal Story Malayalam<br />Thierry Henry Story Malayalam<br />Theory Henry story malayalam<br />Real Madrid Galactico's Story Malayalam<br />Gunners Arsenal<br />Cristiano Ronaldo Malaylam<br />Cristiano Ronaldo Manchester United<br />Cristiano Ronaldo to Manchester United<br />Cristiano Ronaldo Transfer<br />Alex Ferguson Malayalam<br />Ronaldo Ferguson Malayalam<br />Manchester United Alex Ferguson<br />Arsenal Football Team 2003-2004 Malayalam<br />Arsenal The Invincibles Story malayalam<br />Wenger Invincibles Story Malayalam<br />Aubameyang Life Story<br />Football Malayalam<br />Wenger Henry Malayalam<br />Henry footballer Malayalam<br />Mikel Arteta Arsenal Malayalam<br />Henry football tricks Malayalam<br />CR7 story malayalam<br />Bruno Fernandes Malayalam<br />Paul Pogba Malayalam<br />Pogba Manchester Untied<br />Brazilian Footballer Malayalam<br />Chelsea Malayalam<br />Realmadrid Malayalam<br />Messi Malayalam News<br />Messi Goal Records<br />Messi Family news<br />Neymar Malayalam News<br />Neymar Goal Records<br />Argentina National Football Team News<br />Brazil  National Football Team News<br />Portugal  National Football Team News<br />Argentina Brazil Football News<br />Messi Vs Ronaldo News<br />Messi Ronaldo Statitics<br />Messi Ronaldo Stats<br />Kerala Blasters News<br />Kerala Blasters LineUp<br />Kerala Blasters Foreign Players<br />Kerala Blasters Tactics<br />Kerala Blasters Manjappada<br />Manjappada Kerala Blasters{% endraw %}
