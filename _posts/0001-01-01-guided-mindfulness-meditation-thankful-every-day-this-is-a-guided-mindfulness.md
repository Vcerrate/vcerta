{% raw %}This is a guided mindfulness meditation on being thankful every day. Let the music and my voice calm your anxiety and get you into the right headspace to free your mind on a daily basis. Waking up each morning with a thankful heart can remind us that each day is filled with purpose and possibility. It can lift us up and put a sense of love into our heart, mind, and spirit. Peace to you! üßò<br /><br />I strive to create the most calming and relaxing online guided meditations on YouTube. Some of the most popular topics are better sleep, morning sessions, and healing anxiety.
