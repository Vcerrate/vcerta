We trained well and want to join one of your vids. Francisco had a team of the try guys, Unspeakable and the Royalty Family all were playing red light green when Labrand Fam and the ACE family came and tipped the doll. Then we sat down and ate some food with Shane Dawson, Rebecca Zamolo and Ranz kyle. I didn't like the food it made us fart then Niana Gurrero and Preston showed up and made a joke about us. We all decided to play a Marble game and half of them got eliminated from the squid game. Nelk, Dobre brothers, dobre twins and Lucas and Marcus all came to pick up the losers along with Liza Koshy, Jianhao tan and Corpse Husband. Then came the honeycomb challenge where Dangie Bros, Daniel Gizmo, Carter sharer and Neto Briana decided to help us make the candy. They got burnt but Felipe Neto Brianna and David Dobrik thought it tasted delicious. Lilypichy Valkyrea A4 Tinakitten, Tinakitten came and played tug of war with us. XQCOW, Wilbursoot, Sykkuno and Pokimane thought they were experts at tug of war but when SSSniperWolf and Tommyinnit showed up, they had no chance of winning. After losing, Dhar Mann Adin Ross and Niki HolaSOyGerman/JeugaGerman laughed it out when it was time to start the tile challenge. James Charles, PewDiePie and  Mrbeast all announced the winners of the game and gave them one million dollars.{% endraw %}
