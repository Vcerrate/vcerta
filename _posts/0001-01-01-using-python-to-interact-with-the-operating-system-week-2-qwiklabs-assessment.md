{% raw %}Using Python to Interact with the Operating System WEEK 2 Qwiklabs Assessment Coursera | by Google<br /><br />Welcome to Using Python to Interact with the Operating System! You‚Äôre joining thousands of learners currently enrolled in the course. I'm excited to have you on my channel and look forward to your contributions to the learning community.<br />By the end of this course, you‚Äôll be able to manipulate files and processes on your computer‚Äôs operating system. You‚Äôll also have learned about regular expressions -- a very powerful tool for processing text files -- and you‚Äôll get practice using the Linux command line on a virtual machine. And, this might feel like a stretch right now, but you‚Äôll also write a program that processes a bunch of errors in an actual log file and then generates a summary file. That‚Äôs a super useful skill for IT Specialists to know.<br />Skills you will learn:---<br />* Setting up your Development Environment<br />* Regular Expression (REGEX)<br />* Testing in Python<br />* Automating System Administration Tasks with Python<br />* Bash Scripting<br /><br />‚≠ê Kite is a free AI-powered coding assistant that will help you code faster and smarter.
