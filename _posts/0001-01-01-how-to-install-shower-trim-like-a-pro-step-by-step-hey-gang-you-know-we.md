{% raw %}Hey Gang! You know.. we've had our channel for almost 3 years and we've done so many showers, but never shown how to install a shower trim kit from start to finish! When you open a box of parts from Delta, Kohler or Moen, it looks daunting but hopefully with this video you'll be able to follow along step by step and install the shower trim and make it look quality and professional. Most shower kits are very similar so this should cover a lot of bases! If not, feel free to drop a question down below and we'll get to it as fast as possible! Thanks for watching and we'll see ya in the next one!<br /><br />www.studpack.com<br /><br />contact: studpack225@gmail.com{% endraw %}
