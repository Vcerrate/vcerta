We spent a few thousand on pairs we unboxed today. We bought a giant pack of the Nike Dunk Low White/Black or Pandas and more rare shoes. This is a cash out we would normally do at a sneaker event / show. We were able to get some great deals on these shoes, for us to make a good profit on. This really is what goes on in a day in the life of a sneaker business. We also share some sneaker reselling advice. We show you many sneaker unboxings in this video, which also feel like sneaker mystery boxes to us sometimes. We are starting a twitch stream, so make sure to go follow us on that platform! We also share that we will be at Sneaker Con Fort Lauderdale 2022 in January. Based on how Sneakercon Denver, Sneakercon Dallas, Sneakercon Chicago, Sneaker con San Jose / Bay Area, Sneakercon Atlanta, Boston Got Sole, New York / New Jersey Got Sole, Sneaker con Phoenix, and Kobey's Swap Meet went, Sneaker Events in 2022 like Sneakercon Fort Lauderdale, Florida (Miami) and Vancouver, Canada will be BANGERS. We hope you all enjoy the videos and thank you for the continued support!<br /><br />If you guys are in the Phoenix, Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Tempe or Scottsdale area in Arizona, come check out our shop located in Tempe!<br /><br />Help me hit 20K followers on Instagram<br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thecommonhype/">https://www.instagram.com/thecommonhype/</a><br />Store IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/commonhypeaz/">https://www.instagram.com/commonhypeaz/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/thecommonhype">https://twitter.com/thecommonhype</a><br />Cook Group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thegoodchefs/">https://www.instagram.com/thegoodchefs/</a><br /><br />â™ª Onion (Prod. by Lukrembo)<br />Link : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/KGQNrzqrGqw">https://youtu.be/KGQNrzqrGqw</a><br /><br />#SneakerUnboxing #MysteryBox #Reseller{% endraw %}
