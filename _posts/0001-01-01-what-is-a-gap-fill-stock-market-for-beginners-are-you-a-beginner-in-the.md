{% raw %}Are you a beginner in the stock market and and confused by the term &quot;gap fill&quot;? When I was a beginner to the stock market and just getting started I remembered many terms out there that I truly had no idea what they meant. That's okay! As a new trader and investor it's perfectly normal for you to not understand some of the trading and investing terminology that exists. The good news is that when it comes to &quot;gap fills&quot;, the answer is very straight forward. The first step I will show you is what a &quot;gap&quot; is when it occurs with a stock, and then from that point it becomes very easy to learn about what a &quot;gap fill&quot; actually is. If you are someone who is a beginner to the stock market and wants a quick explanation of some common investment terminology, then look no further.
