{% raw %}Great 4k footage taken from NASA for you to sit back and enjoy the beauty of our Sun for 10 hours in 4K. Accompanied by a soothing Space Wind audio. Perfect for looping to relax, meditate, sleep, yoga, pilates, live wallpaper, dinner parties or just reading a book with as a nice window to look out of on your monitor or television. <br />NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory created these images of our sun in ten wavelengths of invisible ultraviolet light. Truly Amazing. <br /><br />Please Subscribe and check out our other videos for other great nature windows to relax to. <br /><br />Great minds come from great nature.<br /><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/relaxationwindows/">https://www.facebook.com/relaxationwindows/</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/RelaxWindows">https://twitter.com/RelaxWindows</a>{% endraw %}
