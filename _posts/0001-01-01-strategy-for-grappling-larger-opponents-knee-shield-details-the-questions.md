{% raw %}The questions I get more than any other are nearly always regarding how to deal with bigger, stronger opponents…and it’s kind of a weird question, because I always try to use things that work on everyone. The main answer is you have to be more precise with your technique when dealing with bigger people because there’s less room for mistakes and more severe punishment for flawed technique. <br /><br />However, if I had to address the technical aspect of dealing with bigger opponents, I would say that understanding frames is one of the most crucial things. So in this video, I show one of the best positions to illustrate strong and active framing, which is the knee shield position. I hope this helps. <br /><br />X-Martial rash guard and shorts I’m wearing in this video available here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.xmartial.com/?ref=KNIGHTJIUJITSU">https://www.xmartial.com/?ref=KNIGHTJIUJITSU</a> <br /><br />Hundreds more class instruction videos at Patreon.com/KnightJiuJitsu, BJJ Fanatics &amp; Jiu-Jitsu X.<br /><br />Please be sure to turn on notifications for new videos if you haven’t, so you can find out as soon as I upload a new one each week. <br /><br />Become a member of this channel for exclusive class videos not available for free.
