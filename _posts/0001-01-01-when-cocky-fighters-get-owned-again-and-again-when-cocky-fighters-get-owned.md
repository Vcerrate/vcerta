{% raw %}When Cocky Fighters Get Owned Again And Again<br /><br />Fighters like to touch their gloves before the match starts to not disrespectful incase they getting knocked out. It is considered a traditional way of giving sportsmanship, honor and respect to the opponent in the ring. We can call it a handshake done while wearing gloves.<br /><br />Here, you will be surprised to know there are two types of fighters. One, those who touch the gloves before the fight in front of the match referee. Here, the referee asks them to touch their gloves if they are interested in doing so. This tradition is very common in fights.<br /><br />While other fighters love to touch their gloves during the match, once it is started. It looks more value-added before than the first glove touch because here is no referee giving fighters the instructions and asking them to touch their gloves. So, it looks like the genuine way of giving respect and honor from a fighter to his opponent. <br /><br />Once the fighters have touched the gloves during a fight, they get again into the match. <br /><br />In today’s video, you will be looking at 10 fighters who didn’t have to wait too long to regret not showing respect for their opponent by touching gloves before the fight started.<br /><br />You are going to see some that just didn’t do it at the face-off to others that used it as a weapon by faking the glove touch to catch their opponent off balance but in the end, they all failed. They ended up looking pretty dumb.{% endraw %}
