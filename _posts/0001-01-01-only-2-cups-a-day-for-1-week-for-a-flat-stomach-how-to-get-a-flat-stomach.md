Taken before a meal, it has a stimulating effect on metabolism and digestion. <br />- If your level of cortisol (the hormone which reacts to the level of stress you are under) is elevated, it can lead to accumulation of belly fat. It turns out that it is very hard to get rid of the fat that appeared due to this reason. <br />-  If you lack the energy to do regular exercises, ginger will help you out! It has an effect that is similar to that of caffeine.
