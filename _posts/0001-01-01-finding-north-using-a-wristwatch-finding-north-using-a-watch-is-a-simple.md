{% raw %}Finding North using a watch is a simple skill everyone needs to know. You can use a traditional watch to approximate a desired direction of travel. Here are the steps. Hold the watch horizontal. Point the hour hand in the direction of the sun. Bisect the angle between the hour hand and the 12 o'clock position. If navigating during daylight savings time, substitute the twelve for the 1 o'clock. This will only work in the northern hemisphere. If in the southern hemisphere point the 12 o'clock position at the sun and reverse order. <br />Follow Wranglerstar on Facebook for exclusive videos, pictures, &amp; updates. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Wranglerstar/453208754723615">http://www.facebook.com/pages/Wranglerstar/453208754723615</a>{% endraw %}
