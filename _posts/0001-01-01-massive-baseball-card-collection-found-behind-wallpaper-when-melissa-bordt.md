{% raw %}When Melissa Bordt purchased a fixer upper house in Boise, Idaho, for $324,000, she knew she had a lot of work to do. Renovations started immediately, and no room needed more work than a bedroom with an ugly green wall with faux tiles. The more she peeled, the more she revealed. Hidden behind the wall, she discovered a giant collection of baseball cards. There were a whopping 1,600 cards in total. According to memorabilia appraiser Leila Dunbar, the collection is unfortunately of little value.{% endraw %}
