{% raw %}USEFUL THINGS YOU CAN TRY IN YOUR FREE TIME<br /><br /><br /><br />In this video, I show you how to make your own entertaining things that will help you pass the time.  <br /><br />Mix some gouache paint in a few ice-cubes and cover them with water. After that, add some toothpicks or popsicle sticks in the tray to hold them when you’re painting. Let them freeze and voila. <br /><br />You can also pour some melted chocolate in your ice-trays, add some berries, or nits and then let it cool down. After that, sprinkle some nuts on top and serve to your friends.  <br /><br />Another great use for ice-trays is to make candles. Grate some crayons in your tray, add some melted candle base, and some candle wicks in each compartment and let them dry. <br /><br />I also show you how to give some color to your phone using polymer clay. You can make it look like a cupcake with little candy decorations on top or like noodles with mini egg and seasoning decorations. <br /><br /><br /><br />Timestamps: <br /><br />0:07 – Amazing tricks with trays<br /><br />1:01 – Brilliant epoxy resin crafts<br /><br />2:56 – Brilliant hacks using a 3D pen<br /><br />4:05 – DIY anti-stress case<br /><br />6:23 – Painting tutorials<br /><br />8:56 – CD vs paint<br /><br />11:05 – Cute car tire painting<br /><br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
