{% raw %}Today we leave Pattaya and head to Southern Thailand.  Our first major destination will be Phuket, but we will stop and have some fun along the way.  Our first evening finds us in the small beach town of Cha Am where we have a look around the beach at sunset and enjoy a meal.  The next morning we load back up and head for Hua Hin.  Enjoy the Ride!<br /><br />#Pattaya #Phuket #Rides4Kickz #Thailand{% endraw %}
