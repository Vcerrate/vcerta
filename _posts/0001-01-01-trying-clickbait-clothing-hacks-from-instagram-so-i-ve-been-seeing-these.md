{% raw %}So I've been seeing these clothing and fashion hack videos all over Instagram, and they always seem so incredibly strange that I decided to test a bunch of them out and see how they were! We tried a few out from different instagram accounts and pages and ended up with a boxer bralette, a laminated shirt, a skirt weighed down with coins, a bra strap necklace, and napkin shoes!<br /><br />Don't forget to cast your tattoo vote at the end of the video before Tuesday afternoon!<br /><br />BTW, if you don't see the &quot;i&quot; icon in the corner to vote on the tattoo, try hovering or clicking on the screen to see it in the corner!<br /><br />Donâ€™t forget to click the bell to turn on post notifications!<br /><br />Safiya's Nextbeat: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nextbeat.co/u/safiya">https://nextbeat.co/u/safiya</a><br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/">https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/safiyajn">https://twitter.com/safiyajn</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/">https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/</a><br /><br />Assistant Editors: Claire Wiley &amp; Emily Linden<br /><br />MUSIC<br />Mind The Gap<br />Risky Move<br />Peanut Man<br />Close Embrace<br />Roma Trompeta<br />Tommys Tango<br />via Audio Network<br /><br />SFX<br />via AudioBlocks{% endraw %}
