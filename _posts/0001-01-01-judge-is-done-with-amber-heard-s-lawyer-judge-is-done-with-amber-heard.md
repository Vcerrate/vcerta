{% raw %}Judge Is DONE With Amber Heardâ€™s Lawyer!<br /><br />Amber Heardâ€™s team can be quite a handful during this defamation trial and the judge is getting EXHAUSTED because of them. This isnâ€™t helping the team at all! You have to be on the judgeâ€™s good side all the time if you want to win the trial after all...<br /><br />Majority of the time, both lawyers would be called to the stand because Amberâ€™s lawyers would spew nonsense and Johnnyâ€™s lawyers would object in return. This is getting tiring for the judge! Sheâ€™s probably glad theyâ€™re on break right now. <br /><br />Here on Film Streak we are all about the latest spill in Hollywood!
