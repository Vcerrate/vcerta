{% raw %}Our largest inner core muscle called the transverse abdominis is our main focus.  This supports our internal organs, pelvic floor muscles, lower back, and adds to good posture.  This large deep abdominal muscle is often over-looked and is the key muscle to giving you a flat stomach.  This exercise can be done at any place and any time.  All you need is a chair.    <br /><br />Please subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc">https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc</a><br /><br />Kindly share this video on your social media so we can help educate others.
