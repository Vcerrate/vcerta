{% raw %}This is a 15 minute Vinyasa flow yoga class to help build strength and flexibility throughout the whole body.<br />If you arent familiar with Vinyasa flow yoga it is a style of yoga where we sync breath with movement creating a natural heat within the body that helps release toxins and increase flexibility. Vinyasa can be more challenging for some which is a great way to build strength within the arms, core and legs. This practice is a great way to also connect with the body, breathing more and being aware of the breath and any sensations within the body.<br />During this yoga class we will work through a fun flow mixed with hip openers, heart openers and strengthening postures like chair pose and chaturanga.<br />See you on the mat!<br /><br />***DONATE***<br />By donating to the Yoga With Bird YouTube channel you are helping in creating new content &amp; keeping yoga free and accessible to all. <br />Grateful for your generosity <br />-Bird<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/yogawithbird">https://www.paypal.me/yogawithbird</a><br /><br />Yoga With Bird's Email List:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mailchi.mp/34e952e0ed28/yoga-with-bird-email-list">https://mailchi.mp/34e952e0ed28/yoga-with-bird-email-list</a><br /><br />Get Your FREE Monthly Calendar!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.yogawithbird.com/calendars/">http://www.yogawithbird.com/calendars/</a><br /><br />Outfit:<br />Get $20 off <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://rwrd.io/8v1aaao">http://rwrd.io/8v1aaao</a><br /><br />Yoga Essentials:<br />Yoga Mat: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/31wXrLM">https://amzn.to/31wXrLM</a><br />Yoga Blocks: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3krpftG">https://amzn.to/3krpftG</a><br />Yoga Strap: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2DLEhcQ">https://amzn.to/2DLEhcQ</a><br />Pranamat: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/31z0aEj">https://amzn.to/31z0aEj</a><br /><br />Self Care Favorites:<br />Epsom Salt: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ik0L3u">https://amzn.to/3ik0L3u</a><br />Natural Vegan Skin Care: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/33Hqu1B">https://amzn.to/33Hqu1B</a><br />Vegan Body Lotion: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3kr4IW1">https://amzn.to/3kr4IW1</a><br />Vegan Parfume: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/31z0QJR">https://amzn.to/31z0QJR</a><br /><br />Music Used:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/qnrd89/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/qnrd89/</a><br /><br />Join Honey to SAVE money while shopping online:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.joinhoney.com/ref/45p0vps">https://www.joinhoney.com/ref/45p0vps</a><br /><br />Yoga Challenges:<br />30 Day Yoga For Inflexible People: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlybJmrSb19MiVWnve5slKTJ">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlybJmrSb19MiVWnve5slKTJ</a><br />30 Day Yoga For Relaxation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlwr-X3VF2CrZdf7rDrWH1aB">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlwr-X3VF2CrZdf7rDrWH1aB</a><br />7 Day Yoga For Overall Health: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlyTB8gu7I99XQkw9M85YdTk">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlyTB8gu7I99XQkw9M85YdTk</a><br />5 Day Yoga For Mornings: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlyjr87XsR6j4QGzyKKxwsTH">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlyjr87XsR6j4QGzyKKxwsTH</a><br />5 Day Yoga For Hips: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlwAnZvLflZM-e5WWedHTBpo">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlwAnZvLflZM-e5WWedHTBpo</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: <br />Some links may be affiliate links that Yoga With Bird earns a small percentage of how ever each affiliate product is something she genuinely loves and has used herself.
