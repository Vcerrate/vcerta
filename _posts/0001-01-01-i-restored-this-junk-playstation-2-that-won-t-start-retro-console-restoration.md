{% raw %}I will restore this PlayStation 2 which won't start. PS2 is the best selling gaming console ever made, only the GameBoy (all models included) has sold more units.<br /><br />Here's the T-shirt rest of my links are at the bottom of description: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://odd-tinkering-2.creator-spring.com/listing/new-gamestation-blueprints?product=387">https://odd-tinkering-2.creator-spring.com/listing/new-gamestation-blueprints?product=387</a><br /><br />When I tested the console I noticed it had the red power light on but when I tried to start the console it would only briefly flash green and nothing would happen. The red light indicated there's some power and often the flashing green light indicated ssomething wrong with the power board. After opening the console I quickly found several dead capacitors. They were easy to recognize since the top was bulged and there were clear signs of leaking. Luckily the leaked acid had not damaged the board further. I replced the capacitors with new ones. I also cleaned the boards from dust and with isopropyl alcohol.The original model sticker was in bad condition so I copied it in photoshop and printed a new one.<br /><br />In case you're courious, the building I show in the end is located in Finland and is known as &quot;Raaden Hammas&quot; it means the tooth of Raade after former CEO of the company that originally built it. Funnily located it's right next to local Microsoft office. And most importantly it was built way before Playstation 2 was released.<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />The bellow links to amazon are affiliate link. I get a small fee of anything you buy after clicking them, but you pay no more than without clicking. This is a great way to support my channel.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />Check out my Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/odd.tinkering/">https://www.instagram.com/odd.tinkering/</a> <br />T-Shirts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/odd-tinkering-2">https://teespring.com/stores/odd-tinkering-2</a><br />Support me on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/oddtinkering">https://www.patreon.com/oddtinkering</a> <br /><br />SOME TOOLS FROM THIS PROJECT: <br />Screw driver set: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2P0AmMp">https://amzn.to/2P0AmMp</a> <br />Soldering iron <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3h2LkNz">https://amzn.to/3h2LkNz</a><br />Vacuum cleaner: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ilcAZm">https://amzn.to/3ilcAZm</a><br />Black gloves: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/363OsrL">https://amzn.to/363OsrL</a><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />SUBSCRIBE ▶▶▶ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_s...">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_s...</a> <br />--------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />Restoration playlist▶ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVIxIjRNxFv5VRUXt66VzBxOys1GpmBp4">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVIxIjRNxFv5VRUXt66VzBxOys1GpmBp4</a> <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />#restoration<br />#repair<br />#gaming<br />#asmr<br />#playstation{% endraw %}
