{% raw %}In light of the recent controversy with the leaked Disney &quot;woke agenda&quot; video and the House Bill 1557 that was passed in Florida, we discuss whether there is a dark, evil agenda to indoctrinate children and perhaps even normalize child grooming.<br /><br />Moreover, we take a look at the ongoing Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith debacle, and how it all relates to the deceptive woke culture narrative. <br /><br />#WhensdayWarmUp #Disney #WillSmith<br /><br />Resources:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzPylqS01qU&amp;t=224s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzPylqS01qU&amp;t=224s</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCpNoWBb5X4&amp;t=195s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCpNoWBb5X4&amp;t=195s</a> <br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />The views, information, or opinions expressed during any of The Insights Show video-podcast series (on any of the shows under The Insights Show banner) are solely those of the individuals involved and do not necessarily represent those of The Insights Show and its employees (including its hosts).
