{% raw %}'Use' and 'Usage' are two words that overlap somewhat, but are not entirely synonymous. Such words leave people confused sometimes. 'Use' can be a noun or a verb, while the word &quot;usage&quot; is always a noun. In simple words it can be said that &quot;use&quot; is most commonly used to signify the act of using, whereas the word &quot;usage&quot; is used when we want to refer to a practice or habitual use of something. Listen to the conversations carefully and understand how the vocabulary is used. Practice at the end to build your fluency and comprehension.<br /><br />Looking forward to new lessons?
