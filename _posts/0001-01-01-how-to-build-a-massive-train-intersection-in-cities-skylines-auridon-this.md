{% raw %}This episode focuses on how to set up your train network to avoid train traffic with a massive train network overhaul, splitting cargo and intercity passenger lines, and keeping internal train lines separate, whilst building a double Y train interchange one on top of the other!  We also build and detail a new local train station complete with nearby hypermarket, and overview all of our mass transit services to ensure they are working efficiently.<br /><br />Welcome to Auridon! This is a 'lightly’ modded Cities Skylines gameplay series, although I do use a ton of mods the series will use mostly Vanilla (+DLC) building assets with only a handful of extras from the workshop.  The focus of this build is on making a detailed city, with functional mass transit, including all DLC and content creator packs. 2022 ready!  The series is based on game play mixed in with detailing timelapse's. <br /><br />▶ SUPPORT ME:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/fewcandy">https://www.patreon.com/fewcandy</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instant-gaming.com/?igr=FewCandy">https://www.instant-gaming.com/?igr=FewCandy</a><br /><br />▶ AURIDON PLAYLIST:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOM4arexyrFmeabWVsJMYNsX25rTNMVTT">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOM4arexyrFmeabWVsJMYNsX25rTNMVTT</a><br /><br />▶ ** E6GSY's MAPS **<br />Go and check out the map, Taka Toolo, by E6GSY here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2438770348">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2438770348</a><br />And check out his other maps here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2224226836">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2224226836</a><br /><br />▶ SOCIALS:<br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/mtfCQm7DvH">https://discord.gg/mtfCQm7DvH</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/fewcandyuk/">https://www.instagram.com/fewcandyuk/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/fewcandyuk">https://twitter.com/fewcandyuk</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/fewcandy">https://www.twitch.tv/fewcandy</a><br /><br />▶ MY PC SPECS:<br />- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X<br />- Motherboard: ASUS TUF X570-PLUS GAMING<br />- RAM: Corsair Vengeance 64GB DDR4 (3200 MHz)<br />- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080<br /><br />▶ MODS &amp; ASSETS:<br />Mods collection: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2692149190">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2692149190</a><br />Auridon asset list (updated as much as possible!): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2699398105">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2699398105</a><br /><br />▶ SAVE GAME FILE (from Ep 20):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787919336">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787919336</a><br />YOU WILL NEED TO ALSO DOWNLOAD THE MODS AND ASSETS LISTS!<br /><br />▶ MAP THEME MIX &amp; LUT:<br />Realistic Boreal Theme by Captain Soap<br />Theme mixer used to adjust cliff textures, and using pavements from the Seychelles theme by Ronyx69<br />Cleyra - Color Correction LUT<br /><br />▶ MUSIC:<br />Courtesy of Epidemic Sound www.epidemicsound.com<br />Loving Caliber - Beyond The Horizon (SLCT Remix)<br />Velee - So Am I<br />Plus music from the YouTube music library.<br /><br />▶ CHAPTERS:<br />00:00 Intro<br />04.01 Reworking the internal train network<br />10:47 Detailing the suburban station<br />20:57 Splitting cargo and passenger train networks<br />27:50 Creating a massive train intersection<br />41:56 Overview of Bus, Tram and Monorail networks<br />51:39 Detailing Timelapse<br />57:00 Detailing Overview<br />58:18 Outro &amp; Cinematics<br /><br />I've taken massive inspiration for this build, and to start my channel, from the Cities: Skylines greats such as Biffa, Imperatur and City Planner Plays (among many many others I would add!!) but above all from the amazing OverchargedEgg and in particular his Palaven series which has heavily inspired this city.
