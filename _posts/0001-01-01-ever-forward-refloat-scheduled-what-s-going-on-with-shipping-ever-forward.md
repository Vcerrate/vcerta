{% raw %}Ever Forward Refloat Scheduled<br /><br />What's Going on With Shipping? <br />March 27, 2022 <br /><br />On this episode, Sal Mercogliano - former merchant mariner and maritime historian - discusses the March 27, 2022 Marine Safety Information Bulletin from US Coast Guard Sector Maryland on the two planned efforts to refloat MV Ever Forward, which grounded departing Baltimore on March 13, on route to Norfolk, Virginia.  We also discuss options for the second attempt, including additional dredging and potential other assets that could be deployed to assist in the salvage. <br /><br />***The tweet I read from on the first salvage attempt stated the tugs were pushing and pulling from the wrong sides.  As per the diagram, they will push on the port side and pull from the starboard quarter.***<br /><br />MSIB 10-22 (UPDATE 1) COTP Maryland-NCR Safety Zone - EVER FORWARD Chesapeake Bay MD<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://homeport.uscg.mil/Lists/Content/DispForm.aspx?ID=77062&amp;Source=/Lists/Content/DispForm.aspx?ID=77062">https://homeport.uscg.mil/Lists/Content/DispForm.aspx?ID=77062&amp;Source=/Lists/Content/DispForm.aspx?ID=77062</a>{% endraw %}
