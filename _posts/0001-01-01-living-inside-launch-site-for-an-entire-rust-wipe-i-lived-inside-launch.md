{% raw %}I lived inside launch site for an entire wipe and wasn't allowed to leave! Solo Rust is hard enough at the best of times, let alone when you set restrictions and extra challenges!<br /><br />Make sure to upvote my hatchet skin on Steam!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2780291032">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2780291032</a><br /><br />USE CODE 'YEXOM' TO GET 10% OFF YOUR GAMERSUPPS ORDER! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://gamersupps.gg/?afmc=Yexom">http://gamersupps.gg/?afmc=Yexom</a><br /><br />➤Join the Discord for Weekly Rust Skin Giveaways! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/nEDAs5YDZN">https://discord.gg/nEDAs5YDZN</a><br />➤ Come watch me on Twitch - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/yexom_">https://www.twitch.tv/yexom_</a><br />➤ Follow me on Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Yexom_">https://twitter.com/Yexom_</a><br /><br />For some reason I like to make solo Rust more difficult by setting myself restrictions. For this video, I made it so I can’t leave the area of launch site for the entire wipe. Once I spawned on the beach, I would have to make my way straight to the grids of launch and place down a sleeping bag, from there, I was locked into the area. Launch site being a pretty big monument meant that I had quite a few grids to work with, but that definitely didn’t mean that this was going to be easy.<br /><br />The only aim in Rust is to survive. Everything wants you to die - the island’s wildlife and other inhabitants, the environment, other survivors. Do whatever it takes to last another night.<br /><br />#Rust #SoloRust #LaunchSite{% endraw %}
