{% raw %}On February 18, 2022, AIMS High School held its production of Morningstar. Tomorrow at 6 PM, AIMS will be hosting a watch party on Facebook and YouTube. Thank you for supporting our teachers and students to make the show happen!<br /><br />-<br /><br />Morningstar is a fable about a young aristocratic woman who must travel alone and incognito through her country, in search of her future husband. Along the way, she meets a variety of characters and learns hard lessons about humility, responsibility, and leadership. #AIMSTRONG #AIMSHS{% endraw %}
