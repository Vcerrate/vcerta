I’ll slam the door<br />I don’t know what you were missin’<br />I won’t fuckin listen<br />I’m over yesterday<br /><br />Tell me the things you haven’t admitted to yourself<br />Like you’re lonely, depressed, and suicidal<br />When it’s 2 AM and your mind starts to rattle<br />Do you pick up the blade, or the bottle?<br />They’re the difference between breathing and feeling alive<br />2 AM is someone who will find all the dirt hiding underneath your nails<br />And see every skeleton in your closet<br />And they will still answer the phone every time<br />We’re all the same at 2 AM<br /><br />I’m not okay<br />Don’t know how I’ll get through today<br />I wish that you would come my way, I’d meet you by the shore<br />I kinda wanna change my name<br />Pack a bag and send myself away<br />So I can never be someone for you to just ignore<br />Why don’t you need (fuck)<br />I’m not okay<br />Don’t know how I’ll get through today<br />I wish that you would come my way, I’d meet you by the shore<br />I kinda wanna change my name<br />Pack a bag and send myself away<br />So I can never be someone for you to just ignore<br />Why don’t you need me anymore{% endraw %}
