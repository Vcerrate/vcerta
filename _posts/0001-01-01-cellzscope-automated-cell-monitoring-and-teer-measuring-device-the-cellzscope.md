{% raw %}The cellZscope allows label-free monitoring of barrier forming cells grown in standard cell culture inserts under physiological conditions. The transepithelial electrical resistance TEER and the cell layer capacitance Ccl are automatically recorded over hours, days or even weeks. cellZscope systems are the ideal tools for studying the influence of substances such as drugs or toxins on the barrier function of cell layers.{% endraw %}
