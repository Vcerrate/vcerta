{% raw %}The report highlights T-90 battle tanks, S-400 hypersonic surface to air missile systems and K-300P Bastion coastal defence systems as platforms which Iran is expected to prioritise acquiring - alongside mention of Su-30 air superiority fighters. <br /><br />The report also noted that China could be a major supplier of modern ars to Iran after October, although failing to specify the kind of Chinese hardware Iran was likely to seek out. <br /><br />Iran previously sought to acquire S-300PMU-2 missile systems, MiG-31 heavyweight interceptors and T-72 battle tanks from Russia, and though it failed to acquire any aircraft form post-Soviet Russia it did gain a licence to manufacture several hundred T-72 tanks domestically which currently comprise the mainstay of its armoured units. <br /><br />#S400Missile #IranAirDefense #IranNewWeapons #IranMilitary #IranArmy #IranS400Missile{% endraw %}
