{% raw %}many of you may have questioned why I have slowed down on making videos and its for a collection of reasons like large life changes and spreading myself thin but this without a doubt played a big part in it. I feel like this event should have been no big deal as it is very natural but it was the event that pushed me over the edge. I have been depressed for months and while I embrace moments in my life where i become depressed because i know that i will grow stronger as a person because of it, its also a reason big reason for me to be silent and reflect on life and what is going on around me. A very big part of this channel is the voice over and if I am not in the right mental space just expect me to back away when needed. I feel that is for the greater good. Healing is an ugly process and I don't want to say anything that will create a negative seed in someone else's life. <br /><br />All that said the last few months have been such an awesome thing for me and have allowed me to start breaking out of my BS. I was able to giveaway a brand new mower away in Louisville KY and then spent 2 weeks working (something that I love to do) everyday doing power washing in Arkansas from there I came home and lawns were starting to wake up so I got to cut some grass....something I love to do. lol then I got a call from my friend Al in Florida and he asked me to come down and cut some properties with him so I took the family down to Florida for a week. I knocked out a bunch of work then spent a few day at the beach with my wife and daughter jumping waves in the Ocean. On top of all of that we found out that Rachel is pregnant and we are expecting out second child. We are super excited for our new addition to the family in November. <br /><br />Thank you so much for you kindess, love and support!!<br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br />Juggernaut Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lawn_care_juggernaut/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/lawn_care_juggernaut/?hl=en</a><br />-----------------------------------------------<br />Mailing address for Lawn Care Juggernaut Channel<br />P.O.
