{% raw %}Fatal Attraction<br />Written &amp; Recorded by Left to Suffer<br />Produced by Joshua Travis<br />Mixed by Nathan Northway<br />Mastered by Mike Kalajian<br />Visualizer by Sam Beck<br /><br />LYRICS:<br />All I know is I’m lost I the dark<br />Aggravated in here and you’re the only one who can find me <br />You cut me open and you tell me that I’m not enough <br />You say you love me while you’re pulling out a loaded gun <br /><br />Eviscerate the image in my fucking brain <br />The mental pain of wasting all my days away <br />I have no time left <br />I guess this is as good as it gets <br /><br />I wish I could your whisper lays between the wood <br />And not stuck in my goddamn head <br />Why is the image haunting me in my sleep <br />As if my mental state was a trophy that you could keep <br /><br />I was made to cast that judgment back <br /><br />It’s not as hard as it looks <br />But you try to ruin me <br />And you know you’re not justified <br />When you’re not satisfied <br />With the people that you’ve done wrong <br /><br />I know it’s something that we’re running from <br />How much more of this can I take lately <br /><br />Now we’re standing face to face <br />(We’re standing face to face) <br />I know it’s easy to say when it’s over <br />I scream into these burning lungs <br />And now I’m left with the fatal attraction <br /><br />(But now we’re left with the fatal attraction)<br /><br />Oh god! We’re all made to burn <br />I wish you’d speak my every word <br />You’re no better than the rest <br />You’re a failure, even when you try your best <br /><br />I’m waking up in cold sweats <br />Praying on bated breathe <br />Only begging that you can take everything back <br />But I know that’s just not how it works <br />We fight to feel the pain just to feel something <br />Oh <br /><br />Not a word out of your mouth <br />But you try to ruin me <br />And you know youre not justified for the people that you’ve done wrong <br /><br />(Now we’re standing face to face)<br /><br />Now we’re standing face to face <br />(We’re standing face to face) <br />I know it’s easy to say when it’s over <br />I scream into these burning lungs <br />And now I’m left with the fatal attraction{% endraw %}
