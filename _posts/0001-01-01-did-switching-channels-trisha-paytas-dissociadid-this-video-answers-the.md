We see a disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct personality states (in some cultures these distinct personality states may be referred to as possession), we see a marked discontinuity of self and alterations in affect, behavior, consciousness, memory, perception, cognition, and sensory motor functions. These different personality states may be observed by other individuals and reported to the individual who has this disorder. We also see recurrent gaps in recall of everyday events, personal information, or traumatic events. These gaps in recall can't be attributed to normal forgetfulness. There must be clinically significant distress or impairment and it cannot be a normal part of cultural or religious practices, substance use, or a medical condition. The prevalence of dissociative identity disorder is thought to be between 1 and 1.6% of the general population. We know that this particular disorder is associated with a great deal of comorbidity, meaning it tends to co-occur with other mental disorders like borderline personality disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, somatic symptom disorder, eating disorders, sleep disorders, conversion disorder, and substance use disorder. Also, self-harm behaviors and suicidal behaviors have been associated with dissociative identity disorder. <br /><br />Boysen, G. A., &amp; VanBergen, A. (2014).
