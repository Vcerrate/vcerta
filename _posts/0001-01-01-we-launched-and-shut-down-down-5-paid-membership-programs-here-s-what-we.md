{% raw %}Paid membership programs are often promoted as really good, easy revenue for educators and entertainers alike on YouTube, but after launching 5 different paid memberships and doing everything we knew to do in order to grow it, eventually we ended up shutting every one of them down. Why?<br /><br />We just shut down our most recent paid membership effort, called our Growth Network, after a year and a half of giving it everything we had.<br /><br />But through that experience I think we're getting closer to the thing that's actually going to work.<br /><br />In this episode I share what we tried, what happened, why I think it didn't work, and what we learned from it going forward for our business. Plus, I introduce you to a new platform we're using that's been incredible for our business.<br /><br />CHAPTERS<br />0:00 Introduction<br />1:08 I'm not anti-membership<br />2:29 My first failed membership program<br />5:21 I tried Patreon instead<br />7:55 A math exercise for my time and effort<br />8:44 My most recent membership attempt<br />14:37 Evaluating what I did wrong<br />20:59 What the data is leading me to try instead<br />28:42 The main lessons I learned through all this<br />30:40 Stumbling across something GREAT for us<br />33:29 Discovering Volley as a perfect solution<br />39:53 Trying Volley with our other programs<br />41:26 Volley directly solves our problems<br />42:05 Creators who could benefit from Volley<br />44:03 Get direct access to me in Volley<br />48:07 Conclusion<br /><br />JOIN ME IN VOLLEY!
