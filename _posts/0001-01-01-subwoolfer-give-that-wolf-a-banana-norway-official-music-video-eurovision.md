{% raw %}Subwoolfer will represent Norway at the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 in Turin with the song Give That Wolf A Banana.<br /><br />And just who are @Subwoolfer? Well. Question not the identities of the 2 figures behind Subwoolfer. Question only the dietary merits of the canine consumption of potassium. And while youâ€™re at it, chime in with the eternal question posed within the lyrics of the song: 'is that saliva or blood drippinâ€™ off your chin?'<br /><br />The duo, who call themselves Keith &amp; Jim, claim to come not from some obscure mountainous region in Norway, but rather, the moon. They come in peace, however. Even going so far as to campaign for the protection of grandmothers everywhere from the very real threat of ravenous wolves, having come up with the novel idea of placating them with fruity snacks.<br /><br />Thanks to participating broadcaster @NRK. <br /><br />-<br />The Eurovision Song Contest celebrates diversity through music.
