{% raw %}Really well made level that I'm surprised didn't get epic. I like the boss chase through the whole level and I thought the coins were well placed. CastirX keeps making great levels and I hope keep making more. Well done!<br /><br />Rated: Hard<br />Stars: 5<br /><br />Level ID: 34076930<br />Song: Reapers<br />By: DJVI<br /><br />Don't forget to Subscribe and leave a like!<br /><br />For more replays go to my Everyplay - <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://everyplay.com/zyperion/home">https://everyplay.com/zyperion/home</a>{% endraw %}
