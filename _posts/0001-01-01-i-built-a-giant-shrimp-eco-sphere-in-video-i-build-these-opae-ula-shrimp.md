{% raw %}In video I build these Opae Ula shrimp a giant self-sustaining bowl! This setup requires no filter, no heater and no water changes. Will their long journey from Hawaii to my fish studio in Chicago be worth it? Watch to find out! They're so cute!<br /><br />Make sure you subscribe to see more awesome videos in the new fish studio.<br /><br />I use Wetpets aquariums for all my builds. You can get yours here with $25 off using this link!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wetpets.co/">https://wetpets.co/</a><br /><br />If you have any comments, suggestions or questions, leave them down in the comments!
