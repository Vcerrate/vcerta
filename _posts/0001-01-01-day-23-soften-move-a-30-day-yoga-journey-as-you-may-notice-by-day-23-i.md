{% raw %}As you may notice, by Day 23, I start to have a little more fun in my leadership here.<br />I hope you take it as a great reminder that this is a training designed to improve your quality of life. I find softness in yoga is a discipline. It at times feels almost like a lost art form in popular western asana. Today’s practice invites us to have fun, to notice how you feel, and soften to the present moment on the journey to find balance in opposition. <br /><br />If you want to get stronger and feel more secure, implement softness. <br /><br />Let me know how you are feeling in the comment section below! <br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - <br /><br />🖤 MOVE - Downloadable Collection 🤍<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/move-collection">https://bit.ly/move-collection</a><br />Based on requests from the community, we are excited to announce a downloadable version of MOVE.
