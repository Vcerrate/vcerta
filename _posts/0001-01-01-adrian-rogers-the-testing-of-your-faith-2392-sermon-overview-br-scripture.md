{% raw %}Sermon Overview<br />Scripture Passage: Hebrews 11:17-19<br /><br />Throughout life, we will experience two kinds of tests: those that cause us to stumble, and those that cause us to stand. The devil will tempt us to do evil, while God tests us to do good and make our faith strong and pure.<br /><br />But God may ask us to do something that surprises us, and our response will reveal our true faith. In Hebrews 11, we are reminded of when Abraham’s faith was tested.<br /><br />“By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, of whom it was said, ‘In Isaac your seed shall be called,’ concluding that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense” (Hebrews 11:17-19).<br /><br />When we face trials and temptations, there are three questions we should ask ourselves to pass the test of our faith.<br /><br />Can I trust God with the possessions He has given to me?<br />God tested Abraham’s faith by asking him to give back his only beloved son, Isaac. God wanted to know if Abraham loved Him more than he loved Isaac. God does not want a place in our lives; He desires, deserves, and demands preeminence in our lives. We need to consider if there is anything we would not give back to God if He asked for it.<br /><br />Can I trust God with the purpose He has for me?<br />Adrian Rogers says, “Faith is not primarily believing God in spite of the evidence; it is obeying God in spite of the consequences, not having to know why.” Obedience is the proof of our trust in God. We must be informed, intentional and impassioned about seeking the will of God for our lives.<br /><br />Can I trust God with the promises He has made to me?<br />God had already miraculously fulfilled His promises to Abraham before. Though he did not know how He’d do it, Abraham knew God would keep His promises again; and He did. God provided a ram to take Isaac’s place on the altar and gave Abraham back his son.<br /><br />Adrian Rogers says, “We don’t live by explanation; we live by promises.”<br /><br />Apply it to your life<br />Is your faith being tested right now? Remember: the trials that come from God are tailor-made. He knows where you are and He knows your circumstances. Have faith in Him.<br /><br />-<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If you would like more information, please visit our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.lwf.org/">http://www.lwf.org/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />  Follow on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/lwfministries">https://twitter.com/lwfministries</a><br /><br />  Follow on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lwfministries/">https://www.instagram.com/lwfministries/</a><br /><br />  Like on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/lwfministries">https://www.facebook.com/lwfministries</a><br /><br />  Youtube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/lwfministries">https://www.youtube.com/lwfministries</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Write to us:<br /><br />Love Worth Finding Ministries<br /><br />P.O.
