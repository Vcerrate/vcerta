{% raw %}Dr Joe Dispenza (author, researcher, speaker) breaks down practical steps we can take to unlock our potential. He discusses his early days of hypnotizing his roommates, the philosophy of yoga, and the three different types of stress. Dr Joe explains the neuroscience behind why rumination and invoking feelings of the past are harmful to personal growth and how biochemistry can impact pathways. He considers the reason most change is facilitated by crisis or trauma, the benefits of mental rehearsal, and somatic reactions to emotional responses. <br /><br />---<br /><br /><br />Ask Mayim Anything: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bialikbreakdown.com​​">https://www.bialikbreakdown.com​​</a><br />Listen on Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6TgOe2poCdpZtQwKetQmU1">https://open.spotify.com/show/6TgOe2poCdpZtQwKetQmU1</a><br />Listen on Apple Podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mayim-bialiks-breakdown/id1546456269">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mayim-bialiks-breakdown/id1546456269</a><br />Sign up for Mayim Bialik's Breakdown Newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bialikbreakdown.com​​">https://www.bialikbreakdown.com​​</a><br /><br />Find Mayim Bialik:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MissMayim/​​​">https://www.facebook.com/MissMayim/​​​</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/MissMayim/​​​">https://www.twitter.com/MissMayim/​​​</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/MissMayim/​​​">https://www.instagram.com/MissMayim/​​​</a><br /><br />Find Dr Joe Dispenza:<br />Twitter: @DrJoeDispenza<br />Instagram: @DrJoeDispenza<br /><br />Theme Song Written, Produced and Performed by Ed Robertson.
