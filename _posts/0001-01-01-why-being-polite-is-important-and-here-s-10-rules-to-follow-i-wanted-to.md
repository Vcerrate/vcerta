{% raw %}I wanted to talk about why being polite is important in this video. Not only would it build an excellent reputation, but it also boosts your confidence and communication skills. <br /><br />Polite is a form of etiquette that needs to be taken seriously, not just for business, but in our personal lives. A code of behaviour that's fading due to our digital era where people to people bonding seems harder to grasp and understand. But by learning to be more polite is a great start and will never be out of style. <br /><br />Here are 10 Rules to Follow:<br />1. Smile and say hello to people.<br />2. Always use 'Please' and 'thank you.' <br />3. Praise or congratulate people on their achievements.<br />4. Try to remember things about the people you've spoken to.<br />5. Respect other people's time. <br />6. Be Punctual<br />7. Learn to Listen.<br />8. Avoid Gossip<br />9. Apologize for your Mistakes<br />10. Don't pick your nose, ears, play with your food or chew your fingernails. <br /><br />Do you have anything else to add to this list? I would love to hear from you!
