{% raw %}Here we introduce a &quot;polynomial-time reduction,&quot; which is one in which takes polynomial time (obviously). We also introduce the notion of NP-hardness and NP-completeness. We then show that if a problem is NP-complete, and is also in P, then P = NP.<br /><br />Easy Theory Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.easytheory.org">https://www.easytheory.org</a><br />Become a member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3VY6RTXegnoSD_q446oBdg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3VY6RTXegnoSD_q446oBdg/join</a><br />Donation (appears on streams): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://streamlabs.com/easytheory1/tip">https://streamlabs.com/easytheory1/tip</a><br />Paypal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/easytheory">https://paypal.me/easytheory</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/easytheory">https://www.patreon.com/easytheory</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/SD4U3hs">https://discord.gg/SD4U3hs</a><br /><br />Merch:<br />Language Hierarchy Apparel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/language-hierarchy?pid=2&amp;cid=2122">https://teespring.com/language-hierarchy?pid=2&amp;cid=2122</a><br />Pumping Lemma Apparel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/pumping-lemma-for-regular-lang">https://teespring.com/pumping-lemma-for-regular-lang</a><br /><br />If you like this content, please consider subscribing to my channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3VY6RTXegnoSD_q446oBdg?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3VY6RTXegnoSD_q446oBdg?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />▶SEND ME THEORY QUESTIONS◀<br />ryan.e.dougherty@icloud.com<br /><br />▶ABOUT ME◀<br />I am a professor of Computer Science, and am passionate about CS theory.
