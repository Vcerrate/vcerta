{% raw %}What The Russian Central Bank Ruble-Gold Peg Means For Gold &amp; Silver ► <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU1ZPgOcJ7Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU1ZPgOcJ7Q</a><br /><br />On Friday Vladimir Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the idea of backing the Ruble with gold was being discussed in the Kremlin.  In addition, Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said in an interview that backing the Ruble with gold &amp; a basket of commodities was the best way to ensure the sovereignty of the Russian currency.<br /><br />However, the head of the Russian Central Bank, Elvira Nabiullina, was quoted as saying that the concept of a gold backed Ruble was not being considered at all, and that the Ruble needed to maintain a floating exchange rate.<br /><br />Of course this is not the first time we've heard of the idea of some link between the Ruble &amp; gold, back at the beginning of April the Russian central bank announced it would purchase gold at the fixed price of 5000 Rubles per gram.  Just a few weeks later however, the Ruble had appreciated significantly and the bank announced an end to these fixed price purchases.<br /><br />Will we see a Ruble backed by gold and other commodities anytime soon?  It seems unlikely, however this is exactly what Credit Suisse analyst Zoltan Poszar forecast in March in his document titled &quot;Breton Woods III&quot;<br />And if we do see a transition to commodity backed money in the east, this could create significant downward pressure on the dollar, and could be a major catalyst for the dollar price of gold and silver moving much higher.<br /><br />Let me know what you think in the comments, thanks for watching!<br /><br />Use coupon code &quot;stacker&quot; to save 10% on nanosilver powered personal care products from Silver Botanicals ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://silver-botanicals.com">https://silver-botanicals.com</a><br /><br />Great prices on silver bullion at SD Bullion  ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3JzeeTi">https://bit.ly/3JzeeTi</a><br /><br />Follow me on Twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ugCoLx">https://bit.ly/3ugCoLx</a><br /><br />Follow me on Instagram ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ubjs0V">https://bit.ly/3ubjs0V</a><br /><br />Nothing in this video is financial advice.
