{% raw %}Welcome to this new episode of DataFriday, I know, it's been a while. I have been really busy studying (and maybe implementing) Data Meshes and I wanted to share with you some of my discoveries. <br /><br />As enterprises become more agile, centralization appears to be a thing of the past world â€“ the waterfall world. The same appears to be true for data platforms. This is why Data Mesh, a new generation of data platforms, is being constructed. <br /><br />About the show: <br />DataFriday is a weekly show on all things data, including things around data like architecture, cloud, AI, and so much more. It has different lengths and content formats, like the variable-length Varchar Lecture.<br /><br />About Jean-Georges Perrin: <br />Jean-Georges &quot;jgp&quot; Perrin is a technology leader focusing on building innovative and modern data platforms at PayPal, president of AIDAUG, and author of Spark in Action, 2nd edition (Manning). He is passionate about software engineering and all things data, small and big data. His latest endeavors bring to more and more data engineering, data governance, and his favorite theme, the industrialization of data science. He is proud to have been recognized as a Lifetime IBM Champion.
