{% raw %}I invited Preston Dennett to talk about his UFO researches over his entire storied career.  He asked if he could bring Dolly Safran with him--I knew absolutely nothing about her prior to the show.  <br /><br />She turns out to be a lifetime experiencer of Grey Extraterrestrials--and has bonded with the crew that most often took her.<br /><br />Like most folks who have bonded with the ETs they have interacted with, she believes every word they have told her and there is no room in her view for anyone else's experiences or understanding.<br /><br />Description from Preston Dennett:<br /><br />For most of her life, Dolly has kept her encounters a complete secret. But now, she has agreed to come forward and tell the world the truth about the UFO presence on our planet. ETs are not abducting people against their will. They are not here to hurt anyone or take over our planet. The truth is, they are here to help, to heal, to guide and enlighten. They are here, Dolly says, to ensure that everyone survives the many challenges facing humanity today.<br /><br />Written by veteran UFO researcher Preston Dennett, and told largely in the witness’s own words, Dolly’s story will change the way you think about extraterrestrials and their agenda on our planet. Says Preston Dennett: “Dolly’s story is the single most extensive account of ET contact I have ever investigated or even read about.”<br /><br />This book is not only a gripping true-life adventure story, it answers many of the questions surrounding the UFO phenomenon. Why are they here? Where do they come from? What is the alien agenda on our planet? Fully illustrated with eyewitness drawings and UFO photographs, “Symmetry: A True UFO Adventure,” contains a profound message to all humanity directly from the ETs.<br /><br />Preston Dennett first began investigating UFOs in 1986 after learning that his family friends and co-workers were having encounters. Since then, he has interviewed hundreds of people and investigated a wide variety of cases. He has written 29 books and more than 100 articles about UFOs and the paranormal. He is a frequent guest on radio and TV, and speaks across the United States. He currently resides in southern California.<br /><br />Dolly Safran has worked as a limo driver, assistant manager at Wendy’s, a zookeeper, a bus driver, a security guard, a nurse, and more, including as a civilian worker for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and also in the Army as an employee for the U.S. Department of Defense. Her UFO contacts began around age one, and are still ongoing today.<br /><br />Preston Dennett is on Facebook.<br /><br />His books:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/entity/author/B0034PEPRC">https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/entity/author/B0034PEPRC</a><br /><br />His documentaries:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5087682/">https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5087682/</a><br /><br />Youtube:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOntTQrEbD94Gjfc0UXC46A">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOntTQrEbD94Gjfc0UXC46A</a><br /><br />Dolly can be contacted through Preston.<br /><br />To contact Penny: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.spaceportals.net​​​​">https://www.spaceportals.net​​​​</a> <br />A free-to-join modern forum site, registration best done from a computer.<br /><br />Radio show is Saturdays 2-4 pm Pacific on<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.GERN-Radio.com">https://www.GERN-Radio.com</a><br /><br />Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=15523662&amp;fan_landing=true">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=15523662&amp;fan_landing=true</a><br /><br /> MUSIC: <br /><br />The song at the beginning is used with permission from Pyramids On Mars. <br /><br />It is called &quot;Nacht Waffen&quot; and is from the album &quot;Edge Of The Black&quot; was out on Christmas 2019. <br /><br />You may order through: <br /><br />Order at : www.pyramidsonmars.com <br />Order at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pyramids-on-mars.myshopify.com/">https://pyramids-on-mars.myshopify.com/</a>{% endraw %}
