Yeah, woo hoo!<br /><br />Bouncing on a bumpy road,<br />Stopping for a hopping toad,<br />Going to my favorite park,<br />Hurry before it gets dark,<br />In my car,<br />In my car.<br /><br />Driving, driving in my car,<br />Going very far,<br />Down the street in my car.<br /><br />Driving, driving in my car,<br />Feeling like a star,<br />Bouncing down the street in my car.<br /><br />Driving, driving in my car,<br />Turn the handle bar,<br />Speeding down the street in my car. Vroom! Vroom!<br /><br />Hootin' tootin' on the horn,<br />Driving round from dusk till dawn,<br />Going near and going far,<br />I'm a superstar, whoo!<br />In my car, Vroom! Vroom!<br />In my car.<br /><br />Driving, in my car.<br />Driving, in my car.<br />Driving, in my car.<br />Driving.<br /><br />-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-<br />Please watch: &quot;Nursery Rhymes for Kids by Mother Goose Club | Driving in My Car + Road Trip Adventure Phonics Songs&quot; <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui2Em_TGgw8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui2Em_TGgw8</a><br />-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-{% endraw %}
