{% raw %}Plarail Tokaido Shinkansen 700 series and Shinkansen N700S confirmation test vehicle intermediate set were combined and ran in a 13-car train! For the course, we assembled TAKARATOMY &quot;Let's run the Plarail elevated! Shinkansen rail set&quot;. The Shinkansen also ran a 6-car train, Alpha X. JR trains run Chuggington Wrapping Train, Pokemon with You Train, Sound Enoden Type 500, Sound E231 Series Sobu Line, and Train Sweet Shikishima.<br />It's amazing when many trains and bullet trains run.<br />TAKARATOMY products give children dreams and knowledge.<br /><br /><br />#JR #Plarail #Shinkansen{% endraw %}
