I'm Alanna - a twenty-something documenting my life as a Canadian living in England.<br /><br />I share the ups and downs of an expat living abroad and what it's really like living in the UK. It's not always easy, but there's been so many wonderful experiences, too. I post a Youtube video every Tuesday &amp; Friday plus an additional video every Saturday on my Patreon account. I also livestream every Wednesday and Sunday at 5:30pm GMT on Twitch.<br /><br />Alanna x{% endraw %}
