Will those sanctions destabilize Putin and cause Russia to withdraw? This video examines the most likely way that would happen. The elimination of international transactions could cause a bank run in Russia, which in turn will destabilize their entire economy. At the very least, this will make it difficult to sustain a long war or occupation. The deeper goal is to cause enough domestic upheaval that Putin will be removed from power, or that Putin will withdraw under the threat of such removal.<br /><br />Images licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en):">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en):</a> Xi and Putin by Kremlin.ru (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/58112/photos),">http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/58112/photos),</a> Russian military by Kremlin.ru (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/49437/photos),">http://www.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/49437/photos),</a> Mariinsky Palace by Roman Naumov (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%96%D1%97%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%86_%D0%B2_%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%94%D0%B2%D1%96_(cropped).jpg),">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%96%D1%97%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%86_%D0%B2_%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%94%D0%B2%D1%96_(cropped).jpg),</a> Putin by Kremlin.ru (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/65079/photos/65300)">http://www.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/65079/photos/65300)</a><br /><br />Images licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en):">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en):</a> Moscow by A Savin (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moscow_05-2012_Kremlin_22.jpg)">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moscow_05-2012_Kremlin_22.jpg)</a><br /><br />Images licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0 (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/deed.en):">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/deed.en):</a> European Central Bank by Kiefer (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/xingxiyang/19190136328/)">https://www.flickr.com/photos/xingxiyang/19190136328/)</a>{% endraw %}
