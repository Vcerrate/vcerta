{% raw %}WHEN Michael Rogosin got his first dog six years ago, a Belgian Malinois called Ares, he couldn't find a dog training group that matched his needs or vision. Michael had the ambition to train Ares to the highest standard possible so that the canine would be qualified as a K9 for Navy Seal and law enforcement. He also had the dream of abseiling down a building with Ares on his back. When Michael, who didn't have any prior experience, decided to train Ares himself, others called him an 'idiot'. Michael said: &quot;[Belgian Malinois] is not the dog for a first-time pet owner. You have to have experience. I was scared but I was totally focused on the results.&quot; Michael wasn't put off by people's comments and kept going. He incorporated his military experience into his training methods and took to social media to document his journey. It was also through his social media that Michael has caught the attention of high-end clients and military around the world, including armed forces in Belgium, Spain and Germany. After becoming a licensed dog trainer, Michael set up his own dog training company, Tactical K9 Family, to take his dreams even further. Michael has purchased a second dog, Athena, and is planning to move to Los Angeles to continue building his business.<br /><br />Follow Michael and Tactical K9 Family here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tactical_k9_family/">https://www.instagram.com/tactical_k9_family/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tactical_k9_family">https://www.tiktok.com/@tactical_k9_family</a><br /><br />Follow your favourite Beastly shows on Instagram! <br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />Check out more videos here! <br />Truly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
