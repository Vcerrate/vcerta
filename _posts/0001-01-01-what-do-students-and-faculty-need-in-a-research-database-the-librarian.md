The types of resources librarians would create with their magic wands<br /><br />You’ll hear what your fellow librarians have learned from their users, and how their insights may change the direction of your academic collection.<br /><br />Get your copy of the report here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/ACRL19-Web.">http://bit.ly/ACRL19-Web.</a>{% endraw %}
