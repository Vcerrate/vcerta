{% raw %}Pasta Mancini is one of Italy's top dried pasta brands, and here Lorenzo Settimi explains what to look for in good quality pasta. He made a fantastic duck ragu to go with his trufoli. The duck was properly free range, his tomato passata homemade and so on. <br /><br />btw if you want a high definition version of this video (for bigger screens) head on over to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/3jCZS1XA3XM.">https://youtu.be/3jCZS1XA3XM.</a> <br /><br />If you want to make the ragu yourself:<br />Take 1 free range duck, jointed into 8 portions. Keep the meat on the bone. Fry these in a little olive oil and put to one side. Saute one onion, carrot, and celery stick (all finely diced) in the fat until soft. Return the duck pieces, deglaze with a glass of dry aromatic white wine (not red); add rosemary, marjoram and a bayleaf, plus a litre of tomato passata. Season with a good teaspoon of salt. Cover and simmer very slowly until the meat pulls very easily from the bone - the length of time will depend on the robustness of your duck; but think 2 hours minimum. <br /><br />Serve with trufoli, pappardelle, rigatoni - big pasta shapes which can handle the ragu.{% endraw %}
