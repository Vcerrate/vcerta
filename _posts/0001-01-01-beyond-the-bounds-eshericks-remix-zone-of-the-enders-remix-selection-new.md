{% raw %}(NEW UPDATE) Okay, it look a while to find a new link, but here you all go: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.zerochan.net/1316706">https://www.zerochan.net/1316706</a> (if this one goes down, just google it)<br /><br />This past tuesday, I picked up the Limited Edition of the Zone of the Enders HD Collection, and a CD of the ReMIX SELECTION came with it. I normally don't upload music on here, but because this remix is so awesome and hands down my favorite song on the whole album (and also the fact that no one else uploaded it yet), I figured I'd put it up for all of you ZOE fans.<br /><br />THIS SONG IS NOT OWNED BY ME. Blah blah blah, legal stuff, Zone of the Enders is owned by Konami and Hideo Kojima, and this song is owned by K A R Y Y N and Eshericks.<br /><br />Just enjoy the damn song.{% endraw %}
