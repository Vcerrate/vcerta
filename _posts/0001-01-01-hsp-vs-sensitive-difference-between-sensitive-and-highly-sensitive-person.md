{% raw %}Sensitive vs HSP: Difference Between Sensitive and Highly Sensitive Person. In this video, we cover the difference between HSPs and sensitive people.<br /><br />Highly sensitive people, or HSPs, are people who are more sensitive to the subtleties of their surroundings, have brains that process and reflect information more thoroughly, are often socially constrained by nature, and prefer their own rich inner world to the outside world. Because they take in more information, HSPs are more likely to develop nervous system overstimulation. It's vital to remember that sensitivity is an innate rather than learned characteristic.<br /><br />Dr. Elaine Aron and colleagues discovered that the extreme sensitivity feature occurs in roughly 20% of the population, in both people and animals, in their research. This evidence backs up the theory that the characteristic has an evolutionary advantage. Perhaps the tribal members who were more sensitive to changes in the village's air, sights, and noises served as the proverbial canary in the coal mine.<br /><br />Most people are familiar with what defines a sensitive person. Today, we are going to go over the qualities of highly sensitive people, so that we can discover what the differences are. We recommend you stick with us until the end, since the last point is the most interesting.<br />___<br />ðŸ“•FREE GUIDE on 5 Ways to Combat Narcissistic Abuse: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://psychologyelement.com/narc-abuse-free-guide/">https://psychologyelement.com/narc-abuse-free-guide/</a><br />___<br />ðŸ§ RECOMMENDED VIDEOS:<br /><br />Can You Relate? 13 Problems Only Highly Sensitive People Will Understand<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00M5fOnvFZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00M5fOnvFZw</a><br /><br />12 Signs You've Met a Sociopath But Just Don't Know It<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww4UpsMCeOY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww4UpsMCeOY</a><br /><br />10 Problems Only Smart People Have (Highly Intelligent People Problems)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5WptpnJ0T8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5WptpnJ0T8</a><br /><br />___<br />ðŸ“ºHIGHLY SENSITIVE PEOPLE PLAYLIST:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIOgCieADVYeK_xvyALsfsFCiTACNtnB">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIOgCieADVYeK_xvyALsfsFCiTACNtnB</a><br />___<br />ðŸ‘•MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://psychologyelement.com/merch/">https://psychologyelement.com/merch/</a><br />___<br />Psychology Element helps you to understand your own psychology, your relationships, and various mental disorders.
