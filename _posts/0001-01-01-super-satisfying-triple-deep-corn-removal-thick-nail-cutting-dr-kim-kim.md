{% raw %}Hello everyone! This week, I had a longtime patient in my office for a deep corn removal of not one, not two, but THREE corns stuck in both of her feet! In addition, I was able to get her a clean nail trimming on some long, thick toenails. Stay tuned until the end to see the before and after results!<br /><br />Visit Kim Foot &amp; Ankle Center in Long Beach:<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kimfoot.com/​​​​">https://kimfoot.com/​​​​</a><br /><br />Follow Kim Foot &amp; Ankle:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kimfootlb/">https://www.instagram.com/kimfootlb/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Kimfoot/​​​​">https://www.facebook.com/Kimfoot/​​​​</a><br /><br />Follow Dr. Kim for more wellness tips:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/DrKimWellness/">https://www.instagram.com/DrKimWellness/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/DrKimWellness/">https://www.facebook.com/DrKimWellness/</a><br /><br />Got a minute?
