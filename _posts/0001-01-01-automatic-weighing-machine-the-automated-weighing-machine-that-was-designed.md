{% raw %}The automated weighing machine, that was designed and built at NIOZ, has the capacity to weight 9000 crucibles a day, with a precision of a tenth of a milligram. It plays a pivotal role in the SIBES project that covers more than 5000 sampling stations across the Dutch Wadden Sea, including parts of the German Wadden Sea. The samples are weighed three times: dry weight, ash-free dry weight and finally the empty weight of the crucible. Comparisons of these values yield energy values.{% endraw %}
