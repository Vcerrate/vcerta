When we meet him, the man who will become Saul Goodman is known as Jimmy McGill, a small-time lawyer searching for his destiny, and, more immediately, hustling to make ends meet. Working alongside, and often against, Jimmy is &quot;fixer&quot; Mike Erhmantraut (Jonathan Banks), a beloved character introduced in Breaking Bad. The series will track Jimmy's transformation into Saul Goodman, the man who puts &quot;criminal&quot; in &quot;criminal lawyer.&quot;<br /><br />#BetterCallSaul #BreakingBad #Sony<br /><br />Video Title<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/breakingbad/featured">https://www.youtube.com/c/breakingbad/featured</a>{% endraw %}
