Historically, these beings haven’t been referred to as completely physical, but rather tend to be described as more spirit like. During more recent times, fairies are commonly depicted as friendly, helpful and loving creatures, but for the remainder of this video, you’re going to have to get this visualisation out of your mind. As far as I can gather there is no singular, specific origin of the fae, but rather there are a collection of beliefs and reported incidents that have occurred throughout Europe and other continents around the world too, which I suppose could be considered fairly strange. There are also similarities between the traditional European folklore and folklore from other places around the world such as the Southern Americas, which we’ll come to later.<br /><br />Before we go any further and start delving into this, I want to make it abundantly clear that nothing in this video relates to my own personal views. This purpose of this video is not to mock anyone, nor will it be in support of any point of view, but rather I’m going to try to come at this from a completely neutral perspective and this is something I want you to bear in mind throughout. I don’t have a stake in the topic.<br /><br />Fairies: Strange Encounters and The Missing 411 Connection?<br />Missing 411 Fairies<br /><br />Music by CO.AG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA</a><br /><br />My links: <br />➥Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user/overview?u=11624816">https://www.patreon.com/user/overview?u=11624816</a> <br />➥Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/top-mysteries-2">https://teespring.com/stores/top-mysteries-2</a><br />➥Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TopMysteries?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/TopMysteries?sub_confirmation=1</a> <br />➥Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Unanswered5s">https://twitter.com/Unanswered5s</a><br /><br />► Sources:<br />Click here ➥ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z_cHgnDtrZm5iNNGpAxwfFCKDX5tGqXoNMBTmO1rZfU/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z_cHgnDtrZm5iNNGpAxwfFCKDX5tGqXoNMBTmO1rZfU/edit?usp=sharing</a>{% endraw %}
