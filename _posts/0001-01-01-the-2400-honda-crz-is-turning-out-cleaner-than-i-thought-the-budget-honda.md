{% raw %}The budget Honda CRZ Build returns with some GREAT progress! Everything from extreme paintless dent repair, wrapping the roof, and paint touch-up has made this a CLEAN starting point. From here we can start on the mods I've been looking forward to! So of course I had to start with a steering wheel badge and JDM yellow lights lol!<br /><br />While I don't like to cut corners on my car builds, the CRZ worked out in my favor on what I wanted to do. This car had some SERIOUS clearcoat failure on the roof and hatch with more dents than I could count. Instead of a costly trip to the body shop, I chose to vinyl wrap the areas that had major sun exposure. For this I used Avery Dennison gloss black wrap and had my friend Josh tackle the install. He was able to neatly wrap around the sharkfin (which I thought was cool). We used knifeless tape to create a taper on the hatch for a unique look as well! <br /><br />Now, how to remove the dents from the car was an entirely different story. Eric from carmedic worked some wizardry that I didn't even think was possible.  We dropped the headliner for the roof (not fun) and removed everything we could see. The door and rear quarter dents were what I would deem salvage worthy. To my astound amazement, Eric was able to remove them and re-mold the body lines back to perfect. Seriously, it was wild. From there I could tackle all the paint touch up around the car to get it back to an acceptable amount of wear. <br /><br />For my first easy mods, I went full ricer and installed yellow DRL/high beams on the Honda, because JDM. The OEM steering wheel emblem was already shot, so I ordered a J's racing Blue Honda badge to install over it. Overall, I'm PUMPED that this car is turning out how it is. I've probably saved over $2,000 in paintwork by wrapping and getting the PDR done. We're another step closer to a CLEANER CRZ! Let's keep it going!<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />- ALLDAYANTHONY{% endraw %}
