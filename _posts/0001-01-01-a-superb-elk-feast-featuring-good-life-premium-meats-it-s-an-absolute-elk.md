{% raw %}It's an absolute Elk Feast out on the SmokeyGoodness Stage!<br />Featuring the finest of Elk products from Good Life Premium Meats, we have an 8oz Elk Ribeye as well as 4 (precooked) large Elk Sausage links. I don't know exactly why I kept referring to these links as &quot;brats&quot;... My mistake.<br />The Elk Sausage links are pre-cooked, only needing to be warmed up, but we decided to also give 'em a good char over the coals. Taking a page from a recent SG video, the sausages were injected with Dorothy Lynch Salad Dressing. The result was awesome!<br />The 8 ounce Elk Ribeye may look small, but it was loaded with flavor. We gave it an initial quick sear (to lock in the juices), and then low-n-slowed it to an internal temp of about 120 degrees F. <br /><br />Check out Nebraska Bison and Good Life Premium Meats at;<br />www.nebraskabison/smokeygoodness<br /><br />AND, get a 10% discount on your first order with the promo code &quot;SMOKEYGOODNESS&quot;<br /><br />Music provided by<br />Audio Network{% endraw %}
