{% raw %}In this live video from Cl√≠nica M√©dico Dental Pardi√±as it's show how to treat a bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw<br /><br /><br />Medication Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (MRONJ) is an adverse effect of antiresorptive and antiangiogenic agents, such as Bisfosfonates, that consists of progressive bone destruction in the maxillofacial area.<br /><br /><br />It¬¥s clinically characterized by an avascular area of non-healing necrotic bone in the maxillofacial area that has persisted for longer than 8 weeks, with or without exposed bone, in patients exposed to antiresorptive and antiangiogenic drug treatment with no evidence of metastatic disease in the jaw and no history of craniofacial radiation. Other clinical signs such<br />as mucosal swelling, abscesses and diffuse pain have also been described. <br /><br /><br />If left untreated, the lesion can progress and end up with neural involvement with altered sensation, oro-antral or oro-nasal communications, fistulae or mandibular fractures.<br /><br /><br />The management of patients with MRONJ is still challenging. The<br />goal of treatment of these patients is the preservation of quality of life<br />by eliminating pain, managing infection, stopping the progression of<br />the necrosis and preventing the development of new areas of necrosis.<br /><br />Treatment strategies such as administrations of antibiotics, antibacterial mouth rinse, surgical debridement, cessation of antiresorptive medication, pain control, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, laser appliance, covering exposed areas with local flaps or growth factors, among others, have been described. <br /><br />However, there is currently no gold standard treatment for MRONJ.<br />Recently, treatments that enhance wound healing by using growth<br />factors have opened a promising way to successfully treat this medical<br />condition.<br /><br />The use of autologous growth factors, such as plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF), has demonstrated the potential to influence healing bone and soft tissue defects. <br /><br />PRGF is an autologous platelet-enriched plasma obtained from the patient's own blood. This material releases active proteins that<br />can influence and promote cell recruitment, growth, and differentiation,<br />stimulate the production of collagen and improve soft and hard<br />tissue wound healing. The PRGF has been used during the treatment<br />and as a prevention alternative for MRONJ.<br /><br />#osteonecrosis #pov #growthfactors<br /> <br />Subscribe to our Youtube channel üëâ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/suscribeteCP">http://bit.ly/suscribeteCP</a> <br /><br />MORE VIDEOS in English üëâ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://j.mp/dentistry3D">http://j.mp/dentistry3D</a><br /><br />Follow us also on: <br />üëç Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/clinicapardinas">https://www.instagram.com/clinicapardinas</a> <br />üëç Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/clinicapardinas">https://www.facebook.com/clinicapardinas</a> <br />üëç Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ClinicaPardinas">https://twitter.com/ClinicaPardinas</a> <br />üëç Linkedin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/clinica-pardinas">https://www.linkedin.com/company/clinica-pardinas</a> <br />üëç Tiktok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSH7hMJb/">https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSH7hMJb/</a><br />üëç Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.es/clinicapardinas/">https://www.pinterest.es/clinicapardinas/</a>{% endraw %}
