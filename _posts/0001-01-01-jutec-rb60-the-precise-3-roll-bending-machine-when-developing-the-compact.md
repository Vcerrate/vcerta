{% raw %}When developing the compact and mobile horizontal bending machine the focus was clearly set on the production of true-to-size helices, like, for example, handrails for spiral staircases. This is the supreme discipline since two parameters influencing each other (radius and inclination) have to be united to a true-to-size geometry in a bend. The principle here is the interplay between tube calculation on the PC, implementation on the bending machine and then control via measuring devices with final correction of the bending values, which ensures accurately fitting bending.<br /><br />More Information about the RB60:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.jutec.de/products/rb60/product-description">http://www.jutec.de/products/rb60/product-description</a>{% endraw %}
