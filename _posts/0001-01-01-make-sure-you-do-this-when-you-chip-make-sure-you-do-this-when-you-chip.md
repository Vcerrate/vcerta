{% raw %}Make sure you do this when you chip. When you are hitting chip shots and trying to get the ball close to the hole you really need to do this one thing. It does not matter how good your technique is. If you fail to do this one thing your ball will not finish anywhere near the hole.<br />==============================================================================<br />âœ…ðŸ”´âœ… My NEW Ultimate Indoor Putting Course can be found at:   <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thegolfdoctor.com.au/ultimate-indoor-putting-course/">https://www.thegolfdoctor.com.au/ultimate-indoor-putting-course/</a><br /><br />There are over 50 videos and 2 hours of content on how to improve all aspects of your putting at home using a putting mat or a strip of carpet.<br />There is a sections devoted to putter fitting, the 5 most common putting grips, putting mechanics and even green reading training at home.

The Morack Public GC in Vermont South and the Lang Lang GC in beautiful South Gippsland (An hour and a quarter from Melbourne) where there are lot's of Kangaroos. <br /><br /><br />FAQ:<br />How long have you been a golf coach? I qualified as a full member of the Australian PGA back in 1985. Wow I don't feel that old.<br /><br />Why do you make videos for YouTube? That is a great question and one I get asked a lot. I love helping people play better golf and people tell me I have a very unique coaching style that is very simple to understand. We really should do things simpler. I just make them to help people and if people like my videos they can either come for a golf lesson in person or if that is not possible you could join my membership program and I can then view your golf swing or any part of your game and really help improve what you do.<br /><br />Do you always change some ones golf swing? To be perfectly honest I try not to. If I do try to change some ones golf swing I have to have a pretty good reason for doing so and the client has to be fully engaged and committed to both regular coaching and practice in order to make that change. Most people say they will do both with good intentions but most fall away pretty quickly.<br /><br />So my preference is to change things that will improve their score easily. There are so many different ways to do this.<br /><br />What do you film with? - I have a few few different cameras I use. An old GoPro Hero 4, an iPhone 6 and iPhone X, A Sony ZV1 and an old Panasonic Handy cam (I'm using that less and less now). I record my sound on an old iPhone 4.<br /><br />What do you edit with? - About a year ago I switched to Adobe Premiere - prior to that it was Pinnacle Studio<br /><br />Do you make money off YouTube? - Yes.It took me over 100 videos to make my first total $100 off adsense and then another 50 videos to make my next $100. I think it will slowly change, but VERY slowly.<br /><br />I really enjoy your videos, how can I support you? - Here's my ko-fi where you can buy me a coffee, beer or a burger should you wish (kind of like giving me a tip via : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/thegolfdoctor">https://ko-fi.com/thegolfdoctor</a><br /><br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br />Brian{% endraw %}
