{% raw %}Active violence can happen anywhere, at any time. These terrifying events continue to happen, which is why knowing what to do during one is vital. Our Active Violence Emergency Response Training (AVERT) is for individuals as well as groups and can save lives.<br />Developed by a law enforcement officer with 30 years of experience in tandem with a PhD expert advisor, our training goes beyond what you will find anywhere else. You will learn not only how to protect yourself, but how to save those around you during a violent attack. You will experience realistic training situations where you will learn the proper methods and decision-making to escape, evade, or attack. <br /><br />The knowledge you will gain with AVERT is literally the difference between life and death.
