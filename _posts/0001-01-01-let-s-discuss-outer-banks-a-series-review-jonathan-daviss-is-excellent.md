{% raw %}in today's video i want to discuss outer banks and provide a review for the show. *spolier alert*  it far exceeded all of my expectations. let's chat!<br /><br />i had no intention of watching this shpow it was recommended to me by netflix and that's honestly how the story starts. i watched both seasons, all ten episodes in 2 days and i knew that I had to make a video about it. It was all excellent and i will be waiting not so patiently for outer banks season 3. <br /><br />discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/jZ2hc8HW">https://discord.gg/jZ2hc8HW</a><br />twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Gabby_Moonchild">https://twitter.com/Gabby_Moonchild</a><br />medium: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://medium.com/@gabbyhasthoughts">https://medium.com/@gabbyhasthoughts</a>{% endraw %}
