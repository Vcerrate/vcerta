The rapper publicly wooed Kim, and was a part of her becoming who she is today - and we got a front row seat, to watch their relationship evolve. While the couple are heading for divorce, we remember the good old days where Kim and Kanye were very much Kimye. From the time the two attended Scott’s restaurant opening, to their Cuban vacation and even the time Kanye got rid of everything in Kim’s closet - every moment showed a special bond between the two.<br />What is your favourite Kanye moment on Keeping Up With The Kardashians!?
