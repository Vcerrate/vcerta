{% raw %}Check out ‘People Who Died’ by The Jim Carroll Band off their album ‘Catholic Boy’. Recently featured in the new 'Suicide Squad 2' film. <br /><br />Jim Carroll expressed the Bomb-fear anticipation, the optimistic nihilism and glittering darkness of the 1980s that we who were there felt even if we couldn’t communicate it ourselves. When John Lennon was assassinated in front of the Dakota in December 1980, “People Who Died” was one of the most-requested songs on FM radio, just after Lennon’s own “Imagine.” Steven Spielberg chose “People Who Died” to play during the opening scene of E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. “People Who Died” tapped a mainline. It was a hit even before it was released, and, as Newsweek’s Barbara Graustark noted, it “propelled [Carroll] from underground status… to national attention as a contender for the title of rock’s new poet laureate.”<br /><br />Buy 'Catholic Boy' on LP, CD &amp; Digital: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://JimCarroll.lnk.to/CatholicBoyID">https://JimCarroll.lnk.to/CatholicBoyID</a><br />
