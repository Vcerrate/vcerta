{% raw %}How Meghan Markle’s attention grabbing ways are stealing focus from the Invictus Games veterans, as she attempts to put on an Oscar worthy performance as a charming and charitable woman.<br /><br />Meghan Markle is many things, but a great actress isn’t one of them. But she’s doing her best this week to look engaged and interested in her husband’s crowning achievement, the Invictus Games for veterans from mostly North America, Europe and Australia (as one person pointed out, the representatives from countries of color is pretty minimal).<br /><br />To make sure she looks as good as possible, Meghan is putting on a performance for both those gathered and Netflix, who is producing a reality television show for the couple and the documentary “Heart of Invictus.” Her obscenely expensive Invictus wardrobe is already closing in on $100k, with some of the most ridiculously expensive items including a $40k necklace from Cartier and a pair of sunglasses costing a rather ridiculous $1,000.<br /><br />But hey, anything to help support our veterans.<br /><br />Ironically, few of the attendees are seemingly interested in Meghan Markle. The cheers overall were fewer for even Harry, and Meghan received little fanfare from anyone in attendance, with one person caught seemingly commenting that they “forgot she would be there,” as if her attendance at the meet and greet was nothing special.<br /><br />But if there’s a red carpet and a chance for Meghan to show off her six-figure wardrobe, she’ll be there. It’s not about charity, but about making sure that she gets the attention she deserves and Netflix gets something they can use for their upcoming reality television show so that Harry can continue buying her things from Hermes, Dior, Cartier and any other luxury house she wants.<br /><br />She is rather charitable, but only when it comes to filling her bank account.<br /><br />Royal News Network combines news and commentary, so certain points and conclusions are my own.<br /><br />This video is under Fair Use: <br />Section 107 of the Copyright Act provides the statutory framework for determining whether something is a fair use and identifies certain types of uses—such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research—as examples of activities that may qualify as fair use.<br /><br />All rights and credit go directly to its rightful owners.
