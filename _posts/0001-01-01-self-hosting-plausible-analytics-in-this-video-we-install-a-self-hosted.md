{% raw %}In this video we install a self-hosted web analytics tool on a server.<br /><br />So with our earlier video on self-hosting you might be looking at replacing Google Analytics. Especially as it gets deemed illegal in more countries and Google is switching versions on everyone. Why not give privacy a chance? Plausible Analytics should be a good solution to move you straight towards compliance, morals and ethics :)<br /><br />For more on the why, or if you missed it, see our video on why you might want to self-host: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liedaNuG6e8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liedaNuG6e8</a><br /><br />Big thanks to Glesys for sponsoring this video, it's a lot of fun doing these with them.
