{% raw %}Describing it as the &quot;slowest, lowest, and cheapest jet available, they had planned the jet with a 300 knots cruise speed at around 25,000 feet with a Williams FJ33 engine and a whole-airplane parachute recovery system and it was referred to as a &quot;personal jet.&quot; <br />In June 2008, at the annual Cirrus Owners and Pilots Association, the company unveiled the prototype publicly, and the jet made its maiden flight on July 3, 2008, at the Duluth airport. The following year, Cirrus was hit hard by the great recession and wanted to abandon the project due to a lack of funding, but CAIGA, a Chinese enterprise, came to the rescue. <br />The jet has undergone many changes in its name and was initially developed under the project name &quot;The Jet&quot; or &quot;The Jet by Cirrus&quot;. On July 9, 2008, Cirrus announced the marketing name of &quot;Vision SJ50&quot;, with &quot;V&quot; for the V-tail and &quot;SJ&quot; for the single-jet. By March 2009, the aircraft was re-designated as the &quot;Vision SF50&quot;, as it uses a single-fanjet engine. By April 2016, Cirrus was calling it the &quot;Vision Jet&quot; and on October 28, 2016, it was certified as the &quot;Model SF50&quot;.<br />#Cirrus  #CirrusVisionJet<br />_________________________________________________<br />To contact me directly: Dashboardglobal@techie.com <br />_________________________________________________<br />Our channel is about Aviation.<br />We make the best educational aviation videos you've ever seen; my videos are designed to clear misunderstandings about airplanes and explain complicated aviation topics in a simple way.{% endraw %}
