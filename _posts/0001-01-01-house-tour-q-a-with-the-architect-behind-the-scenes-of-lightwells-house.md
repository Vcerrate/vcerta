{% raw %}Architect shares his design concept and considerations behind this luxury build <br />READ MORE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.huntingforgeorge.com/blog/lightwells-house-avalon-beach-let-us-in/">https://www.huntingforgeorge.com/blog/lightwells-house-avalon-beach-let-us-in/</a><br /><br />We share a closer look and further conversation with Ian Bennett at the Lightwells House. Located in the northern beachside suburb of Avalon Beach in Sydney, the Lightwells House is an alteration and addition project to a home which the architect already had a connection to. Ian Bennett worked on level one of this renovation 10 years ago when he was working for a local architectural firm, but recently found himself running into the owner again and was asked if he would like to renovate level two and add a new third level. The result is a stunning beachside home which boasts amazing views and is exposed to wild coastal weather conditions, but its location on the Bangalley Headland is what truly makes it unique.<br /><br />#HouseTour #Architecture #Design<br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ Subscribe to Jonno: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Jonno-Rodd-YouTube">https://bit.ly/Jonno-Rodd-YouTube</a> <br />ðŸ‘‰ Subscribe to Lucy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Lucy-Glade-Wright-YouTube">http://bit.ly/Lucy-Glade-Wright-YouTube</a> <br /><br />Your go-to inspiration for Home, Design and Lifestyle.
