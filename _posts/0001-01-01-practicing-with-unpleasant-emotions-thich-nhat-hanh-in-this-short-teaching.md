{% raw %}In this short teaching video from the Deer Park Monastery (February, 2004), Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh (Thay) guides us on how to take care of emotions when they come up. Every time a painful feeling is born, we go home and take good care of our feelings with the practice of mindfulness. Mindfulness here is like a mother coming to hold and embrace the pain that is crying out to us. This is the practice of love: telling our painful emotions, &quot;Darling I know you suffer. That is why I am here for you.&quot; <br /><br />Thay teaches us four practical steps to help us:<br />1. Recognize our pain<br />2. Embrace the pain<br />3. Bring Relief<br />4. Touch Insight and transformation<br /><br />-------<br />To find out more about this process, check out Thay's book &quot;The Path of Emancipation&quot; ‚ûõ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.parallax.org/product/the-path-of-emancipation/">https://www.parallax.org/product/the-path-of-emancipation/</a><br /><br />-------<br />Find more similar short teachings on the FREE Plum Village app <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plumvillage.app/‚Äã">https://plumvillage.app/‚Äã</a> Enjoy! üôè<br /><br />You can help us caption and translate this video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amara.org/en/videos/zPKTK33J3t8u">https://amara.org/en/videos/zPKTK33J3t8u</a><br /><br />#ThichNhatHanh‚Äã #mindfulness‚Äã #PlumVillageApp{% endraw %}
