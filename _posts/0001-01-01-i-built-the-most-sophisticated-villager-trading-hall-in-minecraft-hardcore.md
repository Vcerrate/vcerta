{% raw %}*Clickbait Title: I Spent 100 Days (x2) Farming Infinite Emeralds To Build The PERFECT Villager Trading Hall.<br /><br />I Built the most beautiful villager trading hall to ever exist in hardcore minecraft. No tiny 1x1x2 cells alongside hideous hallways here, no sir! I went above and beyond to construct lavish rooms to house every type of villager in Minecraft. Was it necessary? No! But I did end up creating an efficient bee farm, and an incredibly busted stacking raid farm. Not sure what i'm supposed to do with all the little guys I got. I just really wish I had some extra obsidian.<br /><br />=======================================<br />Here are other creators who made this video possible!<br /><br />Ianxofour: (The Modern God of Simple Minecraft Farms)<br />    - His Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ianxofour">https://www.youtube.com/user/ianxofour</a><br />    -The Stacking Raid Farm: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3mOlrMGjUg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3mOlrMGjUg</a><br /><br />BBlocks: <br />   - The Laser Cutter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUfQmAQ7Olg&amp;t=578s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUfQmAQ7Olg&amp;t=578s</a><br /><br />Please Subscribe To These Amazing Creators They Deserve It Much More Than I Do!<br />=======================================<br /><br />*Litematica (By Masady) Download: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica</a><br />*invisible item frames (By IcebergLEttuce) Download: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/easy-invisible-item-frames-for-survival/">https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/easy-invisible-item-frames-for-survival/</a><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Finally taking my time to edit a full video instead of doing an unedited longplay (which I will still do as a way to take a day off to relax).
