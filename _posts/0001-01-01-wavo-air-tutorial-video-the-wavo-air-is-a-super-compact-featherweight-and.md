{% raw %}The Wavo AIR is a super compact, featherweight, and easy-to-use wireless microphone system for Mobile and Camera users that delivers tight, broadcast-quality sound for the latest killer content.​<br />The kit includes a wide selection of accessories, ranging from the classic belt clip to dedicated cold-shoe mount. You also get a magnetic pendant along with both TRS and TRRS cables.​<br />The clip-on transmitter has a built-in mic and it’s small and light enough to clip to a top or inside a t-shirt. A purpose built LAV mic is also supplied so you can clip it out of the way on a belt or jeans and only have the mic near your mouth.​<br />The Wavo AIR Kit sets the creator up with two wireless transmitters and two lavalier mics, so works great for interviews.<br /><br />*Available only in US/UK<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://joby.com/us-en/wavo-air-jb01737-bww/">https://joby.com/us-en/wavo-air-jb01737-bww/</a> <br /><br />Follow us on:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jobyinc/">https://www.instagram.com/jobyinc/</a> <br />Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/joby">https://www.youtube.com/joby</a> <br />Tik Tok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jobyinc">https://www.tiktok.com/@jobyinc</a><br />Official Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://joby.com/">http://joby.com/</a>{% endraw %}
