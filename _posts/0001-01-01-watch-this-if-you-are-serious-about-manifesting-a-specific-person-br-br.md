Neville Goddard teaches that nothing exists outside of your own consciousness, and your entire experience of the world is simply a projection of your internal consciousness. <br />This is why if you want to change your experience, you must start by changing the assumptions you hold about the world.<br /><br />𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜𝘀 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗱?<br /><br />The subconscious mind is the part of your brain that is not aware. It is the part which stores the information and data you provide it with. For example, when you brush your teeth, other thoughts can run through your conscious brain without you getting distracted. That’s because your subconscious mind has already been trained a certain pattern.<br />Your subconscious mind stores affirmations and enables you to manifest/attract what you believe in. It works without you even realizing! The best way to train your subconscious is awareness.<br />Awareness comes from reducing the flow of thoughts in our conscious mind and focusing on the subconscious part. It can be achieved by meditating and affirming. There are different methods of meditation and manifestation.<br />You attract what you think. You attract what you say. You attract what you fear.<br /><br />𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗧𝗼 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗱?<br /><br />Wondering how to reprogram your subconscious mind? Based on the research and studies that have surfaced in the last decade regarding neuroplasticity – the brain changes and shapes throughout our lifetime. This debunks the old notions that our brain is fixed at childhood and stays that way - instead we now know it’s malleable throughout life. Science is continuing to reveal that habits, our established ways of thinking, feeling, and doing, can be rewired by forming new neural pathways in the brain and weakening old ones. With consistency and repetition towards your desired change, you can completely rewire your brain and work towards changing your subconscious programming.<br />This extends itself to actions we choose, how we respond to the world, creativity, imagination, emotional health, and beliefs. Uncovering all the old subconscious programming and limiting beliefs we’ve picked up throughout our lifetime (from parents, trauma, society, media, your environment, etc.) and doing the work to dissolve them, while reprograming a new high self-worth belief system allows you to redesign your entire life. Because what you attract is based on your subconscious self-worth, you begin having an entirely new vision around what you deserve and are capable of manifesting. <br /><br />𝗚𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝘀 𝗙𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗧𝗮𝗽𝗲𝘀<br /><br />Self Pause<br />iOS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/selfpause-daily-affirmations/id1518538414">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/selfpause-daily-affirmations/id1518538414</a><br />Android: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.selfpause">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.selfpause</a><br /><br />Parrot<br />iOS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/parrot-recorder-and-looper/id1527210110">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/parrot-recorder-and-looper/id1527210110</a>{% endraw %}
