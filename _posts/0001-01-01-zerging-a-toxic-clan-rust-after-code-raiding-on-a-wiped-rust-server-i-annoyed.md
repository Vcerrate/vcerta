{% raw %}After code raiding on a wiped rust server, I annoyed a toxic clan by building twig and taking them on with just spears. After a few successful attempts I take the role of the repair man to annoy them further up until we called a small zerg onto their base.<br /><br />@Lucasbattle <br /><br />Second Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EnardoLIVE">https://www.youtube.com/c/EnardoLIVE</a><br />Shorts Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EnardoSHORTS">https://www.youtube.com/c/EnardoSHORTS</a><br />Rust Servers: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://enardoservers.com">https://enardoservers.com</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/enardo">https://discord.gg/enardo</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/enardo">https://www.twitch.tv/enardo</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@enardo">https://www.tiktok.com/@enardo</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Enardoz">https://twitter.com/Enardoz</a><br />Music By: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/enardo">http://share.epidemicsound.com/enardo</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Enardo">https://www.patreon.com/Enardo</a><br />Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://enardo.gg/">https://enardo.gg/</a><br /><br />The only aim in Rust is to survive. To do this you will need to overcome struggles such as hunger, thirst and cold. Build a fire. Build a shelter. Kill animals for meat. Protect yourself from other players, and kill them for meat. Create alliances with other players and form a town. Do whatever it takes to survive.<br /><br />Outro song: Osoku - Air Bed<br /><br />#Rust #PlayRust #zerg{% endraw %}
