{% raw %}Hey! So I’m still figuring out how to truly document the journey. As you can probably see the tour you got last week was done after some of the content in this video. <br />None the less I’m trying to catch everything and carry you along for even the decision making parts. <br /><br />So the vlog and footage is now fully up to date. Moving forward the footage is going to be current! <br /><br />If you haven’t seen the tour as yet check out my past vlogs. <br /><br />Comment any ideas or suggestions please. We welcome them all. <br /><br />I also created an Instagram page for it so you can keep up its @oldspanish_fort <br /><br />#buildinginjamaica #airbnb #buildingmyempire{% endraw %}
