{% raw %}I started my jungle journey by building shelters, where I found my freedom and most comfort. Hope you enjoy the video and thank you very much for watching and thanks to everyone that has been watching and supporting my channel.<br />My videos cover Bushcraft, camping, fishing, shelter, off grid, log cabin, asmr, diy, primitive technology, wilderness survival and outdoor skills, bushcraft gear like axes, etc.<br />I've opened a Patreon account in order to give you the option of helping the channel in whichever way suits you. Becoming a Patron would allow me to focus more on YouTube.<br />Donations will go into helping purchase equipment and clothes for my future bushcraft videos and hikes. Your support also will help me buy a new computer for video editing. It allows me to create higher quality content.<br />www.patreon.com/FreeFootsteps<br />ðŸ’š I'm so grateful for the support! You're Amazing! ðŸ’š<br />#logcabinâ€‹â€‹, #offgridâ€‹â€‹, #bushcraft{% endraw %}
