Chords like these can often seem somewhat intimidating if you've not been introduced to them as they come with a whole range of &quot;rules&quot; and conventions on how to play them. So hopefully today I can break down some of the mystery surrounding these lush, beautiful chords!<br /><br />And, an extra special thanks goes to Douglas Lind, Vidad Flowers, Ivan Pang, Waylon Fairbanks, Jon Dye, Austin Russell, Christopher Ryan, Toot &amp; Paul Peijzel, the channel’s Patreon saints! 😇<br /><br />SUPPORT ME ON PATREON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/davidbennettpiano🎹">https://www.patreon.com/davidbennettpiano🎹</a>{% endraw %}
