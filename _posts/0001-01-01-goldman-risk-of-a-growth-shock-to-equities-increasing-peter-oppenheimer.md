{% raw %}Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, discusses Federal Reserve policy and its implications for global stocks markets. Oppenheimer says equities tend to digest higher bond yields eventually during Fed hiking cycles as long as the growth/rates mix is favorable, but there is the risk that a &quot;rates shock&quot; triggers a &quot;growth shock,&quot; and that risk looks higher. He speaks from the sidelines of Goldman Sachs Global Macro Conference Asia on &quot;Bloomberg Daybreak: Australia.&quot;{% endraw %}
