TD is Canada’s second largest bank only behind RBC, and is also my personal favourite Canadian bank stock. But TD is also becoming a significant player in the US finance industry – especially through this recent acquisition. TD is also one of Canada's best dividend stocks that increased its dividend by 13% in Q4 2021. So is TD bank stock a buy in 2022?
