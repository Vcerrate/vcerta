{% raw %}Today I'm chatting about what I learned after getting rid of over 60% of my clothes. I used to rely on collecting clothing and constantly shopped to stay &quot;on trend&quot;, but realized that most of those trends weren't really for me at all. Nowadays I'm embracing a &quot;less is more&quot; philosophy when it comes to my wardrobe, and I've started to really figure out what my style is and what I no longer need to buy for my closet.<br /><br />What are some pieces of clothing you no longer buy? <br /><br />✨jewelry is always Mejuri <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mejurifinecrew.sjv.io/vnQvrL">https://mejurifinecrew.sjv.io/vnQvrL</a><br /><br />📸 Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/christina.mychas">https://www.instagram.com/christina.mychas</a><br />📱 TikTok <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2WaELlQ">https://bit.ly/2WaELlQ</a><br />🍃 My Website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.minimalist-ish.com/">https://www.minimalist-ish.com/</a><br />🛍 Low Buy Beauties Shopping Support Group <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2R3AHxC">http://bit.ly/2R3AHxC</a> <br />💸 The Budgeting App I Use <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/35SgX8G">https://bit.ly/35SgX8G</a><br />👗 FREE Wardrobe Tracking Spreadsheet <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3lPJ8eu">https://bit.ly/3lPJ8eu</a><br /><br />For business inquires, contact: sarah.smyth@platformmedia.ca<br /><br />Codes &amp; Discounts (if you want to)🤘🏻<br />✨MEJURI - save 10% with my link off your next Mejuri piece <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mejurifinecrew.sjv.io/vnQvrL">https://mejurifinecrew.sjv.io/vnQvrL</a><br />🍃ORGANIC BASICS - use code OBXSTYLE to save off 10% off your order<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3BahXSG">https://bit.ly/3BahXSG</a><br />👜SAMARA - cruelty-free minimalist bags &amp; accessories (female-owned, from Toronto)  get 10% off your first order with code CHRISTINA10 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3kHWibA">https://bit.ly/3kHWibA</a> <br />🍳OUR PLACE - use code CHRISTINAM10 to save 10% off your first purchase at Our Place <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ma7SRq">https://bit.ly/3ma7SRq</a><br />🌸 MINORI - cruelty-free minimalist makeup (female owned, from Montreal) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/3dmsl">https://shrsl.com/3dmsl</a> - save 20% using code CHRISTINA20 until Feb 20, 2022 (after that, use code CHRISTINA15 to save 15%!) <br /><br />My Filming Gear 📽<br />Main Camera <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3aCpbVo">https://amzn.to/3aCpbVo</a><br />Main Lens <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3aInSEn">https://amzn.to/3aInSEn</a><br />On-camera Mic <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3pBasOT">https://amzn.to/3pBasOT</a><br />Main Shotgun Mic <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3poZYSi">https://amzn.to/3poZYSi</a><br />Vlog Camera <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WMedEw">https://amzn.to/2WMedEw</a><br />Small Vlog Mic <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3aJ1lXS">https://amzn.to/3aJ1lXS</a><br />Main Light <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3rtj63t">https://amzn.to/3rtj63t</a><br />Main Softbox <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3rDyXN8">https://amzn.to/3rDyXN8</a><br />External Audio Recorder <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/34FPCpi">https://amzn.to/34FPCpi</a><br /><br />FTC: This video is not sponsored.
