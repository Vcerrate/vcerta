{% raw %}Field Day swaps seaboards to experience the Floridian twist on pro skateboarding life, as we spend dawn until dusk in the ever-charming company of the 2017 Thrasher Magazine's Skater Of The Year Jamie Foy.<br />Deerfield Beach is where we begin, starting with an education in the precise ritual behind the breakfast trinity of bacon, eggs and cheese. <br /><br />What anyone who spends time in Jamie’s company notices right away is just how much he loves where his skating life has taken him, in terms of being able to live where he was raised and make a living doing what he has always loved, right there. <br /><br />From his driveway set-up featuring the labour-intensive nice touch of beer can coping on the concrete quarters, to his appreciation of his first neighbourhood shop sponsor Island Water Sports, he is truly at home where he lives which is not something every pro skater can be able to say. In a sense that’s actually today’s pro skating dream for a lot of people.<br /><br />The perfect illustration of how he and lifelong friend Zion Wright, who rocks up to join us, have figured out how to balance their skating responsibilities with enjoying life right now is their ability to skip out into Florida’s Everglades for an afternoon’s bass fishing among the alligators (no, really)- before rolling into downtown Miami for a heated night session amidst the unbelievable humidity of the mighty Lot 11 Skatepark under the highway right in the heart of the city.<br /><br />To get an idea of just how humid it gets there, check out the sweat puddles at the foot of the handrail. It makes every landing even more treacherous.<br /><br />Lot 11 is such a superb park that the session is joined by none other than Stefan Janoski, to conclude what seems in any telling to be something close to anyone’s idea of a perfect skating day. <br />There’s nobody more deserving of that pro status in skating today than Jamie Foy.<br /><br />Enjoy our day in his life, and thanks for inviting us to hang out, Jamie!<br /><br />► Subscribe to the Red Bull Skateboarding on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://win.gs/RedBullSkateboarding">https://win.gs/RedBullSkateboarding</a><br /><br />Red Bull Skateboarding on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://win.gs/RedBullSkateboardingFacebook">https://win.gs/RedBullSkateboardingFacebook</a><br /><br />Red Bull Skateboarding on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://win.gs/RedBullSkateboardingInstagram">https://win.gs/RedBullSkateboardingInstagram</a><br /><br />Subscribe to the Red Bull Skateboarding on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://win.gs/RedBullSkateboarding">https://win.gs/RedBullSkateboarding</a><br /><br />Get the FREE Red Bull TV apps for all your devices: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://onelink.to/yfbct7">http://onelink.to/yfbct7</a><br /><br />Watch Red Bull TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://win.gs/WatchRBTV">http://win.gs/WatchRBTV</a><br /><br />#redbullskateboarding #florida #soty #fieldday{% endraw %}
