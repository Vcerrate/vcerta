{% raw %}Small changes to your beauty routine can help reduce some of the beauty waste in the cosmetics industry. Axiology is a clean, vegan, and cruelty-free makeup brand that creates zero-waste Lip-to-Lid Balmies. Switching to shampoo bars, like ones sold at Lush or Ethique, or trying products that come in dissolvable packaging can help reduce liquid and plastic waste. Other options include using powder shampoo, like one sold by Susteau. Traditional makeup wipes can be harmful to the environment and your skin, so using alternatives like multi-use sponges or cleansing balms can be a lot more eco-friendly.
