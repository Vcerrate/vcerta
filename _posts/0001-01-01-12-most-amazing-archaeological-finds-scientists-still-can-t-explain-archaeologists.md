{% raw %}Archaeologists and scientists often work together to solve the mysteries of a discovery. An archaeologist might be able to say roughly where and when an artefact or an object was made, but they can’t always say why or how it was made. In those circumstances, they’ll turn to a scientist for assistance. There are times when the scientists can’t help, though - and those are the times that allow us to make videos like this one!{% endraw %}
