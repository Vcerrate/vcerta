{% raw %}How are amphibians adapted to water and land?  How do they communicate to each other?  Join Cornell University Naturalist Outreach students for a lively tour of the remarkable diversity of amphibian adaptations. This is one of many naturalistoutreach science videos on YouTube that explore nature and biodiversity.  See <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://blogs.cornell.edu/naturalistoutreach">http://blogs.cornell.edu/naturalistoutreach</a> and NYS 4H Stem pages for guides and worksheets on amphibians, reptiles, and many other topics. This video is a co-production of Dr. Linda Rayor, the Ithaca College Park Media Lab, and NYS 4H.{% endraw %}
