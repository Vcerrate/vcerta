{% raw %}Proof by regular expression and Finite Automata for regular languages are closed under union, Concatenation, Kleene closure and Complement operation.<br />Examples of Complement for the following problems:<br />1. Design of DFA that will accept all string over {a, b} that is not having substring aa.<br />2. Design of DFA that will accept all string over {a, b} that perform complement of the language (start with a and end with b).{% endraw %}
