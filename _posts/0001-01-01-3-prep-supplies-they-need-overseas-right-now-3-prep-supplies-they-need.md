{% raw %}3 Prep Supplies They Need Overseas Right Now<br />According to the UALI, there are 3 main prepping items that survivors are asking for right now overseas. Do you have these categories covered?<br /><br />The UALI is a group out of Long Island that holds weekly supply drives to help their friends and family overseas survive what is happening right now. The main groups of items that are being requested include: Medical/First Aid, Body Armor and Work/Combat Boots. Amazingly, you'll find that many people do not have very much in regards to some of these items and in some cases don't have any. Especially the boots. We can learn from what others are experiencing during these times of emergency in order to better our own preparedness. Are you covered when it comes to these 3 categories?<br /><br />If you need to boost you Medical/First Aid prepping inventory, especially in order to sustain long term wound care, then check out <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.refugemedical.com/">https://www.refugemedical.com/</a>   Their Wound Care Bucket is a huge addition to any first aid supply and their Adventure Kit 2.0 is a do-all solution to any excursion. Use the code &quot;MAGIC&quot; for 10% off any order. I do not receive commissions from Refuge Medical, I just support their company and appreciate what they offer the preparedness community.<br /><br />If you are looking for high quality body armor or are new to body armor in general, check out MIRA Safety's MT-LVL4 body armor plates which can stop anything up to armor piercing 30-06!

There are many great brands and many options so do your research but the companies I listed have been quality for my personal use and have good reputations.<br /><br />For more information on SHTF Prepping, please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.MagicPrepper.com">https://www.MagicPrepper.com</a><br /><br />#Preps #Prepping #SHTF{% endraw %}
