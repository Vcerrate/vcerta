{% raw %}Things aren't looking great for former President Donald Trump in Georgia.  Discussing Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Trump says: &quot;Say what you want, but Judge Jackson was unbelievably disrespectful to Republican Senators that in many cases were really nicely asking questions. She had total disdain and even hatred for them.&quot; Trump eventually has to make KBJ all about him in order to get a reaction out of his low-energy MAGA crowd. Sam Seder and the MR crew discuss this. <br /><br />We stream our live show every day at 12 PM ET.<br /><br /><br /><br />We need your help to keep providing free videos!
