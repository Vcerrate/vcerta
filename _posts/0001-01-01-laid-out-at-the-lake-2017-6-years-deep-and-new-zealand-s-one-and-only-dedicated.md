{% raw %}6 years deep and New Zealand’s one and only dedicated minitruck and customs show just keeps on growing. With over 120 vehicles at this year’s show, participants now annually make the journey all<br />the way from the other end of the country to Taupo, New Zealand – with some visitors coming all the way from Australia too. This truly is the highlight of the year for most of the country’s truckers<br />and debuts of fresh builds are becoming one of the highlights. Come check out some of these rides, and take the passenger’s seat for the cruise to the show with the WTF (Wellington Trucking Friends) minitruck club.<br /><br />Dates are already set for the 2018 show so check out www.facebook.com/LOATL12 for more details, and make sure you keep up with WTF at www.facebook.com/WellingtonTruckingFriends.<br /><br />Filmed and edited by Alex Brimmicombe<br />Additional footage by Ollie Fairclough, Liam Gains, &amp; Sam Pou.<br /><br />Music in order of appearance:<br />“Fall Apart” by KRANE &amp; Alexander Lewis<br />“Deluge” by Kareful<br />“Strange Times” by The Black Keys{% endraw %}
