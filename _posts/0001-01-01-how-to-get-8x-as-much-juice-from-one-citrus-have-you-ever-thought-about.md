{% raw %}Have you ever thought about how to get more juice from one citrus? Using citrus is a must for a number of cocktails, but is it really necessary to use one whole citrus for only one cocktail and then throw it away? It’s on us to think more environmentally friendly and try to be sustainable with our hobby/passion/profession. But when it’s also cheaper it’s easier to get the boss on board as well - there’s a method that can get you up to 8 times more juice from each citrus, the juice has a longer shelf life and a more prominent citrus flavor in a cocktail - those are wins all around, right? This is possible thanks to Super Juice - the brainchild of Nickle Morris, a bartender, and owner of Expo Cocktail Bar, in Louisville, Kentucky.<br />I studied his technique, combined it with Dave Arnold’s formula for acids, and implemented it into my way of making ingredients. Our recipes may be a bit different but I kept the environmentally- and wallet-friendly approach. And so can you! Are you ready for Super Juice?!<br /> <br />Get awesome Cocktail Time MERCH here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://my-store-11171765.creator-spring.com">https://my-store-11171765.creator-spring.com</a> <br /><br />By buying through the affiliate links you’re also helping out the Cocktail Time channel with a small commission (at no additional cost to you).

See formula above. Shake well and leave it for up to two hours. This will give you “oleo citrate” which will give our juice acidity and citrus flavor.<br />Then place everything from the jar (including the peels) into a blender and add water (again see formula above). Make sure to rinse inside of a jar with water to get out all the oleo citrate. Juice the lime / lemon / orange and add the juice into the blender as well. Blend for half a minute then strain through a cheesecloth. Bottle the Super Juice, keep in the fridge and use within a week. <br /><br />Check out our previous episode, with a zero-waste cocktail with a macaron garnish, here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/pLiFvR5Cn5U">https://youtu.be/pLiFvR5Cn5U</a> <br /><br />Check out the @PortlandCocktailWeek episode with Nickle Morris: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/OBY0aJiupbE">https://youtu.be/OBY0aJiupbE</a> <br /><br />Read the Punch.com article here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://punchdrink.com/articles/super-juice-lime-daiquiri-recipe/">https://punchdrink.com/articles/super-juice-lime-daiquiri-recipe/</a> <br /><br />Here are some of my favorite YouTube cocktail channels:<br />@How To Drink <br />@Steve the Bartender <br />@Truffles On The Rocks <br />@The Educated Barfly <br />@Vlad SlickBartender <br />@Be Hide <br />@Anders Erickson <br />  <br />0:00 Why do we need Super Juice?<br />2:08 Gear and ingredients<br />2:57 Making Oleo Citrate<br />5:13 Making Super Juice<br />6:32 Recap and Super Daiquiri<br /><br />The team behind this video:<br />Robi Fišer<br />Sašo Veber<br />Phantom hand<br /> <br />#cocktailtime #sustainability #superjuice{% endraw %}
