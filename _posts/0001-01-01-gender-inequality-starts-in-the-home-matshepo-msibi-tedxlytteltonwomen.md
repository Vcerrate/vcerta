{% raw %}This talk is my childhood story of how gender inequality shows up in the home and how systematic and culturally entrenched it is. I share that if we don't all start to intentionally dismantle it in the home then we are fighting a losing battle in the workplace, and will never achieve equality in our lifetime.  Matshepo Msibi is the Executive Director at Moloko-Grace Advisory, a consultancy and Advisory firm that implements programmes in Strategy, Affirmative Procurement, Enterprise Development, Financial Inclusion, Programme Management and Women Economic Empowerment (Sexual harassment and Gender Based Violence) with a special focus on women and youth. She is  a consultant for UN Women and the Presidency in South Africa working on a project to empower women owned businesses (victims of GBVF) to participate in public procurement opportunities. She was the National Consultant for the International Trade Centre (ITC) working on the SheTrades Outlook platform that aims to connect 3 million women entrepreneurs to international markets.<br /> <br />She was the Executive Director for the Businesswomenâ€™s Association of SA, and has considerable invaluable executive and senior management experience across sectors. She has numerous post graduate qualifications in Leadership, Transformation and Project Management. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
