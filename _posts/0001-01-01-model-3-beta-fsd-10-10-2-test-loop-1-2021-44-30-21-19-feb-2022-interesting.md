{% raw %}Interesting to see some changes in how beta FSD is handling this test loop with this update. <br /><br />Some improvements related to the navigation map updates which is awesome to see. Speed limit improvements and an issue with a slow down with a false intersection are now fixed.  <br /><br />The biggest change I noticed this time around is the car being a little less aggressive accelerating with controlled turns and being more casual in its entry to some turn lanes. <br /><br />Overall a good drive that didn’t require any steering interventions but I did need to tap the accelerator a few times to encourage the car to move a little faster in spots. But that’s due to my own concern about holding up someone behind me as the car wants to do something a little slower than I would.{% endraw %}
