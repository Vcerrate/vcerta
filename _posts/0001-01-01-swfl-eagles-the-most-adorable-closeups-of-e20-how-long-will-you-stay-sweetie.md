{% raw %}E20 has surprised us all by choosing to stay at the nest tree and pasture pond this long instead of flying off to start his travels and solo journey like E19 has done. E20 is such a character at 131 days old! He loves to hang out on the leaning palm tree and swoop the pond scattering the waterfowl with each pass and fishing attempt. E20 has been the first juvie we have seen on cam catch a fish in the pond and now makes fishing a daily endeavor! E20 loves to hang out in the nest tree &amp; surrounding snags - always keeping an eye out for Mom or Dad with a potential delivery! E20 loves to do some bottom dipping at the pond and has never spent a night away from Mom and Dad and the nest tree. E20 has learned many survival skills and continues to hone his fishing and hunting techniques so he may be able to thrive once out on his own. <br /><br />We just never know when E20 will choose to depart and each day could be the last, so enjoy some beautiful up close and personal coverage of this magnificent young eagle! Thank you for watching!<br /><br />Video captured &amp; edited by Lady Hawk <br /><br />Thank you SWFEC , hosted by Dick Pritchett Real Estate, for allowing us the opportunity to view these amazing eagles.<br /><br />Watch live: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dickpritchettrealestate.com/eaglecam360.html">https://dickpritchettrealestate.com/eaglecam360.html</a>{% endraw %}
