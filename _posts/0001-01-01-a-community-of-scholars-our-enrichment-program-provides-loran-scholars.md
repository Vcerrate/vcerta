{% raw %}Our enrichment program provides Loran Scholars with much more than financial support.<br /><br />Each scholar is paired with a community or business leader who acts as their mentor, advisor and role model. Between academic terms, the scholars pursue three summer internships in different sectors and cultural settings.<br />Incoming scholars participate in an outdoor expedition, which challenges them physically and builds a shared sense of identity before they disperse across Canada to begin their first term at university. Following the expedition, they join all current scholars at a four-day retreat for peer-to-peer learning, leadership sessions, and reflection.{% endraw %}
