Self-motivation is often a problematic victim of vague, wimpy goals; lack of sufficient visualization; or failing to reinforce the ratchets in your achievement. <br /><br />If you're constantly struggling to stay motivated, it may be that you have the wrong goals, or your life has the wrong purpose. If you're trying to motivate yourself to accomplish things that don't embrace your passion, you'll never get far. If you're passionless about where you're headed, you need to pick a new direction. Examine your higher self and what your true, passionate life purpose really is. <br /><br />Once your direction is aligned with your life purpose, visualize your vivid, specific, and ambitious goals for your life -- the bigger the better. You need a detailed map before you can get anywhere. Picture your vision in your mind and on paper to make it more real. <br /><br />Now build your vision deep into your daily life. Review it daily, post it prominently, journal about it, check in with a mentor daily -- whatever it takes to keep you focused on your vision.{% endraw %}
