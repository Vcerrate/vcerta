{% raw %}Jim Chanos founded Kynikos Associates in 1985, which manages a short-only and a hedged portfolio. While it's been a difficult decade for short-sellers, Chanos says since September 2021, investors have been slowly waking up to misleading and fraudulent practices among some of the world's most famous companies. <br /><br />Chanos rose to fame after correctly predicting the fall of the energy and commodities giant Enron Corporation, a year before the accounting scandal was publicised and the firm filed for bankruptcy in 2001. At the time, it was considered to be the biggest bankruptcy and audit failure in the world. <br /><br />So which companies could be misleading investors today? In this exclusive Livewire interview, you'll get an inside look at the legendary short seller's view on markets, as well as some of the global companies that Chanos considers to be posting fraudulent financial figures and could be in for a rude awakening over the months to come. <br /><br />Note: This interview took place on Friday 11th of March 2022. You can read a transcript that has been edited for clarity below. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/the-companies-that-wall-street-legend-jim-chanos-is-shorting-in-2022">https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/the-companies-that-wall-street-legend-jim-chanos-is-shorting-in-2022</a>{% endraw %}
