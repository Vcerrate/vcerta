{% raw %}Today we take a look around LEVC - Head Office, Li Close, Ansty Park, Coventry CV7 9RF.<br /><br />We have a good look into the windows at the production line and have a nice wonder around the car park where we see the VN5 and TX models up close with lots of sign written versions.<br /><br />We then take the drone up and get approached by a few staff.<br /><br />The drone footage shows how many vehicles they have in stock and also finds the hidden prototype future vehicles in the back corner.<br /><br />I don't think they should keep future secrets out in the open like that!<br /><br />Enjoy!<br />_________________________________<br />Q - What is your email address?<br />A - djaudits@gmail.com<br /><br />Q - What Drone Do I Use<br />A - DJI MINI 2 <br />Can be purchased here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ICW9Dp">https://amzn.to/3ICW9Dp</a><br /><br />Q - What Camera Do I Use<br />A - DJI OSMO POCKET 2<br />Can be purchased here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/30bEMs4">https://amzn.to/30bEMs4</a>{% endraw %}
