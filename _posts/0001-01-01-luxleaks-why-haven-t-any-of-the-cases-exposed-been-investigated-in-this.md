{% raw %}In this Taxcast Extra from the Tax Justice Network: Why has the European Commission failed to take a case using the LuxLeaks files which exposed Luxembourg's secret tax authority deals with multi-national companies? Could it be because the European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker used to be the Prime Minister of Luxembourg and chief architect of Luxembourg's tax haven business model? Will the Commission investigate the LuxLeaks cases before his term is up? Naomi Fowler speaks to the Tax Justice Network's John Christensen and Simon Bowers of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
