{% raw %}Why you may have been ghosted after 2 dates so you can avoid the same mistakes in the future.<br /><br />In this video coaching newsletter I discuss an email from a viewer who has been following my work for about 4 years and has read 3% Man, 9 times. Recently after a second date that ended with sex, but some foot in mouth moments, he got ghosted when he tried to set up a third date. He asks my opinion on what led to him getting ghosted.<br /><br />Click the link below to read the article “Ghosted After 2 Good Dates?” on my website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://understandingrelationships.com/ghosted-after-2-good-dates/72379">https://understandingrelationships.com/ghosted-after-2-good-dates/72379</a><br /><br />If you have not read my book, “How To Be A 3% Man” yet, that would be a good starting place for you.
