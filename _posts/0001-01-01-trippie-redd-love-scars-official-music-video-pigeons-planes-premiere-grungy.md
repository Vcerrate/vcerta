{% raw %}Grungy, melodic, and innovative, Trippie Redd is becoming rap’s newest rock star. He's got cosigns from Ugly God, Playboi Carti, and XXXTENTACION, plus a freshly penned deal with Strainge Entertainment, the LA-based label headed by Elliot Grainge. Trippie’s rising quickly, and for good reason. His latest project ‘A Love Letter to You’ is one-half love songs and one-half upbeat anthems, and it showcases the young Ohio native’s contrasting perspectives and impressive versatility. With nearly two million SoundCloud plays, “Love Scars” is Trippie Redd’s biggest song to date, and one of our personal favorites.<br /><br />Directed by: Peter Chen<br />Produced by: Mikko Kuokka<br /><br />Listen to Trippie Redd’s full ‘A Love Letter To You’ project here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/trippie-hippie-2/sets/a-love-letter-to-you">https://soundcloud.com/trippie-hippie-2/sets/a-love-letter-to-you</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Pigeons &amp; Planes on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/lylYiS">http://goo.gl/lylYiS</a><br />Check out more of Pigeons &amp; Planes here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://pigeonsandplanes.com/">http://pigeonsandplanes.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PigsAndPlans">https://twitter.com/PigsAndPlans</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PigsAndPlans">https://www.facebook.com/PigsAndPlans</a><br /><br />Pigeons &amp; Planes videos dig deeper into the music and news that matters.
