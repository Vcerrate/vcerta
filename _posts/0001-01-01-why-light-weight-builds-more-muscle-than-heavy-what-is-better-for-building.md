{% raw %}üí™üèºWhat is better for building muscle, light weights vs heavy weights? The shocking truth is that lifting too heavy can actually sabotage your gains. The best rep range to get stronger is 5 reps or less, but the ideal rep range to build muscle is somewhere between 8-12. <br /><br />The punchline is that its great to lift both heavy weights and light weights, but if all your sets you are ego lifting way too much weight you are killing your gains. I personally like to mix in my sets with some 8-12 reps and also some 2-5 rep sets to maximize my strength. I believe this is the best of both worlds. In theory light weights actually build more muscle than heavy weights, assuming you are close to failure in the 8-12 rep range. <br /><br />‚û¢Build muscle faster with Alpha Lion! www.AlphaLion.com (Code: Troy20)<br />‚û¢Free SuperHuman Protein w. every order! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Superhuman-you">https://bit.ly/Superhuman-you</a> (Code: Troy20)<br />‚û¢Share this video! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SpedmyS7xkY">https://youtu.be/SpedmyS7xkY</a><br />‚û¢Charles Glass Leg Workout! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8yL9c1iQ18&amp;t=3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8yL9c1iQ18&amp;t=3s</a><br /><br />‚û¢About Troy Adashun: Co-Founder of Alpha Lion &amp; content creator. <br />‚û¢ Instagram @Troy.Adashun <br />‚û¢ TikTok @TroyAdashun <br />‚û¢ Business: Troy@AlphaLion.com<br /><br />#lightweight #heavyweight #bodybuilding{% endraw %}
