{% raw %}EP5<br /><br />You will be watching village routine life with our Tamil Traditions,<br /><br />We filmed a day of our routine from morning to noon (Breakfast &amp; Lunch) so Valar made kali koozh for our breakfast but I asked for side dish so she got some fresh raddish from our farm to make raddish fry then she planned to make sambar with raddish for noon and surprisingly she made spinach poriyal with raddish leaves, I thought the raddish itself have some bitterness so the leaves might have more bitterness but she made tasty spinach poriyal by adding some of her secret ingredients  with it and in the noon we had our lunch together which feels awesome as usual so hope you all enjoyed..<br /><br />üå±Also we plant a tree in this video on behalf of you ‚ÄúFor us and for our earth against Global Warming‚Äù, In upcoming videos we will be planting trees regularly and just imagine these tress are belongs to youüå±<br /><br />The Traditional Life, Is Happy to share that we are creating ‚ÄúAn Organic Food Forest‚Äù, As a symbol of  Your Love &amp; Support..<br /><br />Life Of Raddish || Our Breakfast &amp; Lunch || Village Style Traditional Cooking | The Traditional Life<br /><br />To Watch More Of Our Videos, Click Below..<br />Chicken F<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="ryhttps://youtu.be/xjDWNH2G1Hs">ryhttps://youtu.be/xjDWNH2G1Hs</a><br /><br />Tasty Mutton Curry - ASMR<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/PrzB97YXSIU">https://youtu.be/PrzB97YXSIU</a><br /><br />OIL BRINJAL CURRY<br /><br /><br />KALI WITH DRUMSTICK LEAF SAMBAR<br /><br /><br /><br />Follow us on<br />Youtube:- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvaMpohMIVypvEWBEOHo1wA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvaMpohMIVypvEWBEOHo1wA</a><br /><br />Glad to say that we are Inspired from ÊùéÂ≠êÊüí Liziqi, Dianxi Xiaoge, Traditional Me, Poorna - The nature girl<br /><br />Contact Mail ID:- thetraditionalife@gmail.com #TheTraditionalLife #RaddishRecipes #FarmFresh{% endraw %}
