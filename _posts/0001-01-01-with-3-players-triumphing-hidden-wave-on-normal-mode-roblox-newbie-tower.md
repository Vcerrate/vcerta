{% raw %}I found out about this new game about 2 weeks ago and I decided to try and beat hidden wave with just 3 people. I thought it was impossible, but it turns out that it is easier than I imagined! Activating hidden wave is very easy, just leave 2 Miners at the end of the round. Beating it, however, is a bit difficult, especially the enemy spam in the beginning. Once you pass that, you have already won since the bosses are really easy compared to the enemy spam. This was really fun to play, but it's pretty hard for new players. Thanks to Leeelooo and Speedy for helping me accomplish this!
