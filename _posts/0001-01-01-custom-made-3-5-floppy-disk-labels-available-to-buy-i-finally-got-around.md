{% raw %}I finally got around to making these floppy disk labels in Photoshop.<br />This is something I have wanted to do for a very long time now, as my own were very untidy and tatty. Now they look nice and clean!<br />I made them look as close to the original style that was available to me as a kid.<br />Here I show what they look like on some floppies. :)<br /><br />Available to buy from Etsy:<br />etsy.com/uk/shop/WayneAshworthArt{% endraw %}
