These ingredients can be put to use for washing every area of the home.<br /><br />Lavender Vinegar - Place your Lavender buds (Fresh or dried) into a jar and cover with white distilled vinegar.  Leave to infuse for 4-6 weeks and then strain.  Discard the Lavender to the compost heap and use the Lavender Vinegar for washing mirrors and windows, to clean shower doors and for adding to laundry or to any washing water.<br /><br />Bath and Sanitary Ware cleaner - Half fill a small tub with Bicarbonate of Soda.  Add a good squirt of lemon juice and mix well.  Add  a capful of vinegar and stir well.  The mixture fizzes and foams as the chemicals in the lemon juice, vinegar and bicarbonate of soda react together.  Then add a squirt of Dr. Bronners and mix until you have a thick cream cleaning lotion.  Use a small amount on a damp cloth to clean the bath and basin.  This can also be used on any enamel ware or on kitchen sinks.  Removes dirt, grime and grease.<br /><br />I also use the Washing Grains in my laundry, for cleaning drains and for washing wood work and floors.<br /><br />Thank you for watching and please leave a comment.  What do you use as a natural cleaning agent?{% endraw %}
