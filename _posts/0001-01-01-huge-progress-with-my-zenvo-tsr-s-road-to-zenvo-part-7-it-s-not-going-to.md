{% raw %}It's not going to be long now until my Zenvo TSR-S is complete! Let's take a look on the assembly line at Zenvo's HQ and have a full progress update, especially now the engine and gearbox have been installed, and the interior parts are ready too. I cannot wait!<br /><br />For Part 7 of the Road to Zenvo series, we're back in Præstø, Denmark at Zenvo's home to see my car a month or two after the last update, when the chassis had arrived in the assembly hall. This time around there is a lot of progress to see; from the mechanical developments to the interior trim and elements to discover.<br /><br />After a quick walkaround to see the car with most panels installed, we're joined by Christian Brandt, Head of Design, for a full update on the interior components and a dive into the techniques required for some of the specific styles used. To then explore more of the mechanical side, Tobias from the Engineering Team explains both the new style of throttle bodies used, plus the carbon brake shields.<br /><br />It's getting very, very real now, but there will still be more updates to come before we are at the final, completed stage!<br /><br />Thanks for watching, Tim<br /><br />Chapters:<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:57 My Zenvo on the Line<br />04:33 Design Update<br />09:20 Interior Parts<br />10:58 Dashboard<br />14:14 Engine Inlet Manifold<br />16:17 Carbon Brake Heat Shields<br />18:35 Final Look at the Upgrades<br />19:45 Wrap Up<br /><br />#Zenvo #NewCar #RoadtoZenvo<br /><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT">http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT</a><br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.shmee150.com">http://www.shmee150.com</a><br /><br />Shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shop.shmee150.com">http://shop.shmee150.com</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/shmee150">http://www.instagram.com/shmee150</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/shmee150">http://www.facebook.com/shmee150</a>{% endraw %}
