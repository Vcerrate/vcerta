{% raw %}After 18 months of combined dry and ocean testing of the C3 Wave Energy Converter (WEC), CorPower and project partners have taken important steps towards proving commercial viability of wave energy. By verifying the ability to solve the two major challenges for wave energy, storm survivability combined with significant power production, a major demonstration milestone has been completed. <br /><br />- A novel storm protection mode that makes the device largely transparent to incoming waves was proven effective in minimizing motion and loads, providing robust operation in storm conditions. This new function for WECs can be compared to wind turbines that pitch the blades to minimize storm loading, a function found in essentially all commercial wind turbines of today.   <br /><br />- A novel phase control technology called WaveSpring, that delivered the projected amplification of motion and power capture performance in operational sea states, enabling a threefold increase in average power capture for a given buoy size. The measured power production with C3 in the ocean was consistent with the expectations from simulation models and prior dry testing with simulated waves. <br /><br />As part of the project, the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) issued a “Performance Statement” verifying measured performance.<br /><br />Video Credit: Bengt Melin{% endraw %}
