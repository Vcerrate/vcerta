Other sovereign nations are frantically &quot;coming up with something to compete with the U.S. dollar&quot; due to economic sanctions being ramped up in recent years, Rogers asserts. &quot;I cannot see the world having 100% computer money,&quot; he concludes, saying governments will use it to control the masses.<br /><br />Join Daniela Cambone's exclusive community ➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://danielacambone.com">https://danielacambone.com</a><br /><br />➡️  Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/StansberryResearch">https://www.facebook.com/StansberryResearch</a> <br />➡️  Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/stansberry">https://twitter.com/stansberry</a> <br />➡️  Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/stansberry_research">https://www.instagram.com/stansberry_research</a><br />➡️  Follow us on LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/stanberry-research">https://www.linkedin.com/company/stanberry-research</a>{% endraw %}
