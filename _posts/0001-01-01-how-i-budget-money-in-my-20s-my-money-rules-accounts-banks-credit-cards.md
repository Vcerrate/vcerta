In this video, we'll dive deeper into my Cashflow System to give you guys a better understanding of how I manage my cash. I'll be sharing the four money rules that guide me in managing my finances, then I'll show you the simple budgeting system I follow as a college student. I also have A LOT of accounts because I like to experiment, so I'll talk about my bank accounts, digital banks, e-wallets, and credit cards as well! <br /><br />Personal finance doesn't need to be complicated. When it comes to learning how to manage your money, it's important to find the system that works for you. This is what works for me and I'm hoping that you'll learn something from this video.
