Oh, oh <br />Would I take off? Oh, oh <br />Soar above the forest and the ocean blue <br />Sail to the very corners of the earth with you <br />It could be paradise, paradise <br />But only if you want it to <br /><br />We're breaking our hearts to the radio <br />When it gets too loud to sleep <br />And painting on smiles any way we know <br />But they're melting in the heat <br />And all along, the feeling's wrong <br />The taste is bittersweet <br />But it's not over, it's never over <br />It doesn't have to be <br /><br />So take me back to the ocean <br />Where the sea meets the open sky <br />Darling this could be paradise, paradise <br />Stay with me one more night <br />Lose yourself in slow motion <br />Take a hit, 'cos we need that high <br />Darling this could be paradise, paradise <br />Stay with me one more night <br /><br />---<br /><br />Stay in touch!<br />Instagram - @isaacandersonmusic<br />Twitter - @isaacandersonuk<br />Facebook - facebook.com/isaacandersonmusic <br />TikTok - @isaacandersonuk<br /><br />#IsaacAnderson​​​​ #ThisCouldBeParadise<br /><br />© Isaac Anderson 2022{% endraw %}
