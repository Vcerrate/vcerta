{% raw %}These life lessons have became something of urban legend since being written by Regina Brett. She wrote them in a blog post on the night before her 45th birthday after being diagnosed with breast cancer.  The lessons quickly became a viral hit on the internet with one article sharing them along with a picture of an elderly woman. Soon after, articles started appearing saying they written by a 90 year old. The idea caught on and the rest was history. <br /><br />The nature of these lessons gives the feel as though they written by someone who has lived a long life. While the author isn't 90 many of us can only imagine the shift in perspective one might have after receiving such a serious diagnosis. Regina is now in her 60s, a successful author and inspirational speaker. <br /><br />The lessons remind us of what's important, to not take life too seriously and to go after what you love. We must extract all we can from each day and show the people close to us that we love them because life is too short to live any other way.  <br /><br />James <br /><br />P.S. <br />I would like to thank Shane Morris for doing a perfect narration of these life lessons. <br /><br />Music Licensed through Artlist <br /><br />Image Licensed through Shutterstock{% endraw %}
