{% raw %}This had never been done before.<br /><br />A toddler diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy was enrolled in a stem cell clinical trial initiated by Dr Joshua Hare at Longeveron Inc University of Miami to help recover his heart.<br /><br />The family flew with their toddler to the famed Dr. Sunjay Kaushal, MD, PhD at Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago for the infusion. Once there, the doctors realized his heart was failing and they had to place him on a Berlin Heart Inc    to save his life. They implanted the device and told the family the child would need a heart transplant to survive.<br /><br />The most dedicated Rivka Sprei BSN-RN, working with Chaim Medical Resource, found the best pediatric cardiac surgeon in the nation - legendary Dr. Iki Adachi, MD      at Texas Children's Hospital. Dr Iki Adachi, MD  has trained hundreds of pediatric cardiac surgeons across the globe and was the only one able to explant the Berlin Heart Inc - avoiding transplant.<br /><br />To get this toddler from Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago to Texas Children's Hospital would require a massive effort.<br /><br />So they called VitalOneÂ® 1-855-MedEvac    <br /><br />We put together a team of rockstar pediatric specialists to provide the highest level of pediatric care. Logistically, this was a challenge, as we needed a backup Berlin Heart Inc as well as a hand pump specifically designed for the Berlin Heart Inc as CPR is ineffective.<br /><br />There was another challenge as well - the risk of membrane rupture at high altitude. Team leader Yanki (Jacob) Fekete instructed the pilots to fly at sea level cabin pressurization in order to eliminate this risk.<br /><br />Thankfully, the transport was a success.<br /><br />A few days after the toddler arrived, the explant surgery was performed and it was successful.<br /><br />Special thanks to Bob Kroslowitz CEO of Berlin Heart Inc, Kevin Tabamo Fischer        <br />and David Fishman.<br /><br />An extra special thanks to Yanki (Jacob) Fekete for superior aeromedical care and coordinating this mission.<br /><br />Great thanks to Mark Wallace, CEO of Texas Children's Hospital, for his support throughout this mission.<br />Shouout to @ari chaimovits PR productions for producing this one in a million video<br /><br />#vitalone #justonecall #bedtobed{% endraw %}
