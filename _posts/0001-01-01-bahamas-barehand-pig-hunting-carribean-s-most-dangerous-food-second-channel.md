PLEASANT FISHING VILLAGE<br />ADDRESS: Cargill Creek, Andros<br />INTERVIEWEE: Chef Emerson<br />🇧🇸WILD BOAR: Bring the herbs, spices and the vegetables to a boil in a medium-sized saucepan and cook for about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Strain, reserving the bay leaf, thyme, peppercorns and cloves, and discarding the vegetables. Pat meat dry and place it in a shallow dish. Pour the cooled marinade over it, return it to the refrigerator, loosely covered, and let it marinate. Remove the wild boar from the marinade and pat it dry. Make 20 tiny slits in it all over, and insert a clove into each slit. Transfer the boar to a baking dish, and pour one-fourth of the marinade over it. Roast until the boar is very golden on the outside.<br />🇧🇸WILD BOAR SOUP - Make with onions, carrots and irish potatoes, boiled in a homemade broth of water and seasonings, salt, pepper, lime, bay leaf.<br />🇧🇸SAUTEED LIVER - Make with carrots, liver, peppercorns, vinegar, onions, sweet pepper, garlic and oil.<br />PRICE: $300.00 USD per boar<br />#BestEverBahamasTour #BestEverFoodReviewShow<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />💬COME SAY HI:<br />INSTAGRAM » <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BestEverInstagram">http://bit.ly/BestEverInstagram</a> (@besteverfoodreviewshow)<br />FACEBOOK » <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook">http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook</a><br /> <br />💗SUPPORT OUR MISSION:<br />Patreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

I’m from the US but I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer.<br /> <br />If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />🎬 CREDITS:<br />HOST » Sonny Side<br />DP » Tony Sylvers<br />CAMERA OPERATOR » Dylan Johnson<br />PA » Jaison Merrick<br />VIDEO EDITOR » Lê Anh Đỗ<br />COLOR &amp; MASTER » Quí Nguyễn<br />PRODUCER » Liz Peterson<br />PRODUCTION COORDINATOR » Khoi Chung<br />LOCAL PRODUCER » Megan Minus<br />LOCAL PRODUCTION COORDINATOR » Rakia Rolle<br /> <br />Selected tracks via Audio Network<br />For business inquiries: marketing@befrs.com{% endraw %}
