{% raw %}What do you do when it snows in May and you have a vertebrae or rib that hurts in your back? Yoga, of course! This short flow focuses on upper back mobility (since that is where I had problems) and on warming the body up. Combine it with the video posted yesterday with class intro, and a while in savasana at the end.{% endraw %}
