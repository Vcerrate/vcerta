Jackson Wang<br /><br />I know if I just disappear I could do what I want<br />Go out every night I’d wake with no demons left, silence my head oh<br />There’s no scars that I’d need to heal through, no regrets with no one to pass to<br />I can’t even lie, I can’t even lie<br /><br />It’d probably be a little easier<br />It’d probably be a little easier<br /><br /><br />But why the hell would I want to, want to<br />Ever try to live without you, out you<br />Trying to take it all away, but I’m only gonna stay<br />So why the hell would I want to, want to<br />Ever try to live without you, out you<br />Why they got me so afraid, but I know I gotta stay, mmm<br /><br />The voices they keep me on overdrive<br />I’m hanging my head, my chin up high<br />Can’t even see through all the tears I mask<br />I know I’ve gone this far, ain’t going back<br /><br /><br />I’m in this new sh*t, independent<br />Don’t care how even spend it, be like magic<br />And even when the lights on, I’m under pressure<br />I won’t last forever no<br /><br /><br />It’d probably be a little easier<br />It’d probably be a little easier<br /><br /><br />But why the hell would I want to, want to<br />Ever try to live without you, out you<br />Trying to take it all away, but I’m only gonna stay<br />So why the hell would I want to, want to<br />Ever try to live without you, out you<br />Why they got me so afraid, but I know I gotta stay, mmm<br /><br /><br />I tried to leave without looking<br />Left it all behind me<br />But my heart kept asking me if I wanted it back, you know<br />Walking on the lane but my heart is running on a different track<br />Thought I could move on<br />But the memories piling in stacks<br /><br /><br /><br />Probably be a little easier<br /><br />It’d probably be a little easier<br /><br /><br /><br />But why the hell would I want to, want to<br /><br />Ever try to live without you, out you<br /><br />Trying to take it all away, but I’m only gonna stay<br /><br />So why the hell would I want to, want to<br /><br />Ever try to live without you, out you<br /><br />Why they got me so afraid, but I know I gotta stay, mmm{% endraw %}
