This sounds like a hobby right up James' street, he's driven worse things before after all.<br />» SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ1Sc5xjWpUnp_o_lUTkvgQ?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ1Sc5xjWpUnp_o_lUTkvgQ?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Watch Full Episodes Now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/detail/B086VXVYCY">https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/detail/B086VXVYCY</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/itsthegrandtour/">https://www.instagram.com/itsthegrandtour/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/thegrandtour">https://twitter.com/thegrandtour</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thegrandtour">https://www.facebook.com/thegrandtour</a><br /><br />Join Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May as they travel across the globe on their Grand Tour. A show about adventure, excitement and friendship… as long as you accept that the people you call friends are also the ones you find extremely annoying. Sometimes it’s even a show about cars, reviewing Italian classics, hot hatchbacks, muscle cars, pick-up trucks, luxury vehicles and more. There’s something for everyone (If you like middle-aged men doing things with cars, then this is the show for you!)  <br /><br />Prime Video has thousands of popular movies and TV shows, including award-winning Amazon Originals, plus live sport and more. All included with Prime!<br /><br />#JamesMay #OurManInJapan #GoKarting{% endraw %}
