{% raw %}When Josh picked up his rusty 1.8l MX5 NA we all laughed! The car was so rusted and beat up we didn't believe he could turn it around. The Mazda needed a lot of TLC, including a lot of rust repair, new bodykit, new suspension from BC Racing and a lot of bodywork. But here it is! <br /><br />We are also launching our BIGGEST competition to date to coincide with the car reveal! Win a BMW M Experience, a chance to drive Josh's MX5 drift car and a merch bundle by picking up 1 of our 100 skateboard bundles here - <br /><br />FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA:<br /><br />- Facebook - @<br />- Instagram - @<br /><br />GRAB SOME FRESH DRIFT GAMES MERCH:<br /><br />- Merchandise - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dglife.tv/shop">https://dglife.tv/shop</a> <br /><br />#mx5 #miata #mx5drift #driftcar #mx5na #miatadrift{% endraw %}
