Read below with information on how to submit YOUR clips and have a chance at winning a Battle pass! Read below to find out how to submit your clip!<br /><br />When it comes to TOP Valorant highlight videos, we like to do things differently compared to other highlight channels on youtube. First of all myself, like to edit the thumbnails/clips with funny memes and back ground music. The editing allows me to add value to the clips while showing my creativity, how they are either fail, epic or funny moments. This gives the watchers a deeper understanding of what is going on in the clips. By editing the clips myself and giving them &quot;my own touch&quot; I am able to present a more fast paced and enjoyable experience for the viewers.<br /><br />While editing I add music to the clips in the video. On top of that I edit and cut the videos to fit my style of content, on top of that I am a big fan of adding memes and other relevant gimmicks to provide a better overall experience for the viewers. <br /><br />I provide the link to every submitters channel in the description while showing their name on screen throughout the video.<br /><br />#zombs #sentinels #tenz #loud #tarik #opticvsloud #vctclips #valoranthighlights #jettshorts<br /><br />*FAIR USE* No intention of copyright infringement.<br /><br />COPYRIGHTS: FAIR USE, Title 17, US Code (Sections 107-118 of the copyright law): All media in this video is used for purpose of review &amp; commentary under terms of fair use.
