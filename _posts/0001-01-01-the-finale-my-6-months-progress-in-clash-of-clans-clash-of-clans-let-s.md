{% raw %}Clash of Clans Let's Play Progression Series After 6 Months! Judo Sloth Gaming provides tips and tricks whilst progressing through the CoC Account. I have met my goals which were set when starting this series; bring some educational content for the lower TH levels and provide tips on progressing faster in Clash of Clans. We have already hit the 'higher' TH levels and leaves my questioning whether we continue to series, or make something better! I will be reading the comments of the video but this may or may not be the last episode. I will continue to play the account and we will see what the future brings.
