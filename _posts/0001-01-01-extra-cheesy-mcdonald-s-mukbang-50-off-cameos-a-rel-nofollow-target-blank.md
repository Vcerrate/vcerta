I have extra cheesy cheese sauce (nacho cheese), plus 4 big macs, 2 double cheeseburgers, 4 large french fries, and the new Spicy chicken nuggets. Today I talk about my opinion on &quot;bad words&quot; and why we think &quot;bad words&quot; are so &quot;bad.&quot; <br />————————<br />Executive Producers: Jamie Babycado, Princess Abbie, &amp; C.
