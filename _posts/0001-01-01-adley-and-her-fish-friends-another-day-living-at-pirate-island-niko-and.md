{% raw %}Navey reeeeeeally doesn't like potatoes üòÇ<br /><br />JOIN OUR FAM!! --- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/rfgp8V">http://goo.gl/rfgp8V</a><br /><br />Best Fish Friends Day Ever 1248<br /><br />Adley and I are still living at pirate island and we have already decided that if we are going to live here, we need a pet here. But instead of going to the pet store, we head out onto the ice to try and catch one of those fish again, not as breakfast this time, but as a friend. We find a box that is frozen in the lake and after we move it, we find that we hit the jackpot, so many little fishes. Adley, in here very first try, catches one! We keep going till we have a few. They are so cute and Adley loves them, she even gives one of them a kiss. Gross!!<br /><br />We get them in a bowl and head back to the dock house on the beach, which we did clean up a bit. Since we've been living here, we have kinda got in a routine and that includes cleaning here and there. Adley is admiring here new pet friends when she has the idea that we should get them a nice big house to live in. Off to the pet store!!<br /><br />We see gold fish and clown fish, green fish and purple fish. But we don't need more fish, we need a bowl or tank to put them in. While we are looking around, we find little decorations that our fish could swim around that represent pirate island and fairy island. We find a unicorn and a pirate ship, mermaids and root beer barrels. After asking some who knows way more about fish than me, Adley and I pick out some really cool stuff!<br /><br />Back at the house, Jenny has found out that Navey does NOT like mashed potatoes. Jenny ordered some food and the wrong order came. This one had mashed potatoes, a food the neither me, Jenny, Adley, or Niko like. So Jenny thought she do an experiment to see if Navey wanted it or not. It was kinda like real vs fake but for baby navey's taste buds. I wonder if she will like it or not?<br /><br />Its been a good best day ever! Adley and I are still surving out at pirate island, while Niko and Navey are starting to feel better. I can't wait to be back home with the kiddos and Jenny! But for now, we have to set up our new fish tank!<br /><br />\\\\<br />Watch Adley's last video: PiRATE DAD vs FAiRY ART!!
