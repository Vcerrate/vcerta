The biggest part of our health lies in our hands and I am excited about showing people that they own their health by taking the responsibility for their choices. After I was able to resolve quite some stubborn symptoms only by changing my diet and adding in some supplements, I fell in love with the functional medicine approach and for me there is no way back. I love finding a way to help you in your very unique situation with the help of some solid science, as well as some unconventional ways to better well-being.<br /><br />Contact:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.privatarztpraxis-hoelscher.de/">https://www.privatarztpraxis-hoelscher.de/</a><br />Email: info@praxisbastianhoelscher.de<br /><br />Resources:<br /><br />Yaron Seidman <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hunyuancenter.com/about.html">https://www.hunyuancenter.com/about.html</a> <br />Dr David Perlmutter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drperlmutter.com/">https://www.drperlmutter.com/</a> <br />Dr Rangan Chatterjee <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drchatterjee.com/book/">https://drchatterjee.com/book/</a><br /><br />These videos brought to you by Functional Medicine Health Coach, Mireille Wagner at www.functionalmedicinecoach.ch<br />If you're looking to get started and don't know how, schedule a free chat:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://p.bttr.to/3h1oJzB">https://p.bttr.to/3h1oJzB</a><br />Access my free immune system support checklist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://moo-ve.ck.page/immune-support">https://moo-ve.ck.page/immune-support</a><br /><br />Disclaimer: The information provided in these interviews is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment that can be provided by your own Medical Provider (including doctor/physician, nurse, physicianâ€™s assistant, or any other health professional), Mental Health Provider (including psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist, counselor, or social worker), registered dietitian or licensed nutritionist.{% endraw %}
