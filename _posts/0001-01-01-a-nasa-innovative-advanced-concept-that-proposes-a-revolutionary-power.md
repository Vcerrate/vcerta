{% raw %}Researchers are working on a concept that could change the way planetary descent probes are powered. The idea is to generate electricity as the spacecraft drops through the atmosphere by harvesting energy from the descent. The high energy output from this new power system could enable probes to last longer, dive deeper, and do more to explore.<br /> <br />NASA 360 takes a look at the NASA Innovative Advanced Concept (NIAC) called RIPS, the Rotor/Impeller Power System.<br /> <br />To learn more about NASAâ€™s Innovative Advanced Concepts program visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/niac">https://www.nasa.gov/niac</a><br /> <br />To watch the in-depth presentation about this topic please visit the 2019 NIAC Symposium Livestream site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3rfr427">https://bit.ly/3rfr427</a><br /> <br />This video represents a research study within the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program. NIAC is a visionary and far-reaching aerospace program, one that has the potential to create breakthrough technologies for possible future space missions. However, such early stage technology developments may never become actual NASA missions.{% endraw %}
