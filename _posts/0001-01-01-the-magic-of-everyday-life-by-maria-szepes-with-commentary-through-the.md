{% raw %}Through the magic of everyday life, we become acquainted with the secret teachings of hermetic philosophy.  Magic in reality means power, the magic power of the imagination manifesting form.<br /><br />Most illness is psychosomatic in origin, a product of creative imagination.<br />Imagination is a great magician. In its lack of self awareness it is a black magician.<br /><br />With  deep insight through her work as a psychologist and character analyst Maria Szepes, the author of the Red Lion The Elixir Of Eternal Life, delves into the inner reaches of the subconscious to the invisible roots of cause and effect. The object of her methods is to produce the antidote from injuries that have coagulated into self tormenting phantoms;  healing images to replace disease causing ones.<br /><br />The Magic Of Everyday life offers solution for mastery over discontent, how to step aside from painful conflict and how we can become successful, engaging, popular and creative members of society.  Each exercise and healing counsel helps us break through a thick fog of this space time illusion. By their application enormous rejuvenating power unfolds within us and we experience the joy of our recovery in the form of greater activity, resplendent equilibrium and true magic in our daily lives.<br /><br />The New Earth Activation trainings - Immerse yourself in 12 hours of content focused on the new earth with channelings, meditations, advanced training and access to the new earth <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://realityrevolutioncon.com/newearth">https://realityrevolutioncon.com/newearth</a><br /><br /><br />Alternate Universe Reality Activation  get full access to new meditations, new lectures, recordings from the reality con and the 90 day AURA meditation schedule<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://realityrevolutionlive.com/aura45338118">https://realityrevolutionlive.com/aura45338118</a><br /><br /><br />BUY MY BOOK!
