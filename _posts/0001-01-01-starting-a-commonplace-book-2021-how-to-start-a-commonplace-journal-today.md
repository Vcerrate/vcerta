{% raw %}Today I am sharing a little look inside how I start a new Commonplace book. I share what a commonplace journal/book is and why you should start one. Commonplace Books are wonderful journals to keep if you are a youtuber, podcaster, or writer. It is a storehouse of wisdom and inspiration. I am starting a new Commonplace journal for 2021 and thought I would show my process at starting a new book. Remember: there are no rules. Create the commonplace book that works best for you.{% endraw %}
