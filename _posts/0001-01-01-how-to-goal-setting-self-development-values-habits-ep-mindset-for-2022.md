{% raw %}ep. mindset for 2022: goal-setting, self-development, values, habits<br /><br />Hi everyone. <br /><br />Straight to the point, in this video, I talk about goal-setting and setting a strong mindset for the new year. Although we‚Äôre already at the end of January, it‚Äôs never too late to think about these things. I also talk about guiding principles I live by, why self-development is so important, and some of my goals for the new year. <br /><br />I hope you can gain at least some value out of this video and I genuinely wish the best for everyone in this upcoming year. <br /><br />Lots of love, Julie. <br /><br /><br />timestamp <br />intro 0:00<br />why goal-setting, mindset, and self-reflection are so important 1:35 <br />my rules for goal-setting 4:56<br />my mindset + values for 2022 6:39<br />my goals for 2022 12:38<br />4 goals for everyone 13:39<br />concluding remarks 15:05<br /><br />üçì<br />if you haven‚Äôt watched already: <br />end of 2021 vlog<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/46XFz6aukhI">https://youtu.be/46XFz6aukhI</a><br /><br />ü•≠<br />instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jjuliecho/">https://www.instagram.com/jjuliecho/</a><br />email julie@oneofone.io<br />spotify <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/juliech...">https://open.spotify.com/user/juliech...</a><br /><br /><br />filmed on Canon G7X mark III / final cut pro <br /><br />#2022{% endraw %}
