{% raw %}Lost month Los Angeles was headline news all over the world because of the Union Pacific train at Lincoln Park that was robbed from thousands of parcels and packages. Thousands of Americans will never receive their UPS, Fedex and Amazon parcels because their packages have been stolen from a train.<br /><br />After studying the images of the visit that California governor Gavin Newsom made to the location of the train, I get this uncomfortable feeling that Newsom has used this robbery in order to create his own media event.<br /><br />His visit to the location of the train was not about the victims and their suffering, but to me it looked like a carefully staged photo-shoot in order to make Newsom look good and give him the opportunity to express some political statements. <br /><br />The most surreal of them being Newsom, apologizing for calling the criminals who robbed this train 'organized gangs'. Because as of now, we should call criminal gangs &quot;organized groups of folks&quot;.<br />I'd say our local tennis club is an organized group of folks.<br />But who am I...<br /><br />I also discovered, from images in Google Street View, that at that specific location in Los Angeles, trains most likely have been robbed for several years now. Street View shows empty boxes lying around the railroad tracks at least since 2019. So it looks as if this has been going on for a long time now. And the authorities have let it grow and grow up to the complete ridiculousness we saw last month. What a mess...{% endraw %}
