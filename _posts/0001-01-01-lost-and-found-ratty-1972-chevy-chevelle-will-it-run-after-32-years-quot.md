{% raw %}&quot;Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.&quot; - 2 Corinthians 5:17<br /><br />This 1972 Chevelle has been around the block! Literally... it's at my neighbor's house just down the road. Think it'll run and drive after 32 years? Stick around to the end of the video to find out!<br /><br />MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dylanmccool.bigcartel.com">https://dylanmccool.bigcartel.com</a><br />Instagram: @dylanmccool<br /><br />Junkyard Digs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS87-wYrvmexsLkBj0jhrnQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS87-wYrvmexsLkBj0jhrnQ</a><br /><br />Send me something!<br />Dylan McCool<br />PO Box 398<br />Hazel Green, AL 35750<br /><br />SHARE YOUR PROJECT:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/593980851453429/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/593980851453429/</a><br /><br />Like my Facebook page! www.facebook.com/dylanmccool1970<br /><br />#mccoolauto #restoration #chevelle{% endraw %}
