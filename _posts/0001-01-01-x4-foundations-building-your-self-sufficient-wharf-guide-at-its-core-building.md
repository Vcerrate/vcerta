{% raw %}At its core, building a self-sufficient wharf in X4 Foundations 4.20 is simply adding modules as you need them to keep all production modules running consistently. But like many projects most of the difficulty is at the beginning where you are trying to come up with a plan on how to get started. This guide will focus on the beginning steps on how to get your own wharf and shipyard up and running and eventually turning a profit. Or an unending wave of combat ships if domination is your goal. <br /><br />Building Your First Station:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6VkMr1w5UOo">https://youtu.be/6VkMr1w5UOo</a><br /><br />the xml file for that stations plans can be found here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=195&amp;t=444293">https://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=195&amp;t=444293</a><br /><br />Closed Captions available.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/392160/X4_Foundations/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/392160/X4_Foundations/</a><br />X4: Foundations is the latest title in the popular X series of space simulation / sandbox games, played as action games from a first-person perspective in a living breathing universe, with TRADE FIGHT BUILD THINK as the common tag-line. X4: Foundations is unique in its depth, simulating an entire universe of NPC ships and stations, forming a realistic economy. It consists of a huge universe, simulated from the bottom up. Hundreds of stations, and thousands of ships, trade goods among themselves. Prices change based on supply and demand; resources are mined and processed in several stages. This economy is linked directly to the simulation of major conflicts in a universe with dynamically-acting factions. Every player decision can dramatically change the future of the game universe. Step in and live your very own space adventure!<br /><br />#x4foundations{% endraw %}
