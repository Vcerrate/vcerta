{% raw %}The Vitality at Sea Fitness Center is the gym onboard Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas.  If you have been on a cruise before, you know that every cruise ship gym is created different: different equipment, lower/higher ceiling heights, more weights, and difference machines.  <br /><br />This will be a comprehensive tour of how you can have a healthy cruise and use the cruise ship fitness center onboard Oasis of the Seas!  I will highlight all the cardio and weight lifting machines so you will know what your exercise routine can look like once onboard!<br /><br />The Oasis Class ships also feature the Vitality Café serving coffee, fresh pressed juices, and protein shakes!  No need to bring your mixers and elixirs as this ship has it covered!<br /><br />If on one of these longer cruises, ensure it is a healthy cruise!{% endraw %}
