{% raw %}* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *<br />Altavista, Virginia — Bodycam video captures Altavista Police Chief assisting a man in his proposal to his girlfriend. Altavista Police Chief Thomas Merricks says Ben approached him a few months ago about planning a proposal for his girlfriend, Sierra. The bodycam video shows the town’s top cop pulling over 25-year-old Ben Mitchell in his red pick-up truck. Merricks asked the couple to step out of the vehicle. That’s when Harrison walked behind the truck and found Mitchell on one knee — engagement ring in hand, and he popped the question.<br />And, she said yes!<br />Altavista Police Chief Tommy Merricks said this ranks as one of the best moments in his 33-year career. Merricks said he was honored to participate in this special day. Mitchell and Harrison are expecting their first child and say they’re waiting until after the baby’s birth to schedule their wedding -- but they plan on inviting Merricks -- and he plans on being there.<br /><br />Donate to PoliceActivity: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity">https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity</a><br />Like us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PoliceActivity">https://www.facebook.com/PoliceActivity</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Police_Activity">https://twitter.com/Police_Activity</a>{% endraw %}
