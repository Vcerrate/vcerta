{% raw %}The United States of America likes to pride itself as an epitome of truth and justice to both its inhabitants and the rest of the world. Over the years since its inception, there has been one too much evidence that proves that even the great American way is as flawed and as biased as they come.<br /><br />There's an untapped level just beneath hell, which it sought to explore. The country was split between a Jim Crow South and the other half that would come to be known as the Union.<br /><br />The South favored the continued oppression and disenfranchisement of people of color. On the other hand, the Union considered everyone to have somewhat equal rights. Hence, the civil war.<br /><br />But this isn't about the war, it's about one of the most overt and brazen acts of evil ever perpetrated, which saw the death of a minor in a case that followed anything but the due legal processes. It begs the question of how we continue to trust the criminal justice system even when they show an abject lack of objectivity and prejudice to a particular sect.<br /><br />They had one job.<br /><br />Welcome or welcome back to another episode of Twisted Minds, my name is James, and today, we'll be looking into the case of 14 year old, George Stinney Jr, who was subjected to the electric chair for being of color in the wrong place at the wrong time.{% endraw %}
