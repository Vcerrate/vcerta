{% raw %}1000 Elden Way is a beautiful contemporary home in Beverly Hills. From the moment you walk into the grand living room, you realize this place is all about scale and opulence. Interiors are bright and airy with walls of glass, marble floors, and reflective surfaces adding to the resort-like sense of luxury.{% endraw %}
