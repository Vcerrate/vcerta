You can demolish every structure in the game piece by piece. In addition, every object you see in the game world--save for small decorative plants and rocks--is part of the physics system. Each element of the world interacts with each other and together they create a physical, visceral world to play with.<br />Build Your Vehicle<br /> <br />Build a vehicle your way, with an ever-expanding array of parts and pieces. Using an intuitive vehicle construction system that also lets you customize your vehicles' appearance and controls, you'll always have fun creating your next awesome invention.<br /><br />From simple splitters to advanced joints, a variety of parts slowly unlock as you play through the game, and each unlocks countless new possibilities.<br /> <br />While some vehicles will perform better than others in accomplishing your objectives, it's always a bit more fun to get creative and go a little off script. Optional bonus challenges and objectives will reward more creative builders and add more replayability.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1428100/Instruments_of_Destruction/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1428100/Instruments_of_Destruction/</a><br /><br />#realcivilengineer #engineering #InstrumentsOfDestruction{% endraw %}
