{% raw %}First half of our Double Trouble Thursday where we post two reactions in one day brings Metro Exodus to the channel. The video we watched said this was the &quot;full cinematic movie&quot; &quot;mutant monsters all cinematic trailers&quot;. It had Artyom's Nightmare in it which is one we definitely wanted to check out so figured anything after that was a nice bonus. Hope you enjoy our Metro Exodus Trailer Reaction!<br /><br />For more Reactions check out our second Definitely Not Definitive channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DefinitelyNotDefinitive2">https://www.youtube.com/c/DefinitelyNotDefinitive2</a><br /><br />You can further support the channel and help us bring you more reactions by becoming a patron  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/definitelynotdefinitive">https://www.patreon.com/definitelynotdefinitive</a><br /><br />Tips are always welcome via StreamElements which goes 100% to us instead of having to do a revenue split - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://streamelements.com/definitelynotdefinitive/tip">https://streamelements.com/definitelynotdefinitive/tip</a><br /><br />We have some merchandise available now - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://definitelynotdefinitive.myspreadshop.com/">https://definitelynotdefinitive.myspreadshop.com/</a><br /><br />See our silliness on Instagram- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/wearedefinitelynotdefinitive/">https://www.instagram.com/wearedefinitelynotdefinitive/</a><br /><br />Link to original video - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/a8iD3hs9dZs">https://youtu.be/a8iD3hs9dZs</a><br /><br />#metroexodus #reactionvideo #doubletroublethursday #metroexodusps5{% endraw %}
