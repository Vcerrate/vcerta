Previous iterations of the C4 have taken the form of the humble (and slightly humdrum) hatchback, and was the fashion of the time. Now that everybody seems to want an SUV, the latest C4 has taken the form of a crossover. And a very elaborately styled one at that.<br /><br />Now, the thing about elaborate styling is that it's very divisive. Depending on your outlook, it might look like the funkiest car you've ever seen, or it might look like the most frightful. Either way, you're not going to miss it. But does it have the substance to back up the style?<br /><br />Rebecca Jackson finds out in this CarGurus UK video review, which looks at the car's practicality, pricing, quality, equipment, technology and what it's like to drive.<br /><br />Read our full written review of the Citroen C4 here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cargurus.co.uk/Cars/Citroen-C4-2020-Generation-Overview-mg441">https://www.cargurus.co.uk/Cars/Citroen-C4-2020-Generation-Overview-mg441</a><br /><br />CarGurus can help you find great deals on used cars from top-rated dealers in your area.
