{% raw %}We’re back! It’s not quite normal yet in the Young household but we try to make do and have as much fun and positivity as we can. Today I’m really thankful I got to see my OB, Dr. Mendoza, again. After 10 long weeks since my last appointment, I was getting anxious about baby #2 and just wanted to make sure he was okay. I’m glad to report... everything is perfectly normal! The best news ever!<br /><br />So many Scottie moments in today’s vlog to help keep your spirits up! He cooks breakfast with me every morning, and we finally got to record it again after so long. He also got to play with Dada Slater today, which is a rare occasion. He loooves and adores his daddy, and it was such a great day for the whole family! Enjoy #skyfam!<br />---<br />Music from EPIDEMIC SOUND: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/38jRSq">http://share.epidemicsound.com/38jRSq</a><br />(free 30 day trial with link above!)<br /><br />Follow ME:<br />www.kryzuy.com<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/kryzzzie">http://instagram.com/kryzzzie</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/kryzzzie">http://twitter.com/kryzzzie</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/kryzzzie">http://facebook.com/kryzzzie</a>{% endraw %}
