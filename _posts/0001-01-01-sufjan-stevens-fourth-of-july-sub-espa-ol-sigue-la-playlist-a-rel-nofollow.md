My fading supply<br />&quot;Did you get enough love, my little dove<br />Why do you cry?<br />And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best<br />Though it never felt right<br />My little Versailles&quot;<br />The hospital asked should the body be cast<br />Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky<br />Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth<br />Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?<br />&quot;Shall we look at the moon, my little loon<br />Why do you cry?<br />Make the most of your life, while it is rife<br />While it is light<br />Well you do enough talk<br />My little hawk, why do you cry?<br />Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?<br />Or the Fourth of July?<br />We're all gonna die&quot;<br />We're all gonna die<br />We're all gonna die<br />We're all gonna die<br />We're all gonna die<br />We're all gonna die<br />We're all gonna die<br />We're all gonna die<br /><br />&quot;Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
