Maybe your lifestyle is too stressful.<br /><br />Sure, that could be the case... but probably you're NOT tired. More likely, I think, is that you're just lethargic. A lack of movement, lots of artificial light, sugary snacks... all this puts us into a &quot;rest and digest state&quot; while also disconnecting us from our bodies. The result is that we feel slow and sluggish and we struggle to get up off the couch.<br /><br />The solution is just to inject more movement into the day. This video will help you to do that. <br /><br />Bit of a shorter one here in a slightly different style. I'm keen to see what you guys make of it! Partly this was due to unforeseen circumstances (thanks Covid!). I'm also trying to gently introduce more cognitive/lifestyle/productivity content again but in a more organic manner people will actually watch. Fingers crossed and let me know what you think!<br /><br />Thanks guys, and bye for now!{% endraw %}
