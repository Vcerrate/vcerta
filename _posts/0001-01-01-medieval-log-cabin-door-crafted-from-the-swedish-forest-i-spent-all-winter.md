{% raw %}I spent all winter learning and perfecting this craft by hand. This is my first door I have built. Everything is hand-made just from the materials I could forage in the Swedish forest. Except from the hinges and lock, I could have made these myself also but found them dirt cheap at a flea market. The nails, the wood, moss insulation, the key, the wooden handle and the handle on the latch made from a deer horn, is all materials made or forage by myself, (basically everything).<br /><br />Hope you like this video. I am finally learning how to edit properly, hopefully you notice the better quality. Let me know. This could have easily been a 2 hour video, on every step more in detail. I am thinking about starting a new channel which releases the full versions of my videos. Let me also know if this is something you would watch. Thank you.<br /><br />Subscribe for more log cabin videos!<br /><br />The clothes I am wearing are from the Swedish brand Revolution Race!<br /><br />Use my code and get 15% OFFüèÜ<br />‚úîÔ∏èGRANKVIST15<br /><br />This is their website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Grankvist-RVRC">https://bit.ly/Grankvist-RVRC</a><br /><br />Enjoy.{% endraw %}
