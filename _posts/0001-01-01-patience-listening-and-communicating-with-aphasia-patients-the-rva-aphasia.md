{% raw %}The RVA Aphasia Group in Richmond VA wanted to help people better understand and communicate with stroke survivors with aphasia.  Aphasia is a disorder of communication that impairs a person's ability to use and comprehend language.<br /><br />To help family, loved ones, strangers and healthcare professionals better communicate with aphasia patients they produced an 18 minute video called Patience, Listening and Communicating With Aphasia Patients. The video helps people better understand what it's like to have aphasia and how best to communicate with someone who has it.{% endraw %}
