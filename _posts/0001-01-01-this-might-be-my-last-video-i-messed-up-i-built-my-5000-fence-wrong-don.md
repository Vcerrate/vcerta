{% raw %}I built my $5000 fence wrong! Don't make this mistake on your four board fence. It's kinda dangerous. For your chance to win the Airstream and support a great cause, enter at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.omaze.com/haxman.">https://www.omaze.com/haxman.</a> I love the look of this four board fence it just doesn't keep my dogs in. I should have run welded wire fence behind the boards before they were installed but I'll just have to try and attach it now that they are installed. Thanks for watching! <br />üëç SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Iy7PK3">https://bit.ly/2Iy7PK3</a><br /><br />How Did They Install A Fence This Crazy Fast?  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/71Q3MHJMagc">https://youtu.be/71Q3MHJMagc</a><br /><br />Her Reaction Made This Fireplace Mantle Worth All The Work <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/yaGyoe2cck0">https://youtu.be/yaGyoe2cck0</a><br /><br />Family Converts 7x12 Cargo Trailer Into Camper / Tiny House  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/E4W8WSZ-LQ0">https://youtu.be/E4W8WSZ-LQ0</a><br /><br />The Best Way To Use An Old Wine Barrel! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/welEdTihgfQ">https://youtu.be/welEdTihgfQ</a><br /><br />Family Building Projects<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCK5XUSikQGpXq9HNKO-wqRobKhjzPd7l">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCK5XUSikQGpXq9HNKO-wqRobKhjzPd7l</a><br /><br /> I hope to inspire you to create your own projects at home after watching my videos.
