Chasing losses and spending far more than you can realistically afford to lose will land you in debt and will have profoundly negative effects on your home and social life. Here are a few tips you can follow to gamble safely:<br /><br />* Consider gambling as a fun hobby, not a source of income.<br />* Never exceed the financial limits you set yourself.<br />* Don't gamble with more than you can afford to lose.<br />* Don't play endlessly; set yourself time limits.<br />* Resist chasing losses.<br />* Gamble openly. If you're truly in control of the situation, then you have nothing to hide.<br />* Listen to your friends and loved ones if they begin to show signs of concern.<br /><br /><br />If you believe that you are developing an addiction to gambling, then contact <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.begambleaware.org/​​">https://www.begambleaware.org/​​</a>{% endraw %}
