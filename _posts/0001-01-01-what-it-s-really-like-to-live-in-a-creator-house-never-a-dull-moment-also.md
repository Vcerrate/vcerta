I use it with a 16-50mm lens which imo is the BEST LENS OF ALL TIME!!!! super small lens but you can still get wide shots + manually zoom it! I even put it on my Sony a7S sometimes :)) <br /><br />Sony a7s with 16-35mm or 24-105mm lenses <br />The Sony a7S is one of the best cameras I’ve ever used - I often use it for sit-down videos or for travel vlogging and the footage always looks BEAUTIFUL!! Amazing background blur + love the wide shots you can get with the 16-35mm. Occasionally I also use a 24-105mm lens when I want to zoom further and love that lens as well!<br /><br />✧SONY ZV-1 TIPS✧<br />- if you put it in the product showcase setting you can get a wider angled shot! Also if you shoot in 1080p you’ll get a wider shot than in 4k :)<br />- put your camera at 120p if filming in slow motion for the smoothest shot!<br />- use background defocus mode to help blur the background!<br />- the onboard audio is super good so I actually don’t find that I need an external mic but LOVE that there is an option for one! <br /><br />(っ◔◡◔)っ  MY SOCIALS  <br />click here to see all! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://flow.page/ashleyalexander​​">https://flow.page/ashleyalexander​​</a><br />✪ TIKTOK @urmomaaashleyk <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/u7uSr9/​​">https://vm.tiktok.com/u7uSr9/​​</a><br />✪ INSTA @aaashleyk (aye aye ashley k) :P <br />✪ SPOTIFY @urmomashley<br />✪ PODCAST: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.flowcode.com/page/extradynamicpodcast">https://www.flowcode.com/page/extradynamicpodcast</a><br /><br />I edit w/ Final Cut Pro X and Premier!<br />current sub count: 1,200,000 (thanks for 1.2 milli!
