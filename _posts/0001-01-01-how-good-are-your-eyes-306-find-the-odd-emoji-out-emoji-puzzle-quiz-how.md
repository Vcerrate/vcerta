{% raw %}HOW GOOD ARE YOUR EYES #306 | Find The Odd Emoji Out | Emoji Puzzle Quiz<br />How good is your eyesight? Here’s a simple eyesight test that will show how sharp your eyes are. <br />We all know that “eyes are the windows to the soul.” Do your windows need cleaning, or are they crystal clear and give a sharp picture of the world? Take this test to find it out!<br />There will be 4 stages, and it will get harder and harder with every stage. The first one might seem like a piece of cake (and if you’re actually seeing a piece of cake we’ve got problems), but the further we go, the more concentration it will require. In fact, only 8 % of people can pass stage 4 because it is so hard. <br />You will have the same task for every question in all the stages. The task is to pick 1 out of 10 colors which is different from the rest. To pass each of the stages, you have to find that odd one out in each task. If you fail once, you fail the entire stage.<br />We will then watch the clip you've sent us and if we like it, we will feature it in a future Tim video!<br />- Music : [No Copyright Music] Cute Background Music:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyC6N0lKUWg&amp;t=467s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyC6N0lKUWg&amp;t=467s</a><br />Please Like &amp; Subcribe to watch more videos<br />▶ Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/yxa8fqhe">https://tinyurl.com/yxa8fqhe</a> <br />▶ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/100057229070170">https://www.facebook.com/100057229070170</a><br />#findemoji  #oddoneout  #timgaming{% endraw %}
