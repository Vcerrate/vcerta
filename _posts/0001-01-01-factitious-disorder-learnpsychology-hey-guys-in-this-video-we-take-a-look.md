{% raw %}Hey guys, in this video we take a look at Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self and Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another, otherwise known as Munchausen syndrome and Munchausen syndrome by proxy respectively. <br /><br />I really enjoyed making this video, I think Iâ€™m going to start a series where I go through the DSM-5 and unravel different mental disorders similarly to in this video!  At the same time, I think access to information in the DSM is very important, and having these short videos on specific disorders will hopefully prove to help at least one person!  Please Remember that these videos do not provide a diagnosis, or the ability for a viewer to make a diagnosis.  Rather, they are informational.  If you believe that you or anyone you know suffers from this or any disorder, please seek professional help! <br /><br />EDIT* In the video, i reference The Act as a movie.  It is actually a tv series.<br /><br />References:<br /><br />American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders.
