{% raw %}IMMERSE YOURSELF IN THIS WORK<br /><br />No Limits Society is Bentinho’s exclusive training program for those on a mission to ignite global awakening. This is the official “spiritual gym membership” of Bentinho’s most integrated, refined, and interactive teachings to date.<br /> <br />As a No Limits Society member you will be invited to Bentinho’s near-weekly live training sessions (online or in person) and you will get live access to his realtime chat Q&amp;A with a rotating group of NLS members each month. This is the single best way to immerse yourself in Bentinho’s teachings at this time. <br /><br />In NLS you will have opportunities to put yourself to task, show up in creative ways, involve yourself with the team, step up as a leader, get invited to exclusive NLS-only events, and participate in initiatives you would otherwise never know about. You will also discover Bentinho’s leadership first-hand—not just as a speaker delivering content for an audience to consume—but as a leader with a mission and a team under his wing to purify into a streamlined vehicle of service to all.<br /> <br />Find out more and sign up here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bentinhomassaro.com/nolimitssociety">https://bentinhomassaro.com/nolimitssociety</a><br /><br />————<br />Start your free 7-day trial of Bentinho Massaro TV, home to over 800 hours of video recordings of almost all of Bentinho's retreats and events: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bentinhomassaro.tv">https://www.bentinhomassaro.tv</a><br /><br />For Trinfinity Academy, Bentinho’s free online enlightenment and empowerment school, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.trinfinityacademy.com">https://www.trinfinityacademy.com</a> <br /><br />For Bentinho Massaro’s Free Global Enlightenment Retreat, an 8-session intensive on the mechanics and roadmap to enlightenment, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bentinhomassaro.tv/freeretreat">https://www.bentinhomassaro.tv/freeretreat</a> <br /><br />For The Next Level, a series of exclusive and immersive dialogues with highly committed adepts, visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.civilizationupgraders.com/thenextlevel">https://www.civilizationupgraders.com/thenextlevel</a> <br /><br />For The Shepherding Consciousness Program, a yearlong high-level course on Shepherding, leadership, and enlightened service, visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.civilizationupgraders.com/shepherdingconsciousness">https://www.civilizationupgraders.com/shepherdingconsciousness</a> <br /><br />For info on the Mirror Talks Podcast with Bentinho Massaro, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bentinhomassaro.com/podcast">https://www.bentinhomassaro.com/podcast</a><br /><br />To learn more about Bentinho, subscribe to the newsletter, see upcoming events etc, go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/y4foh4fz">http://tinyurl.com/y4foh4fz</a> or take a look at the complete list of Bentinho’s offerings: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bentinhomassaro.com/offerings">https://www.bentinhomassaro.com/offerings</a> <br />...<br />Find Bentinho on Instagram here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bentinhomassaro">https://www.instagram.com/bentinhomassaro</a> <br />And Facebook here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bentinhomassaro">https://www.facebook.com/bentinhomassaro</a> <br />Join his Facebook community group here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/336863633071053">https://www.facebook.com/groups/336863633071053</a><br />...<br />Donate: If you want to support our mission and make a donation, please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bentinhomassaro.com/donations">https://www.bentinhomassaro.com/donations</a>{% endraw %}
