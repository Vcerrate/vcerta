They have a channel of their own (link above!) with a load more of their builds that I'd definitely recommend checking out!  This truck that Lucy shows us around is a really cool concept from them and almost like the tardis in the amount it opens up when you go in.  It's packed with epic features, like its articulated roof, proper shower, full kitchen complete with electric hob and fridge freezer, electric stairs and super smart hot water and heating system that can run off either electric or gas, so you pretty much always have an option for heat and water!<br /><br />Do you want to feature your van?
