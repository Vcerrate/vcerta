{% raw %}Beef braciole (involtini) are a classic, rustic Italian dish that allows cheap, touch cuts of beef to get the glow-up they deserve.  Plate this ragout up over some vegan cauliflower mash and you have a comforting plate of &quot;steak and potatoes&quot; that's far better for you and just as tasty!<br /><br />Braciole and Cauliflower Mash<br />Serves 3-4<br />For the Braciole<br />6 thinly sliced pieces of top or bottom round beef<br />1 cup plain or panko breadcrumbs<br />½ cup grated parmesan cheese<br />1 T + 1 t Italian seasoning <br />1 medium white or yellow onion, diced<br />1 28 oz can crushed tomatoes<br />2-3 cloves of garlic, minced<br />¾ cup red wine<br />Salt and Pepper to taste<br />Twine or toothpicks to secure the braciola<br />3-4 sprigs of fresh basil<br />2 T olive oil<br /><br />Mix the breadcrumbs, 1 T Italian seasoning and cheese in a bowl.  Lay out a piece of beef and season lightly with salt.  Add a layer of breadcrumbs to the beef and carefully and tightly roll the beef up.  Secure with toothpicks or butchers twine.  Repeat with additional pieces of beef.<br /><br />Heat olive oil over medium high heat in a skillet.  Sear beef on both sides until golden brown.  Add the onions and sweat out for 4-5 minutes or until softened.  Add the garlic and cook for one minute.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and then add the wine.  Scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze any fond accumulated.  Cook the alcohol out for 2-3 minutes then add the tomatoes.  Stir to combine, bring to simmer and then cover and reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour.  <br /><br />Remove lid, add the basil and stir into the sauce.  Cook uncovered for 10-15 minutes or until the sauce is slightly reduced.<br /><br />For the Cauliflower Mash<br />1 head of cauliflower broken down into florets<br />2 T olive oil<br />1 cup warm coconut milk (less or more depending on desired consistency)<br />Salt and pepper to taste<br /><br />In a large bowl, toss the cauliflower florets with the oil and salt and pepper.  Season with any additional herbs and spices as desired.<br />Bake at 425 for 30-35 minutes or until tender and slightly browned.<br />Add to a blender or food processor and add a bit of the warm coconut milk.  Blend and slowly drizzle in the milk until the cauliflower mash (puree) reaches your desired consistency.  Taste and adjust seasoning.<br />To plate, add a few dollops of cauliflower mash and top with one of your braciole and sauce.  Garnish with parsley and more grated parmesan cheese.{% endraw %}
