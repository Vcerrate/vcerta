{% raw %}Everyone that has done BJJ for 6 months knows how to do a triangle. The question is do they know how to do the triangle in an effective way. I learned my triangle from Dustin &quot;Clean&quot; Denes, the man is known as &quot;The King of the Triangle&quot; and rightfully so. In this video I break down the triangle from guard giving the finer points of the movement to increase control, pressure and overall finishing percentage.<br /><br />If you're a triangle guy/girl this video is a must watch!<br /><br />Like / Share / Subscribe!!!<br /><br />IG: @BenStarkHH<br />Twitter: @BenStarkHH<br />FB: www.FaceBook.com/BenStarkATT{% endraw %}
