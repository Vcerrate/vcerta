{% raw %}Saint Victoria is the patron of Anticoli, Italy was an early Christian martyr. She is one example of faithful catholic women who were killed after spurning a powerful pagan suitor. <br /><br />Her incorrupt body lies in the only competed structure designed by the Barpque architect Carlo Maderno.<br /><br />Their whole story is probably a pious myth though they did actually live. Saint Victoria's feast is usually celebrated on December 23.<br /><br />-------<br /><br />ðŸŽ¶ Background music:<br />Track: The Martyrs Song<br />Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/noqbDeWoUcM">https://youtu.be/noqbDeWoUcM</a><br /><br />-------<br /><br />Let's get in touch!
