{% raw %}Lillian Segal, Leivallyn Kaupu and I flew to Kosrae to make a movie.  Kosrae is the smallest and most isolated state in the Federated States of Micronesia.  The island sustains perhaps 6,000; and is called a “high” island with steep mountains and largely untouched rain forests.  Lillian had grown up in Pohnpei.  Her mother was from Ute Village in Kosrae — where Lillian spent many memorable holidays throughout her childhood.<br /><br />Lillian’s brother Canston was a fisherman in Ute.  He lived with his wife Martha and children on a tiny farm adjoining an inland waterway where he docked his fishing boat.  <br /><br />Canston's and Martha's house was constructed of concrete “block” including a flat roof which served as the foundation to a second story thatch-roof bedroom which belonged to Lillian whenever she visited.  The 3 of us — Lillian, Lei and me — resided for nearly 2 weeks in Lillian’s rooftop hideaway throughout the making of the film.<br /><br />We recruited nearly a dozen village children to help us with the production — including a teenager with Cerebral Palsy named Stacie who lived in Malem a nearby village.  We rented a pick-up truck to carry our exuberant crew hither and yon as we plotted, planned and recorded our adventures.<br /><br />The theme of our movie was preparation of a “healthful” Kosraen feast — using natural ingredients and familiar cooking methods.  We caught our fish; harvested our crops; and prepared a meal which we shared with a neighbor who suffered from diabetes — both as an act of kindness and as a reminder that diet and nutrition are essential for healthful island life.<br /><br />Upon returning to Hawai’i, we edited the film as attached below.  The edited version was copied to more than a hundred DVD’s and sent back to the island as a gift of appreciation.{% endraw %}
