{% raw %}Let’s View The World TV<br />www.lvtw.tv<br /><br />Don't ask me why you are not allowed to film inside 711, cause I have no idea and it's everywhere in the world! I FINALLY was introduced via a friend to a 711 owner in Taiwan who allowed my to shoot some video to introduce the services they provide! Very exciting! I also managed to shoot a quick second clip on my favorite thing they sell!<br /><br />I’ve been living in Taiwan for many many years, and there are so many wonderful things I have learnt and experienced here. I primarily started this channel to share some of my experiences related to lifestyle, culture and tourism in Taiwan. The channel has since evolved and I’ve done similar videos on a couple of other cities around the world.  <br />我已經住了台灣多年。 學到了很多關於台灣文化和旅遊的知識。 那個時候我開始拍了YOUTUBE影片想介紹台灣。 目前我已經拍了幾個不同國家的旅遊YOUTUBE影片。<br />Hopefully my videos give you some helpful tips and ideas about Taiwan! <br />希望我拍的YOUTUBE影片給大家介紹台灣的生活方式和文化.<br /><br />Love YouTube, but you should really also check out my web page! Lots more information, links, maps, tips and other videos that you might like or find useful, not to mention everything is neatly arranged under country categories too! <br /><br />Thanks for watching, subscribe to my channel to get notifications when I post new videos, and I often post new videos! ;) Also please leave a comment below if you think of something interesting I should video!<br /><br />#MyTaiwan<br /><br />Twiiter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/anjelvtw">https://twitter.com/anjelvtw</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/LvTw.tv/">https://www.facebook.com/LvTw.tv/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/anje_lvtw">http://instagram.com/anje_lvtw</a>{% endraw %}
