{% raw %}Associated With a Sign of The Apocalypse, a Puddle of Water Near The Dead Sea Turns Blood Red<br />Recently, the people of Jordan and Israel were shocked by the change in the color of the water in a puddle near the Dead Sea.<br />It is known, the color of the water in the puddle turns red like blood, which raises speculation that the apocalypse is near.<br />To find out the cause of this phenomenon, Jordan is reported to have sent a research team to the puddle near the Dead Sea.<br />&quot;The Jordanian Ministry of Water has sent a technical team to take samples and find out the reason for the discoloration of the water,&quot; according to Jordanian media.<br />The red puddle quickly became viral among netizens after residents around the Dead Sea uploaded photos of the puddle on social media.<br />Netizens also wondered how the discoloration in the puddles could have happened.<br />Many netizens believe that this phenomenon is a blood plague which is a sign of the coming apocalypse as stated in the Bible.<br />However, scientists believe the cause of the discoloration of the water as a natural phenomenon that often occurs.<br />It is known, the puddles around the Dead Sea turn red in color due to algae, iron oxide, or the addition of substances by humans.<br />This was said by Sakhr Al-Nosour who is the head of the Jordanian Geological Syndicate.<br />&quot;It could be due to the abundance of algae in the puddle, or it could be a hazardous substance that humans dumped there,&quot; he said.<br />Meanwhile, a ministry spokesman named Omar Salama said that the puddle was small and isolated from the waters of the Dead Sea.<br />&quot;The puddles are not part of the Dead Sea, they are separated even though they are close,&quot; he said.<br />The results of the research team's examination of the puddle are scheduled to be released in the coming days.<br />It is known, the change in the color of the water to red in the area is not the first time this has happened.{% endraw %}
