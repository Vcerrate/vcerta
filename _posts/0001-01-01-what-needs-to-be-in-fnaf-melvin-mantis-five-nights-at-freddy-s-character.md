As always remember to like, comment, share, subscribe, and ring that bell! <br />and tell us down what you think and what you'd like to see going forward with the FNAF series.<br /><br />#FNAF #fivenightsatfreddys #fnafsecuritybreach<br /><br />Five Nights at Freddy's is an American media franchise created by Scott Cawthon, which began with the eponymous 2014 video game and has since gained worldwide popularity<br /><br />Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds!<br /><br />From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!<br /><br />Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?<br /><br />Five nights at freddy's, fnaf, fnaf characters, fnaf lore, fnaf security breach, five nights at freddy's security breach, five nights at freddy's fan characters, fnaf fan fiction, five nights at freddy's new character, fnaf character concepts, fnaf fan art, freddy fazbear, golden freddy, fnaf chica, fnaf bonnie, fnaf foxy, five nights at Freddy's game, fnaf theory, fnaf theories, fnaf movie, fnaf short, fnaf animated movie, fnaf Praying mantis character, fnaf fan made character, fnaf bee, fnaf bug character, fnaf <br /><br />Instagram<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gamerjoob/">https://www.instagram.com/gamerjoob/</a><br />Facebook <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GamerJoob/">https://www.facebook.com/GamerJoob/</a><br />Twitter <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GamerJoob">https://twitter.com/GamerJoob</a><br /><br />DEVELOPER: Scott Cawthon<br />PUBLISHER: Scott Cawthon<br />FRANCHISE: Five Nights at Freddy's<br /><br />Credits<br />Music- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.purple-planet.com">https://www.purple-planet.com</a>{% endraw %}
