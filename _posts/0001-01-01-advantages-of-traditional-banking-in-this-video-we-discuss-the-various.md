{% raw %}In this video we discuss the various advantages of traditional banking as compared to modern forms of banking.<br />Below are some of the advantages discussed in this video.<br /><br />1. Personal Interaction<br />There is nothing that compares to personal interaction i.e. interacting with a real person when it comes to banking. <br /><br />2. The Ability to Process Cash Transactions<br />If you have cash and would like to have it deposited there is no better place to do it than in a brick and mortar bank branch. Online banks by their very name do not have the ability to process cash transactions for you. They do not have branches after all.<br /><br />3. Notary Services<br />If you need notary services i.e. someone to witness the signing of documents and also to verify the identity of the one signing, then traditional bankers can provide that service. They can do this for free or for a small fee.<br /><br />4. Safe Deposit Boxes<br />The ability to provide safe deposit boxes is another thing that you can only get at a traditional bank. <br /><br />5. Almost Instant Service For Some Transactions like Cashier’s Checks<br />If you are looking for a Cashier’s check then the traditional bank will offer in most cases same day service compared to days for online banking.<br /><br />6. You Can Enjoy The Old and The New Forms of Banking Under One Roof<br />Even though online banks are the in thing nowadays one has to understand that the traditional banks have also done a good job improving their online stuff.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/financematterstoday">https://www.facebook.com/financematterstoday</a>{% endraw %}
