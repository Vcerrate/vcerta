{% raw %}This is a 1978 Ford F-250 Lariat edition that is receiving its first wash in 42 years after sitting in a barn in North Carolina. This Ford truck has 139 original and has been lost on a farm for 42 years after 1 quick drive in later 1978. By disaster detail standards, this is brand new. Untouched. The owner drove it once to drive his daughter to work in the snow...then put it back in the barn. The F-250 is the lowest miles Ford Pickup Truck in the world. I performed a &quot;preservation detail&quot; to keep the condition authentic to the day it was picked up from the dealership. After a proper car wash and light polish, I added AMMO Skin paint sealant instead of a paint coating (AMMO Reflex Pro) to allow the new owner flexibility in how they choose to protect the paint in the future. The before and after is wildly satisfying and the final result is amazing. For a full list of products visit www.ammonyc.com.
