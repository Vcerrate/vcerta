{% raw %}See our BIG Lathe in action and making chips! This video is a job showing step by step machining the ends of 2 large steel tubes in our big 7 metre lathe. The steel tubes are approximately 4 metres (12’ feet) long and 350mm (13 3/4” inches) in diameter and will eventually be a part of a Toomey Earthmovers All-in-one Laser bucket. After the machining we also need to weld in drive plates and end caps to each tube. We hope you enjoy seeing the big lathe in action!<br /><br />Check out Toomey Earthmovers All-in-one Laser Buckets here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-jqm3km4yHzj7TeejGHgXg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-jqm3km4yHzj7TeejGHgXg</a><br /><br />In this video we are using:<br />- Shenyang No.1 CW6280B Lathe<br />- WIA Weldmatic 500i welder<br /><br />Join our channel:<br />We upload new videos every Friday at 5pm AEST!
