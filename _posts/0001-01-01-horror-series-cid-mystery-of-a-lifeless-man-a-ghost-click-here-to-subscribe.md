Dramatic and absolutely unpredictable, C.I.D. has captivated viewers over the last eleven years and continues to keep audiences glued to their television sets with its thrilling plots and excitement. Also interwoven in its fast-paced plots are the personal challenges that the C.I.D. team faces with non-stop adventure, tremendous pressure, and risk, all in the name of duty. The series consists of hard-core police procedural stories dealing with investigation, detection, and suspense. The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam]. While the stories are plausible, there is an emphasis on dramatic plotting and technical complexities faced by the police. At every stage, the plot throws up intriguing twists and turns to keep the officers on the move as they track criminals, led by the smallest of clues.<br /><br />Horror Series | CID | Mystery Of A Lifeless Man &quot;A Ghost&quot;!{% endraw %}
