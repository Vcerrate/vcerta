You kidding?<br />That really suctions. Ok.<br />Now let's open up for public debate. What?Uh oh! Uh oh! Uh oh! Uh oh! Uh oh!<br />This would leave me scarred<br />Not in my back yard!<br />And they're just like<br /><br />Uh oh! Uh oh! Uh oh! Uh oh! Uh oh!<br />A community marred!<br />Not in my back yard!<br />I work in this town<br />You need to calm down<br /><br />Our community is great if you don't know<br />To change it's character would be loco<br />Our neighborhood's neat<br />That guy just crapped on the street<br /><br />Homes of luxury are an outrage!<br />Low income housing's what we want made!<br />With new construction killed<br />That kind of housing's being built<br /><br />This region's added jobs by the gobs<br />That's led to mobs of folks driving here in their Saabs<br />And they're pausing because there's nowhere to go (GENTRIFIERS!)<br />And sticks and stones never built new homes<br /><br />So Uh oh! Uh oh! Uh oh! Uh oh! Uh oh!<br />This isn't that hard<br />Not in my back yard!<br />And they're just like<br /><br />Uh oh! Uh oh! Uh oh! Uh oh! Uh oh!<br />You need to just stop<br />This is a crosswalk<br />I work in this town<br />You need to calm down…{% endraw %}
