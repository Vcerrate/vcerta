{% raw %}through sickness, sleep deprivation, stomachaches, and complete delirium, it has been done again. some things never change.<br /><br />guy: @Shwerpy  <br /><br />egg stream <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/eggsoup">https://www.twitch.tv/eggsoup</a><br />egg tweet <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/eggsouptv">https://twitter.com/eggsouptv</a><br />egg discord <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/wHCHW4X">https://discord.gg/wHCHW4X</a><br /><br />This is the third video in the Breaking Mental series with Shwerpy, the first being &quot;I broke Shwerpy's mental in 3 minutes.&quot; and the second being &quot;I broke Shwerpy's mental in 2 minutes.&quot; Why is it not titled 1, 2, and 3? I do not know. Next time perhaps I shall change it to seconds, if I were to be so inclined. Or perhaps I shall do it now, I have yet to decide. Regardless, I know that I was playing Shwerpy, not Sandstorm on Mordex and Scythe or Boomie on Boomie today. It was fun Brawlhalla gameplay with friends except he said we are not friends so I should just say Brawlhalla gameplay with. Alas, it appears to be 3:44am Good Night !<br /><br />music used: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/iDCacZjx">https://pastebin.com/iDCacZjx</a><br /><br />#eggsoup #shwerpy #brawlhalla{% endraw %}
