{% raw %}Big time, (at least in the UK, not so much in the US)<br /><br />Cases down, but not necessarily infections<br /><br />Confirmed government case data is missing thousands of LFT results, leading to massive under-reporting. <br /><br />This subtle but important change in behaviour, highlights the importance of having multiple methods to track COVID in the population,<br /><br />We saw a similar rebound and second peak during the Delta wave as people relaxed more and children went back to school. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits">https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.icnarc.org/our-audit/audits/cmp/reports">https://www.icnarc.org/our-audit/audits/cmp/reports</a><br /><br />CDC data<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e3.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e3.htm</a><br /><br />Three dose protection against omicron<br /><br />ED and urgent care encounters, 82% compared to unvaccinated<br /><br />Covid associated hospital admission, 90%<br /><br />Tim Spector<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUfjJ1z-a6s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUfjJ1z-a6s</a><br /><br />Reinfection<br /><br />7 to 8 % of cases had delta or alpha<br /><br />Association Between 3 Doses of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine and Symptomatic Infection Caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Delta Variants (21 Jan 2022 JAMA)<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2788485">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2788485</a><br /><br />Prior receipt of 3 mRNA vaccine doses was reported for 18.6% (n = 2441) of Omicron cases, <br /><br />approaching  200,000 new cases a day, <br /><br />hospitalisations, ICU cases and deaths are still coming down,<br /><br />as Omicron is less severe in a vaccinated population. <br /><br />It seems many are, again, preempting the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. <br /><br />It’s much too early for this.<br /><br />High case rates will likely be with us until late spring before the warmer weather and the summer holidays help reduce infections again. <br /><br />and shows the power of the citizen scientists that log with ZOE every day. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/uk-back-to-200-000-a-day">https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/uk-back-to-200-000-a-day</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/healthcare">https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/healthcare</a><br /><br />Northern<br /><br />I am a retired RN. Over the last several weeks I have had many friends and family come down with Covid, including myself. <br /><br />We all weathered it fine except for one, 61 y/o female relative. <br /><br />She developed pneumonia and ended up in hospital for 3 days. <br /><br />Thankfully, she is home now with oxygen PRN. <br /><br />But....she is the only one who is morbidly obese, type 2 diabetic with poorly controlled blood sugar. <br /><br />To me, that says a lot about risk.<br /><br />Pitchfork<br /><br />As a kid in grade school in Boston during the 1970s and 1980s, I remember that there were always about 3 or 4 kids who had weight problems in my class. <br /><br />When I was a substitute teacher from about 2000-2008, more than half of the students in any given class had weight problems. <br /><br />This problem has been trending in the wrong direction for decades in the US. <br /><br />Exacerbated by cheap, unhealthy fast food, and sedentary lifestyles.{% endraw %}
