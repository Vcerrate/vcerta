{% raw %}Breitling has always had one of the most distinct, alluring, and timeless design languages of any watch manufacturer and the references the brand produced in the ‘60s are both innovative and undeniably beautiful. In this episode of our series What Is On My Wrist, Craft + Tailored’s CEO and frequent flier Cam Barr shows off a lovely example of what we feel is one of Breitling’s greatest designs, the ref. 765CP Co-Pilot. This watch is more than just a pretty face; it was the actual watch most commonly seen on the wrist of Olympian and iconic alpine skier Jean-Claude Killy – not the Rolex Chrono commonly associated with the athlete and Rolex brand ambassador!  <br /><br />///<br /><br />#breitling765cp #breitlingcopilot #vintagewatches<br /><br />///<br /><br />Explore Longines Via The C+T Shop <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.craftandtailored.com/search?type=product&amp;q=longines">https://www.craftandtailored.com/search?type=product&amp;q=longines</a><br /><br />///<br />Craft + Tailored<br />Web:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.craftandtailored.com/">https://www.craftandtailored.com/</a><br />Questions:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.craftandtailored.com/contact-la-vintage-watches/">https://blog.craftandtailored.com/contact-la-vintage-watches/</a><br />IG:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/craftandtailored/">https://www.instagram.com/craftandtailored/</a>{% endraw %}
