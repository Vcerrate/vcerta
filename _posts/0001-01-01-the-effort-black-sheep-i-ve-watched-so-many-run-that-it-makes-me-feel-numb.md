{% raw %}I've watched so many run that it makes me feel numb when<br />I loose a good friend to another pointless trend.<br />I'm sick of superficial minds clogging the ears of our blind,<br />Blind because they cannot see their own dismal routines.<br />No matter what is your label, we've got to turn all the tables before it's too late.<br />And before we have the chance to state all the shit that is wrong with this society<br />In which we belong, where the privileged don't speak.<br />They're too busy fighting for their green.<br />This lack of hope has been jammed down my throat to the point<br />Where I only care about impending air.<br />As I chocked up, all the words came out<br />And I finally heard all the shit you had been talking about.<br />You said I wouldn't last too long. well you're wrong.<br />I am the black sheep of this country because I won't buy what they sell me.<br />My friend, that's what this X means.<br />It's the symbol of all my beliefs.<br />It's the ink that's been used by this world to cross out my words<br />So they wouldn't hold and to crush my defiant thoughts.<br />But it's only put a fire in my heart.<br />I can pick myself up when I'm down with this fire in my heart.{% endraw %}
