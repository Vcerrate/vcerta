{% raw %}We’re all different, and yet a few of us have rare features that occur in only a few percent of people. Today, we're going to tell you about some of them. Some are just nice physical features, but there are those Superman himself would envy. For example, there's a genetic condition that allows you to sleep much less than other people and not regret it at all. Better yet, there are no known side effects to it, so it’s an all-around win.<br /> <br />Or imagine falling from the roof of a ten-story building and getting away with a few bruises and scratches but no broken bones whatsoever! Such a genetic anomaly was discovered back in 1994. It makes a person’s bones about eight times denser than normal, which basically makes them indestructible. What’s even better is that the feature seems to be hereditary — it means he could pass it down to his kids. And they’ll become unbreakable too! Isn't it cool? So, here are some really exceptional physical skills and characteristics found in only a tiny percentage of people around the world.<br /><br />#brightside<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />Short sleeper syndrome 0:01<br />Uncombable hair syndrome 0:27<br />Extra pair of fingers 0:59<br />Triphalangeal thumb 1:35<br />Indestructible bones 2:08<br />Heterochromia 2:45<br />Perfect cholesterol 3:23<br />Tetrachromacy  3:50<br />Double crown 4:29<br />Super strong muscles 5:03<br />Super athlete gene 5:39<br />Golden blood 6:15<br />Double eyelashes 6:42<br />Different twins 7:12<br />Vitiligo 7:37<br />Cleft chin 8:00<br />Albinism 8:24<br />Ocular albinism 8:52<br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
