{% raw %}If you've been following my Back to Basics series and then the Back to Basics Revisited then this arrangement is an ideal step up from those basics skills taught in the first two series.<br /><br />I've introduced some large lily heads to complement the large heavy container.  With the addition of the striking orange roses, I've created a fabulous traditional triangle arrangement.  When you are confident enough you can upscale this design to make a large arrangement for a church, entrance way or open space.<br /><br />If you are new to arranging, take a few minutes to view my Back to Basics series which will explain how to create a very all round arrangement using a minimal amount of flowers.<br /><br /><br />Container<br />────────────────<br />Ceramic flower pot<br />Floral foam<br />Plastic dish<br /><br />Fresh Flowers<br />────────────────<br />Orange Asiatic lilies<br />Orange roses<br />Solidaster<br /><br />Fresh Foliage<br />__________________________<br />Birch twigs<br />Ladder fern<br />Conifer<br />Ruscus{% endraw %}
