{% raw %}25 NOT SO APPROPRIATE MOMENTS IN SPORTS<br /><br />Here are 25 NOT SO APPROPRIATE MOMENTS IN SPORTS . For those of you interested on how I make my videos, I primarily use Final Cut Pro X to edit my videos. I use different stock footages (both free and paid), clips of videos that I can find related to the video and search images to visualize the narrative and story that Iâ€™m trying to tell. All of which falls under fair use. I hire different researchers and writers for the script for each video along with my original commentary and hire different voice over actors that can properly convey the the theme of the video. Most importantly, find the best background music, usually royalty free from Incompetech and paid ones from Epidemic sounds to create an exciting atmosphere while watching the video. <br /><br />COZY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiVpkq5qOtpRxdXvYrQqskw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiVpkq5qOtpRxdXvYrQqskw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />More videos:<br />25 FUNNIEST AND MOST EMBARRASSING MOMENTS IN SPORTS : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U94kUcCI_TE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U94kUcCI_TE</a><br /><br />25 FUNNIEST BALL BOY AND GIRL MOMENTS : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAPndJxGQjs&amp;t=351s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAPndJxGQjs&amp;t=351s</a><br /><br />25 CRAZIEST EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTIONS : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pXK55deJ5M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pXK55deJ5M</a><br /><br />25 MOST UNBELIEVABLE MOMENTS IN SPORTS : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l01kMENhwKY&amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l01kMENhwKY&amp;t=1s</a>{% endraw %}
