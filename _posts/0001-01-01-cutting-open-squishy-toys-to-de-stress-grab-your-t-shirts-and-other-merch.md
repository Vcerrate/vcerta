I'm a 40 yr old mom who makes videos about the things I love. That is usually slime, crafting fidget toys, and collecting unique kawaii things.<br /><br />I collect Gudetama, anime toys and figures, Japanese toys, stress toys, and slime making items. I love all things sensory/tactile toys and items as these things calm me and help me focus on the world around me. I want you to have a comfortable and safe space here with me!  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This video is for entertainment only and you should not try to recreate anything you see here.
