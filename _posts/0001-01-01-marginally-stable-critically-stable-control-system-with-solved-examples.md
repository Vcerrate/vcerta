{% raw %}Marginally Stable/Critically Stable Control System <br />A system is marginally stable if  the natural response neither  decays nor grows but remains constant i.e. it  produces oscillations within a bound indefinitely.<br /><br />Marginal stability is also called as Neutral stability<br /><br />A system with pole at origin is also marginally stable but no oscillations will be produced as imaginary part also becomes zero.<br /><br />Definition:<br />A linear time invariant system is said to be marginally stable if <br /><br />For bounded input it produces oscillations of constant frequency and magnitude, such oscillations are called as un-damped or sustained oscillations.<br /><br />A system is marginally stable if it has one or more distinct poles on imaginary axis and any remaining poles have negative real parts <br /><br />Rules of finding Marginally stable systems:<br />1.The poles should lie on Imaginary axis(Complex Conjugate poles).<br /><br />2.The  poles should be non repeated  on imaginary axis.<br /><br />3.Remaining poles should lie on Left half of s-plane.<br /><br />4.No pole should lie on Right half of  s-plane.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />#MarginallyStableControlSystem<br />#CriticallyStableControlSystem<br />#RulesofFindingMarginalStability<br />#NeutralStability{% endraw %}
