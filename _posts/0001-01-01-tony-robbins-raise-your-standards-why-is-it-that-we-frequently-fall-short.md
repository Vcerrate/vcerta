{% raw %}Why is it that we frequently fall short of achieving our goals and ideals in life? Even when we have high values, we can still find that those values are not truly showing up in the way we live. In this video Tony Robbins explains briliantly how we need to placeless emphasis on setting goals, and more on shifting our sense of identity.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that we still identify ourselves with old patterns and habits. When we identify ourselves with those limiting beliefs, even having the best values and intentions won't shift us out of the old ways.<br /><br />We have to raise our standards. That means we have to step into a new identity of who we are and how we see ourself. By having a clear image of the kind of person we want to become, and then asuming that identity right now, we overcome our limiting beliefs. Instead of &quot;shoulds&quot; our values are &quot;musts&quot;. They take absolute priority. That is when we start to live with higher standards, and that is when we achieve our goals and aspirations.{% endraw %}
