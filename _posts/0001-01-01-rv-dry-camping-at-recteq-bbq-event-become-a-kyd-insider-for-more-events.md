Had we done a mock tire change before leaving for our first six-month trip (now known as Season 1), we would have figured out we needed a four-way wrench before we got stranded on the side of the road.<br />As you've heard on KYD before, &quot;We never make the same mistake twice. We make it five or six times, just to make sure we got it!&quot; Last year, we added the Firman generator to the back of our truck. Check! After several days of dry camping, this was the first time we used it‚Äîonly to find out that our surge protector was not allowing power due to an open ground fault. We also learned that we needed a 3-prong 30 amp adapter cord. (We'll save that lesson for a future video.) The moral of the story - test your gear before you go and if you have a fancy surge protector and plan on using a portable generator, you might want to make this doohickey! If you aren't into technical talk, don't worry‚Äîthis video isn't all about generators. That was just the halftime show while dry camping at Recteq HQ in Evans, GA. Recteq hosts an unbelievable BBQ smoking academy, including teachings from world champion BBQ competitors. If you enjoy grilling and backyard BBQ, you'll get a few tips from this episode. And if you've been eyeballing a Recteq pellet grill, now is the time to get one! Chef Greg is offering 10% off anything on their website for this week only with promo code KYD10.<br />We've thoroughly enjoyed our Recteq grill at the cabin. It's so easy, it makes cooking feel like cheating.<br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è KYD Insiders <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/KeepYourDaydream">https://www.patreon.com/KeepYourDaydream</a> <br />Join the most supportive and genuine RV community ever.
