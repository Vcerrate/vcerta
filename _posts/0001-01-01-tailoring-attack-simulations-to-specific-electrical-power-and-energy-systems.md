{% raw %}Tailoring Attack Simulations to Specific Electrical Power and Energy Systems<br /><br />Energy operators both have IT and OT systems, with both generic and specific components. The EnergyShield project develops a modeling language that enables power domain security experts to model their specific environment in depth. In this session and demonstration we will provide:<br />• An introduction to the EPES specific analysis capabilities<br />• Illustration of office IT, the OT-part inspired by MITRE ATT&amp;CK’s ICS matrix, and a substation based on the SCL definition.<br />• To show the languages capabilities, we will refer to models representing known attacks on the energy domain.<br /><br />Speaker: Dr. Simon Hacks, Postdoc in Software Systems Architecture and Security, Computer Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology<br /><br />For more information about securiCAD please visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://foreseeti.com/">https://foreseeti.com/</a><br /><br />Contact information:<br />foreseeti website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://foreseeti.com/">https://foreseeti.com/</a><br />email: marketing@foreseeti.com{% endraw %}
