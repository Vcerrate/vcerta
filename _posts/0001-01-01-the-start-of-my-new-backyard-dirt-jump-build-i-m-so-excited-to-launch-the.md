{% raw %}I'm so excited to launch the very first episode of this exciting new build and ride series! I've always loved digging and trail building. And the opportunity to build and ride my very own trails &amp; dirt jumps is one that I feel super lucky to have. The backyard trails build I did in lockdown was epic, and I know everyone watching the video was a huge part of the process and I hope that this will be no different. So this is episode one of the unnamed location and series that I can't wait to work super hard on. Please come up with some cool names for the new trails spot in the comments and enjoy this epic 3 day build lapse, FPV drone shots, digging and soon to be riding!<br />Legends.<br /><br />————————————————————————————<br /><br />Intro music by Damtaro - <br /><br />SoundCloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/damtaro">https://soundcloud.com/damtaro</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Damtaromusic">https://www.facebook.com/Damtaromusic</a><br />YouTube: ya.co.ve/Af8{% endraw %}
