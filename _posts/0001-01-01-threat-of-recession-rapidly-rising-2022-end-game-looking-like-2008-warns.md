{% raw %}&quot;Wheat's price is almost a guarantee for a global recession,&quot; says Mike McGlone, Commodities Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. &quot;Russia will be very dependent on fossil fuels,&quot; and the rest of the world will not be in the near future, he tells our Daniela Cambone. &quot;The United States is the world's largest exporter of liquified natural gas, and that's going to accelerate,&quot; he asserts. McGlone and Cambone discuss rising metals in rhodium and palladium, and further discuss the implications of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. &quot;It's a matter of time before gold passes the $2,000 mark and never looks back,&quot; says McGlone, &quot;but gold does have major competition from digital assets, including Bitcoin.&quot; With supply limiting and demand and adoption going up, Bitcoin may slump in the short-term, but long-term, &quot;it's just a matter of time before Bitcoin reaches $100,000.&quot;<br /><br />Join Daniela Cambone's exclusive community ➡️  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://danielacambone.com">https://danielacambone.com</a><br /><br />➡️  Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/StansberryResearch">https://www.facebook.com/StansberryResearch</a> <br />➡️  Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/stansberry">https://twitter.com/stansberry</a> <br />➡️  Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/stansberry_research">https://www.instagram.com/stansberry_research</a><br />➡️  Follow us on LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/stanberry-research">https://www.linkedin.com/company/stanberry-research</a>{% endraw %}
