{% raw %}A convoy of truckers are on their way from B.C. to Ottawa to protest the federal  government's mandate for cross-border truck drivers. Until January 15th, truck drivers were exempt from the border requirement to be fully vaccinated to come into Canada from the U.S. The U.S. government has stated it too will soon bring in a similar mandate for its drivers. The mandate will send drivers back at the border if they are not fully vaccinated and could have repercussions to an already challenged supply chain on both sides of the border. We welcome Mike Millian, president of the Private Motor Truck Council of Canada, to provide some context around this important issue.{% endraw %}
