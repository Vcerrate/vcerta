{% raw %}The Best Feel Good Aviation Story I’ve Ever Told!<br />Flying with one of the World’s Oldest Active Pilots and Flight Instructors!<br />Proudly associated with ForeFlight: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.foreflight.com/flightchops">https://www.foreflight.com/flightchops</a><br /><br />After arriving in Canada with Martin and Micke, ending our Atlantic Crossing Ferry Flight (episodes here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ctgzb2SDq4Y),">https://youtu.be/ctgzb2SDq4Y),</a> I help facilitate getting them an experience of a lifetime #flying a Stearman #warbird trainer.  <br />We met up my friend and mentor, and one of the most qualified pilots I know, Lieutenant Colonel (retired) Ron Holden, at the Canadian Aviation Museum in Windsor, Ontario.

Ron is a 90 year old retired RCAF pilot AND STILL certified as a flight Instructor for both #generalaviation and Aerobatics! <br /><br />View the full/raw cut of the T6 Harvard Solo Aerobatic flight on Ron’s 85th Birthday, available here for channel supporters:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/7580533">https://www.patreon.com/posts/7580533</a><br /><br />Ron’s Book - Pilot Stories (Highly Recommended!) is available in the gift shop at the Canadian Aviation Museum and online at the FlightChops Merch Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://flightchops.store/product/rons-book-a-pilots-stories/">https://flightchops.store/product/rons-book-a-pilots-stories/</a> <br />*Proceeds will be donated to the Canadian Aviation Museum<br /><br />The Canadian Aviation Museum is an 18,000 square foot historical aircraft hangar, home to Windsor's own Lancaster bomber, Mosquito KB161, Two DHC-1 Chipmunks, Stearman, T-33, T-6 Harvard, and the Fairchild 24R Argus, as well as a soon to be airworthy Tiger Moth and Cornell.

I have had my PPL for over 15 years, but still consider each flight a learning experience - I generally take detailed notes after each flight to remind myself what went well or what I could do to improve.... Having GoPro cameras to record flights like this is invaluable. I find these self analysis videos very helpful in my constant quest to improve, and am happy to share. Feedback is invited; however, please keep it positive.<br />Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.FlightChops.com/">https://www.FlightChops.com/</a> for behind-the-scenes content, epic giveaways and to search episodes by aircraft type!{% endraw %}
