So in this video I finally live our my childhood dreams by fighting alongside 50 Spidermen. Unexpectedly, Big Matt got taken by a super villain and I had to train to become a full fledged superhero to get him back. My friend @Zealous served as my mentor until I was ready to take down the evil villain. This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next!<br /><br />If youâ€™re reading this youâ€™re a real one! <br />Comment â€˜â€™Spidermen Unite!&quot; so I can notice you!<br /><br />Not No Way Home, But the Amazing Spider-Man, But Marvel Universe, But Hire 50 Bodyguards, But Hired 100 FAKE Paparazzi, But 100 Myths, But 100 Fears, But 24 Hours, or any other video Airrack, Sony, MCU, MrBeast, Hyper, MoreJStu, Stokes Twins, Unspeakable, Dangie Bros, Ryan Prunty, or Ben Azelart would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) hires 50 Spiderman to protect LA and save his friend from an evil villain who escaped from the Spider-Verse.{% endraw %}
