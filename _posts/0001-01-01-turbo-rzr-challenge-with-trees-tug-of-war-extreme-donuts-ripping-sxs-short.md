{% raw %}Pro XP HAULS 16 FOOT CHRISTMAS TREE! The Dirt Dudes are at Twisted Trails Off Road Park in Copemish, Michigan for the annual Tree Burning Party. Everyone brings their Christmas trees and you ride all day and end with your tree in the fire. Zack is ripping Luci the Polaris RZR Turbo S, Nick has his RZR Turbo and Break-It-Jake is back in his RZR Pro XP after getting it fixed up from hitting a deer. Today is based on who can do the best donuts, cyclones, tug of war, and laps on the SXS track with a tree. Remember, Twisted Trails is where Red Bull is going to be holding their Snow Scramble next month (February 19th). It's a Joe's vs Pro's style with a Sportsman Class and a Pro Class. Link is below to register for the race. How many Dirt Dude Christmas trees actually make it to the Tree Burning Party? &amp; Stay tuned for some big races coming up in this next month! <br /><br />RED BULL <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.redbull.com/us-en/events/snow-scramble">https://www.redbull.com/us-en/events/snow-scramble</a><br /><br />HELP SUPPORT THE DIRT DUDES!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/DirtDudesUTV">https://www.patreon.com/DirtDudesUTV</a><br /><br />Wanna represent Dirt Dudes UTV??
