{% raw %}In this week’s show, Alex Cole takes a look at how equities have failed to move higher this week, making it more likely that last week’s rally in equities was a relief rally, not the start of something more constructive. Starting from the top down, he looks at the asset trends, the relative outperforming/underperforming sectors and how the resumption of Go trends in treasury rates and the dollar will impact stocks. He moves on to discuss how tech stocks, such as Meta (FB), continue to struggle and may provide a play for those on the short side. He also shows how GoNoGo Charts tell you when a trade hasn’t worked in the way you’d expect. Finally, in an effort to find some blue Go colors, he takes a look at some energy stocks!<br /><br />00:00 - Introduction<br />00:59 - GoNoGo CrossAsset HeatMap®<br />05:09 - SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)<br />06:31 - Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (UUP)<br />08:40 - Treasury Yield 10 Years ($TNX)<br />10:41 - Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)<br />13:48 - Meta Platforms, Inc.
