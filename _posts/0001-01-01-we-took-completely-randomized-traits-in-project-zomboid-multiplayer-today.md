{% raw %}Today, in Project Zomboid multiplayer, TwinTurBros and I took completely random traits and challenged ourselves to survive. Coupled with a random spawn location, we gave ourselves a single goal: to reach Louisville. <br /><br />Will we succeed in this random traits challenge in Project Zomboid? Or will bad luck guide us to failure?<br /><br />TwinTurBros: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFxkDf2kb38_nyn6hRQO-3A">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFxkDf2kb38_nyn6hRQO-3A</a><br /><br />Join the Discord! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/De5hDs9">https://discord.com/invite/De5hDs9</a><br /><br />Follow me on Twitch?
