{% raw %}Our fresh counters in store are an important part of Booths; stocked with fresh, local produce we have developed great partnerships with our suppliers, complemented by our in store colleagues' specialist knowledge.<br /><br />Discover a Delicatessen, a Cheesemonger, a Butcher, and a Fishmonger, as well as a Hot Counter and Bakery. A few of our stores even have their own special twists, such as a Patisserie counter and a Chocolatier counter. <br /><br />-<br /><br />You’ll find 28 of our stores dotted around the Northwest of England, each one with its own variety of special, local and unique products and seasonal events. We're a family-run business, and since 1847 we have worked closely with local suppliers and producers from the Northern counties we call home: Lancashire, Cheshire, Cumbria, and Yorkshire, which we affectionately call 'Booths Country.' <br /><br />Our producers, from the Northwest of England and beyond, supply us with a diverse range of often award-winning food and drink, from Cumbrian artisan bread to Lancashire-grown cauliflowers to authentic Italian pasta. What drives them all is pride in producing a quality product, and what drives us is a love of great food and drink! Over the years we've worked together, we've developed really strong, mutually supportive relationships with our producers and we're proud to be able to put their goods on our shelves, in our fridges and on our counters. We think of them as part of our Booths family. <br /><br />In each of our stores you'll find an array of fresh counters, stocked to the brim with delicious morsels — our cheese counters (and colleagues) are especially well renowned! Discover a Delicatessen, a Cheesemonger, a Butcher, and a Fishmonger, as well as a Hot Counter and Bakery. A few of our stores even have their own special twists, such as a Patisserie counter and a Chocolatier counter. We have an award-winning licensed selection, winning Decanter Retailer Awards Supermarket of the Year 2020 and Drinks Retailing Awards Multiple Spirits Retailer of the Year 2020 to name just two, as well as having a widely acclaimed craft beer and ale selection. In some stores you'll find eateries too, from cosy cafes to a sophisticated tapas bar.
