{% raw %}Get it here: smarturl.it/CPEP43<br /><br />Colyn develops his unique sound with a second EP for Afterlife.<br />On ‘Patterns’, he weaves the emotive vocals of his brother Maurits Colijn around a downbeat rhythm and dreamy, synth melody. It sets the tone for a euphoric set of creations which draw from diverse influences and a rich sonic palette. The following tracks dial up the intensity, showing the more club-focused edge to Colyn’s talents. They are radiant and uplifting; delicately balanced on the border of styles, it’s a space Colyn can call his own.<br /><br />Colyn - Patterns EP (AL043)<br />A1 Patterns ft.
