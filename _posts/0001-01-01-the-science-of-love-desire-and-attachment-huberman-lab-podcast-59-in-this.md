{% raw %}In this episode, I discuss the psychology and biology of desire, love and attachment. I explain how childhood attachment types are thought to inform adult attachment styles to romantic partners, and I describe some of the major theories of human mate selection, relationships and infidelity. Additionally, I explore the neurobiology and proposed subconscious processing underlying desire, love and attachment, including the roles of empathy and “positive delusion.” I outline how self-awareness can shift one’s relationship attachment style towards securely bonded partnerships.  Finally, I describe specific tools and supplements that have been researched to increase libido and sex drive. Throughout the episode, I explain the science and key mechanisms underlying romantic love and outline tools for those seeking to find a strong, healthy relationship, or for those wanting to strengthen an existing relationship. <br /><br />#HubermanLab #Neuroscience #Love<br /><br />Thank you to our sponsors<br />Thesis: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://takethesis.com/huberman">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a><br />AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a> <br />InsideTracker: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a><br /><br />Our Patreon page<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman">https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman</a><br /><br />Supplements from Thorne<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thorne.com/u/huberman">https://www.thorne.com/u/huberman</a><br /><br />Social &amp;
