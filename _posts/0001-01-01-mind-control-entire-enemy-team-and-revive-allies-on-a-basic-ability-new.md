{% raw %}The new support is actually really fun! Renata seems like she'd be super broken on the surface (and she is right now) but it's more because of the duration and effect of her w being refreshed on kill instead of the revive and also because her ult has a crazy long duration at level 3. Revive is just good clickbait :)<br /><br />Runes: Sorcery - Summon Aery, Manaflow Band, Transcendence, Scorch<br />Inspiration - Biscuits, Cosmic Insight<br />Secondaries - CDR, AD, Armor<br /><br />Remember to 'Like' and Subscribe if you enjoy the video!
