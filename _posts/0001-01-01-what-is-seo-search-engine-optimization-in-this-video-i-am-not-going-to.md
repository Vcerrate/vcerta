{% raw %}In this video, I am not going to tell you how to do Search Engine Optimization. It‚Äôs a dark art and there are many websites, courses, and videos which will claim to give good knowledge. If that‚Äôs what you need, then you‚Äôre excused. In this video, I simply want to give a brief overview for people who need a simple, clear, and accurate description of what SEO is, and why it matters.<br /><br />Watching this video is worth 3 Management Courses CPD Points*.<br />üîé See below for details<br /><br />Marketing for Managers<br />This video is part of course module number 8.3.4<br />Program 8: Managing Customers &amp; Clients<br />Course 3: Marketing for Managers<br />Section 4: Online Marketing<br /><br />Other videos in this section include:<br />üé¨ What is Permission Marketing?

It compares to paid traffic that result from advertising.<br /><br />SEO works by knowing two things:<br />1. How Search engines work and the algorithms they use to select which sites they present to users, based on a given search query<br />2. Understanding people and how they search online, the answers they want, the words they use, and the type of content they like. <br />Combining these two allows you to tailor your content so search engine crawlers can find and understand it.<br /><br />White hat SEO refers to techniques that follow search engine rules. It aims to provide a good service to would-be users of your content.<br /><br />Black hat SEO refers to techniques that set out to fool search engines into serving content that may not be in the best interest of users. It can work, of course. But it lacks integrity, puts your reputation at risk, and places websites under threat of being penalized and even de-indexed (removed from search results) by search engines.<br /><br />Good Practices<br />‚Ä¢ Make your web pages primarily for users, not search engines<br />‚Ä¢ Page speed is important<br />‚Ä¢ So too is a pleasant user experience.<br />‚Ä¢ Use metadata to fairly describe content - text, images, tables, quotes, etc.<br />‚Ä¢ Make your URLs short and descriptive, and avoid non-letter characters.<br />Things to Avoid<br />‚Ä¢ Poor content <br />‚Ä¢ Deceitful content<br /><br /><br />RECOMMENDED EXERCISE<br />1. Choose 3 web pages from different sites you visit. Observe:<br />- good SEO practices<br />- bad SEO practices<br />- are they wholly white hat SEO, or do you see evidence of black hat SEO <br />(3x2 MC CPD Points)<br /><br />00:00 - Search engine Optimization - SEO<br />00:38 - Definition of Search Engine Optimization<br />00:52 - Paid and Unpaid Search Traffic<br />01:11 - What a Search Engine is<br />02:28 - White Hat and Black Hat SEO<br />03:06 - Black Hat SEO<br />04:04 - SEO good practices<br />05:47 - SEO things to avoid<br />07:35 - Does SEO matter?<br />08:08 - SEO and YouTube search<br />08:37 - The other reason why SEO matters<br /><br />DOWNLOADS<br />Free Resources<br />üß∞ CPD Tools - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gum.co/MC-CPD">https://gum.co/MC-CPD</a><br />Paid resources<br />üß≥ Management Courses Onboarding Kit - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gum.co/MC-ObK">https://gum.co/MC-ObK</a> ($3)<br /><br />RECOMMENDED READING<br />üìñ Very quick overview<br />Marketing: A Very Short Introduction <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/ozSJF">https://geni.us/ozSJF</a><br />üìñ Good general overviews<br />Kotler on Marketing <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/JNeVHy">https://geni.us/JNeVHy</a><br />Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/kGj4KCA">https://geni.us/kGj4KCA</a><br />The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/RVU1">https://geni.us/RVU1</a><br />Marketing For Dummies <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/sZXAw">https://geni.us/sZXAw</a><br />üìñ Small business marketing<br />The 1-Page Marketing Plan <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/Xb4wBk">https://geni.us/Xb4wBk</a> <br />üìñ For a textbook, you can‚Äôt go wrong with Kotler‚Äôs name on it!<br />Marketing: An Introduction <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/q4gzVOw">https://geni.us/q4gzVOw</a><br />Principles of Marketing <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/gsFeMT5">https://geni.us/gsFeMT5</a><br />Marketing Management <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/i3FO">https://geni.us/i3FO</a><br /><br />‚≠ïÔ∏è Links to our book recommendations are affiliated through Amazon<br /><br />Managers Need a Basic set of kit to do your job well.
