{% raw %}an original song, 'unconscious'.<br /><br />[LYRICS]<br />-<br />Oh why can’t you<br />Breathe harder<br />And try to live<br />Cause I don’t know what I’d do without you<br /><br />Oh why can’t you<br />Breathe clearer<br />And try to live<br />Cause I don’t know what I’d do my dear<br /><br />I’ve woken up a thousand times<br />And everyday I’ve lived my life<br />Stupid to think that words don’t mean what they do anymore<br />Cause what they say does not describe you<br /><br />And now she lays in her bed, unconscious<br />And now you talk about how she had problems<br />Can't you see that you're the ones who caused them<br />She doesn't see the world like it sees her<br />And she doesn't see the world like it sees her<br /><br />Oh why can’t you<br />Breathe harder<br />And try to live<br />Cause I don’t know what I’d do without you<br />Oh why can’t you<br />Breathe clearer and try to live<br />Cause I don’t know what I’d do my dear<br /><br />And now she lays in her bed, unconscious<br />And now you talk about how she had problems<br />Can't you see that we're the ones who caused them<br />She doesn't see the world like it sees her<br />And she doesn't see the world like it sees her<br /><br />They say you're strong<br />But strong's impossible<br />When the world's on top of you<br /><br />I'd have been glad<br />To help if you needed it<br />But I should've seen it<br />From a mile away<br /><br />From a mile away<br />From a mile away<br />From a mile away<br /><br />And now she lays in her bed, unconscious<br />And now you talk about how she had problems<br />You know we could've been the ones who solved them <br />She doesn't see the world like it sees her<br />And she'll never see the world like it saw her{% endraw %}
