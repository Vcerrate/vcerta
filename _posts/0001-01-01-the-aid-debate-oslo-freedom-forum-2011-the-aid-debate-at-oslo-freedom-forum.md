{% raw %}The Aid Debate at Oslo Freedom Forum 2011<br /><br />www.OsloFreedomForum.com<br />@OsloFF<br />#OsloFF<br /><br />In this panel on foreign aid—moderated by Craig Johnstone, UN Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees—participants with diverse backgrounds and views discuss the pros and cons of international assistance. Panelists include humanitarian expert Jan Egeland, who held positions with the Red Cross, Amnesty International, and the United Nations; Philippe Douste-Blazy, former foreign minister of France and chairman of UNITAID; Ghanaian economist George Ayittey; and Burmese refugee and activist Zoya Phan. While the panelists agree that humanitarian aid is helpful in saving lives, they conclude that it is only a superficial solution to the problem. The political roots of conflict must ultimately be addressed in order to create long-term prosperity and progress in a region. The panel tackles the issue of conditionality: should nations offering assistance place certain restrictions on their aid? Ayittey brings attention to the dangers of conditionality now that countries like China are increasingly involved in Africa; they offer aid free of any human rights requirements, hoping only to benefit from natural resources. The discussion also addresses what should be done to help the new democracies of North Africa and the Middle East. On this issue, the panelists are most divided, with Egeland and Douste-Blazy stressing investment and Ayittey in strong disagreement. Ayittey warns of the danger of pouring money into countries that are not yet fully transitioned to democracy. Of course, with the high unemployment high and fragile economies of the Arab world, there is not much time to implement reform. As is always the case with foreign aid, the international community must move swiftly, yet cautiously, to prevent crisis and ensure that its good intentions translate into the desired results.{% endraw %}
