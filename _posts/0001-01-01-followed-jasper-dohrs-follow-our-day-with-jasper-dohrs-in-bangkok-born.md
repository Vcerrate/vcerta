{% raw %}Follow our day with Jasper Dohrs in Bangkok. Born and raised in Seattle he decided to make the move to Bangkok in 2014 when we met him &amp; instantly became friends. Jasper's creativity on his board carries out through his whole life as you can see as this day goes by. We meet at his place, go for a swim, check out the new Preduce Skateboards HQ and hit some spots before ending our day in the sauna. Enjoy exploring Bangkok with Jasper, Fifa Tintarn &amp; Joseph Sirinut. <br /><br />Filmed by Janchai Montrelerdrasme<br />Edited by Bennet Rahm<br />Motion Graphics by Stephan PÃ¶hlmann <br /><br />Get our books &amp; apparel collection here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pocketskatemag.com/shop/">https://pocketskatemag.com/shop/</a><br /><br />Feel free to subscribe to our channel and follow us on Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/pocketskatemag">http://www.instagram.com/pocketskatemag</a> <br /><br />Our Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pocketskatemag.com">http://www.pocketskatemag.com</a>{% endraw %}
