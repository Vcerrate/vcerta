{% raw %}Introduced in 1956, although some pilots feel the Skylane is the world’s best all-around four-seat single. It’s not hard to understand that sentiment. The 182 offers typical Cessna simplicity, reasonable climb and cruise, good useful load, and parts availability practically through your local maintenance shops. Skylanes use either a normally aspirated or turbocharged, 235hp Lycoming IO-540 engine, the climb is better than 900 feet per minute in both models, and cruise speed runs 165mph over 1000miles range, with 1000pounds useful load. Perhaps best of all, though, Skylanes of all ages and descriptions have earned the almost universal respect of pilots, because they’re forgiving machines, willing to ignore all but the most major indiscretions, and still bring you home safely, just like 172 Skyhawk younger brother. With $500,000, you can get this airplane brand new, or less than $100,000 for a used model.
