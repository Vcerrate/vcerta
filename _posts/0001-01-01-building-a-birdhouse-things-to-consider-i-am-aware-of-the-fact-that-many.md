{% raw %}I am aware of the fact that many of my viewers enjoy the silence and sound of tools in some of my previous videos. This time there was simply too much information to put into text, so i wanted to experiment with a voice-over. <br /><br />If you would like me to add voice commentary to my videos every now and then in the future, let me know.<br /><br />THE BIRDHOUSES:<br /><br />I had a bunch of reclaimed wood from an old sauna building that I recently renovated. The exterior grade plywood was scrap from construction site dumpsters. Making 50 birdhouses required about 1,5 kg of 4x50 mm screws and 1 liter of wood glue. Time estimate is about 20 hours of work.<br /><br />This particular birdhouse model is based on recommendations from Birdlife Finland, and has proven suitable for:<br /><br />European pied flycatcher<br />Great tit<br />Eurasian blue tit<br />Coal tit (entrance and height ideally smaller)<br /><br />DIMENSIONS:<br /><br />Bottom: 10 x 10 cm, inset between walls<br />Height: 30 cm<br />Sides: 1x6&quot; rough sawn<br />Front &amp; back: 1x4&quot; rough sawn<br />Roof angle: about 10Â°, forward slant<br />Entrance: 30-32 mm, center @ 8 cm from top of front wall<br />All wood should be untreated, at least on the inside.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Music: PC III (Pipe Choir III) - Adam Are You Free?<br />Licensed under a CC Attribution License<br />Downloaded from Free Music Archive<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://freemusicarchive.org/">http://freemusicarchive.org/</a>{% endraw %}
