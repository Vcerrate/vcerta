{% raw %}#mementomori meditations for lent ❤️<br /><br />Lord help us persevere in faith when our hands are tied. Also thank you Father Stephen Gadberry for reminding us to not be defined by our failures or what we do. Remember to do small sacrifices through out the day. <br /><br />Father Gadberry shared real concrete examples of how to persevere in life when our hands are tied. For example if you have a teen or a young adult going in a different direction… he shares what you can do. <br /><br />Meditations were amazing and such great wisdom after shared by Father. <br /><br />Don’t worry! God is with you.{% endraw %}
