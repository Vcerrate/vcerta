{% raw %}Philippine House Building Day 124 - The Pool Went Wrong<br /><br />Yes something went kind of wrong.<br />Fortunately we caught it reasonably early, and got back on track quite quickly.<br />The perimeter wall build competition is approaching a stunning climax - and you will help to decide the winner.<br />Elsewhere, lots of house wall plastering.<br />The air conditioning installation crew moved on to the gas and communication piping.<br />And more doors were installed.<br />Overall, a Buildelicious day.{% endraw %}
