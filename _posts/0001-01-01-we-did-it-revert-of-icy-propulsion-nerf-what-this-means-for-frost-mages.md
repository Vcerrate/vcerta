{% raw %}Hello there, friendly 9.2 patch waiter. This is the change that you certainly were hoping to. After a disaster of a nerf to Frost Mages on the PTR, Blizzard is going to revert the worst change - Icy Propulsion nerf. They will nerf Blizzard and Frozen Orb further, so the nerf still remains big for AoE and Mythic+ situation. They certainly didn't expect that Icy Propulsion Conduit change is going to have this much of an effect on Solo Target Frost Mages, so they had to change it. Good job on the outcry :D<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Markonicus">https://www.patreon.com/Markonicus</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/markonicus">https://www.twitch.tv/markonicus</a><br /><br />#mage #wow #frost<br /><br />Tracks:<br />Celtic Fairy Prophecy - Ean Grimm<br />You can download these tracks here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gumroad.com/tubersongs">https://gumroad.com/tubersongs</a><br />License: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3h8zFvY">https://bit.ly/3h8zFvY</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2EqLtvc">https://bit.ly/2EqLtvc</a><br /><br />Digital Artist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.deviantart.com/damiankrzy...">https://www.deviantart.com/damiankrzy...</a><br />Instagram instagram.com/damiankrzywonos<br />Facebook: facebook.com/damiankrzywonos<br />Youtube: youtube.com/damiankrzywonos<br />Artstation: www.artstation.com/damiankrzywâ€¦<br />Virink: virink.com/damiankrzywonos{% endraw %}
