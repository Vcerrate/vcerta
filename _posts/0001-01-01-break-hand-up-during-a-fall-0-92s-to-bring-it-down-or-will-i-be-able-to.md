{% raw %}Will I be able to bring my break hand down or my hand will get sucked into Belaying Device?<br /><br />If a Climber Falls while Belayers break hand is up many belaying devices won't provide enough assistance and might result into burned break hand and potentially fatal accident.<br /><br />In this experiment I used skinny 9.0 Mammut Sender Rope to maximise the change of failure!<br />I highly recommend to not try this! None of the catches felt comfortable!<br /><br />If you are getting value out of my videos and wanna feel good - consider supporting me: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hardiseasy.com">https://hardiseasy.com</a><br />Because that makes a big difference and is the main reason that allows me do this project!<br />Deep Thanks!<br />Ben<br /><br />â™« Music for my videos comes from<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/yeiaom">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/yeiaom</a>{% endraw %}
