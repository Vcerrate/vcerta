{% raw %}The International UNESCO Chairs Forum on the Futures of Higher Education is being organized jointly by<br />Italy and UNESCO at Expo 2020 Dubai to mark the International Day of Education 2022. The Forum fits within<br />the overall framework of UNESCOâ€™s Futures of Education initiative which seeks to generate an agenda for<br />global debate, research and action on the futures of education, learning and knowledge in a world of<br />increasing complexity, uncertainty and precarity. It is also one of the preparatory events for the 3rd UNESCO<br />World Higher Education Conference (WHEC2022) to be held 18-20 May 2022 in Barcelona, Spain. WHEC2022<br />and its preparatory events aim to define and prepare knowledge-based, participatory scenarios to shape a<br />new era of higher education systems and institutions, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19disruption.{% endraw %}
