{% raw %}Sonic and Amy Rose have been a will-they-won't-they type deal forever... but only in poor Amy's head. All the girl wants is for the boy she likes to notice her, so she's turned to a friend for advice. Naturally. It's just a shame that friend is Tails.<br /><br />Watch Sonic the Hedgehog turn down the advances of a young woman in our latest cartoon... and also make sure to never use any of Miles' advice in your own life. That fox is messed up...<br /><br />Produced by Tom Jenkins and Ben Michael<br />Written by Jason Dewey and Ben Michael<br />Pre-Production and Animatic by Ben &quot;Wonchop&quot; Smallman<br />Rough Animation by Ben &quot;Wonchop&quot; Smallman, BillyBCreations (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BillyBcreations),">https://www.youtube.com/user/BillyBcreations),</a> Claire MacKenzie and Liam McKeown<br />Clean Up by Ben &quot;Wonchop&quot; Smallman, BillyBCreations, Claire MacKenzie, Tim Bender (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/HypemationOfficial)">https://www.youtube.com/HypemationOfficial)</a> and Liam McKeown<br />Colour by Ben &quot;Wonchop&quot; Smallman, BillyBCreations, Claire MacKenzie, Tim Bender and Liam McKeown<br />Backgrounds by Jenny Polden (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/zannyhyper)">https://twitter.com/zannyhyper)</a> <br />Additional Backgrounds by Isa Gross<br /><br />Voice of Amy &amp; Tails by Eileen 'Eilemonty' Montgomery<br />Voice of Sonic and Knuckles by Blake Swift<br />Edit and Sound Design by Jason Dewey<br />Additional SFX, Mix and Music Composed by Alex Walker Smith<br /><br />üî¥ Subscribe to Mashed now so you never miss a new video!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=mashed">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=mashed</a><br /><br />Keep in touch &amp; stay up to date on all things #Mashed!<br /><br />üìò Mashed Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/thisismashed">http://facebook.com/thisismashed</a><br /><br />üê¶ Mashed Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/mashed">http://twitter.com/mashed</a><br /><br />üì∏ Mashed Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thisismashed">https://www.instagram.com/thisismashed</a> <br /><br />üéµ Mashed Tiktok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thisismashed">https://www.tiktok.com/@thisismashed</a><br /><br />üìß Mashed Email: mashed@theconnectedset.com{% endraw %}
