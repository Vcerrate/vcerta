As passionate fans of these shows, we provide news, analysis and fan engagement on America’s Got Talent, Britain’s Got Talent, The Masked Singer, The Voice, The X Factor, American Idol, The Four and its contestants.<br /><br />ABOUT AMERICAN IDOL<br />AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, returned to the airwaves in February 2021 for its forth season at its new home on ABC. The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2019, as the virtual Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering many cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform. Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.<br /><br />Talent Recap<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/nZgzW8">https://goo.gl/nZgzW8</a>{% endraw %}
