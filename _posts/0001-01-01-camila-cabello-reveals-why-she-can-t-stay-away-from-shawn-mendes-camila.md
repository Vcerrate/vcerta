{% raw %}Camila Cabello Reveals Why She Can't Stay Away From Shawn Mendes<br /><br />It’s been months since Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes broke up but apparently, they just can’t stay away from each other. But what exactly is keeping them glued to each other? And is there a chance that Shawn and Camila could get back together?<br /><br />Okay, after Shawn and Camila broke up, Camila opened up about the struggles in their relationship before their split and revealed that anxiety got in the way of their connection a lot of the time. She said on Apple Fitness+, “I felt so anxious, cripplingly anxious.
