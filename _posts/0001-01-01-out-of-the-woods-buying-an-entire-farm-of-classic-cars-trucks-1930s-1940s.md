{% raw %}Mr. Goodpliers heads up to Nebraska to check in with a friend who bought an entire farm of vintage 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s Chevrolet cars and trucks! The easy part is buying them, but getting them out of the woods takes time and manpower... Come along to see the process! This is Part One of a three part series. Stay tuned for more from this spot!<br />For any inquiries, please send an email to mrgoodpliers1985@gmail.com{% endraw %}
