With corruption now so deeply entrenched at all levels of life and government, new revelations of gross and corrupt behavior have lost their ability to shock.<br /><br />Todayâ€™s Tale of Corruption comes to us courtesy of Open The Books, a U.S. non-profit advocacy agency dedicated to tracking government expenditures.<br /><br />After being forced by the NIH to file a federal suit, Open The Books was able to determine that the NIH received over $350 million in kick-backs from pharma companies over the years.<br /><br />So, the model, such as it is, is that Fauci and the NIH distribute some $30 billion of taxpayer money to Big Pharma and then receive hundreds of millions from for-profit companies that then license some of the findings resulting from that money.<br /><br />And this is only the NIH. Presumably, university researchers similarly benefit from patent royalties developed using funds provided by U.S. taxpayers.<br /><br />Join the Tribe to find out more! <br />Part 2 here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://peakprosperity.com/red-flags-everywhere/?utm_source=YouTube+&amp;utm_medium=Card&amp;utm_campaign=220517+Eps+61+YouTube">https://peakprosperity.com/red-flags-everywhere/?utm_source=YouTube+&amp;utm_medium=Card&amp;utm_campaign=220517+Eps+61+YouTube</a>{% endraw %}
