{% raw %}Hi! A super giant car across the ocean has arrived in the city in the BeamNG.Drive game. The police are alarmed. All police forces are sent to stop the monster car. A huge red car easily crushes police roadblocks, turning everything that gets in its way into pancakes. If you like movies about giant monsters like Godzilla you will love this video.<br /><br />About the Game:<br />Beamng drive is a race car game that uses a soft-body physics engine. Every component of a Beam NG vehicle is simulated in real-time using mass points and beams. In addition, crashes feel realistic, as the game uses an incredibly accurate damage model. This early access game is not complete, but you can play it already now.<br /><br />Beamng drive mods: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.beamng.com/resources/">https://www.beamng.com/resources/</a>{% endraw %}
